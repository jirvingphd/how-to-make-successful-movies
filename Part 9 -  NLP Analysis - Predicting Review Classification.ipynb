    "## Tasks\n",
    "For this part of the project, you will using machine learning and deep NLP to classify the reviews.\n",
    "### Repo Prep\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a `\"Models/\"` folder in your project repository, with the following sub-folders: \n",
    "    - `\"Models/ml/\"`. You will save your sklearn model pipelines here for later use in deployment.\n",
    "    - `\"Models/nn/\"`. You will save your tensorflow models here for later use in deployment.\n",
    "- Add new subfolders to your \"Data-NLP/\"\" folder.\n",
    "    - Specifically, create:\n",
    "        - `\"Data-NLP/ml/\"` folder. We will save your training and test data (X_train,y_train) for later use in deployment.\n",
    "        - `\"Data-NLP/nn/\"` folder.  We will save your training and test Tensorflow datasets for later use in deployment.\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Create a new notebook for Part 6 - Review Classification for this part of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the joblib containing the dataframe from Part 5 of the project.\n",
    "- Use the original review column as X and the classiifcation target (High/Low Rating Reviews) as y.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning\n",
    "For this project, you will use modeling pipelines with the text vectorizer and model in the same pipeline. This will make it very easy to use save and load the models to use in a deployed application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Text Vectorizer\n",
    "- Select an sklearn vectorizer to for your task.\n",
    "    - Remember to consider your preprocessing choices like using stopwords, using ngrams, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build a Machine Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build an sklearn modeling pipeline with a text vectorizer and a classification model.\n",
    "    - Suggested Models: MultinomialNB, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier \n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit and evaluate the model using the machine learning classification models from sklearn.\n",
    "    - In a Markdown cell, document your observations from your results. (e.g. how good is the model overall? Is it particularly good/bad at predicting one class?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### GridSearch Text Vectorization \n",
    "Attempt to improve on yourm model by tuning the text preprocessing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct a grid of parameters for the text vectorization step. Consider trying:\n",
    "    - CountVectorizer/TfidfVectorizer\n",
    "    - stopwords\n",
    "    - ngram_range\n",
    "    - min_df/max_df\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit and evaluate the gridsearch results:\n",
    "    - What were the best parameters?\n",
    "    - How does the best estimator perform when evaluated on the training and test data?\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Save the Best Model and Train/Test Data  as Joblibs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save your overall best model pipeline as the only variable in a .joblib file in your new Models/ folder. (e.g. \"Models/ml/best-clf-logreg.joblib\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save a list containing `[X_train, y_train]` as `\"Data-NLP/ml/train-data.joblib\"`\n",
    "- Save a list containing `[X_test,y_test]`  as `\"Data-NLP/ml/test-data.joblib\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep NLP (RNNs)\n",
    "For this part of the project, you will use a Keras TextVectorization layer as part of your RNN model. This serves the same purpose as using the sklearn pipeline: it bundles text preparation into the model itself, making it deployment-ready.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "###  Create train/test/val datasets\n",
    "- Convert the target categories to integers (e.g. Using sklearn's LabelEncoder) \n",
    "- Create a tensorflow dataset using the X and  (integer version) of y.\n",
    "- Split the dataset into a training, test, and validation datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Keras Text Vectorization layer\n",
    "- Create a keras text vectorization layer to use in an RNN (sequence) model.\n",
    "- Fit/Adapt the text vectorization layer on the training texts.\n",
    "- Save the vocabulary size from layer to use in your models' Embedding layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build an RNN with the TextVectorization Layer\n",
    "- Build and fit at least 1 sequence model (LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional, etc)\n",
    "- Evalaute the model on the training and trest data.\n",
    "    - In a Markdown cell, document your observations from your results. (e.g. How did the RNN compare to your ML model? Was it superior to your ML model in some way (e.g. accuracy, recall, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save your best RNN model and Tensforflow Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save your best neural network in a subfolder inside your `\"Models/nn/` folder. (e.g. \"Models/nn/lstm/\")\n",
    "    - Reminder: use safe_format='tf' to save the model in a folder of repo-friendly files. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Save your training and test Tensorflow dataset objects in \"Data/nn/\":\n",
    "    - Save your training dataset object as `\"Data-NLP/nn/train/\"`\n",
    "    - Save your test dataset object  as `\"Data-NLP/nn/test/\"`\"\n",
