Craig Zahler, Bone Tomahawk stars Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins and Lili Simmons. Music is by Zahler and Jeff Herriott and cinematography by Benji Bakshi.\r\n\r\nAh, yes, the horror western hybrid, a most difficult thing to get right at the best of times, even harder to entice newcomers to the sub-genre splice if they don't particularly like horror or westerns! This is a tough sell, a pic of startling originality, but of homage worthiness as well, that it kind of feels like a film made for a secret society of film fans. A society perhaps like the Troglodyte tribe who dominate the horror aspect of this particular tale.\r\n\r\nPlot is set in the wild west, where after a set of circumstances leads to the kidnapping of three people from the local jail - by members of the Troglodyte tribe, four men set off on a rescue mission...\r\n\r\nHow splendid to find a narrative that isn't afraid to nod towards one of the most revered westerns of all time, yet be its own entity at the same time. Bone Tomahawk will polarise opinions, no question about it, the whole middle section involves a travelogue pumped by characterisations and a need to set the stage for what will occur in the final third. However, to even think that the four horsemen of the apocalypse bulk of this movie is mere slow time cinema is unfair, for dark comedy is at work - a racist horse? Surely not?. \r\n\r\nSo the screenplay not only sparkles with wit, but it also pulses with drama, drama that comes from human stubbornness. Be it men who know that no matter what will happen, they will maybe die in honour due to mistakes or mismanagement, or just a matter of redemption, this mission on the surface seems pure folly, but in reality there is more at work here. And thus comes the horror, characters have been well formed, we know them and are interested in what will happen to them. Like or dislike is irrelevant, we bloody know them, so as the film hits its raging \"B\" movie straps, shouting at the screen or wincing in harmony becomes a requisite. As is squirming...\r\n\r\nIntricately paced, beautifully photographed and splendidly performed by a top cast who aren't interested in top billing or walk of fame recognition, Bone Tomahawk is a grade \"A\" culter. Zahler could be someone to keep an eye on. 9/10", "**The flea, the flay and an offspring.**\r\n\r\nIt's shocking to find how much this film was underrated. Certainly it is not a fairytale like from the Disney production. That mean not for the children, but for the adults. Based on the collections of tales by some 17th century Italian poet. All the tales blended together so well, You won't even feel the familiarity with the original tale, because the modifications were at its best. So I appreciate the writer first, and then the director, followed by the actors.\r\n\r\nSince the film has a multiple story narrative layer, like three, the opening and the ending was common to all. But soon after the initiative, the tales go separate ways with its own twists and turns and conclusion, till again falling back in the line to finish it off the film. First a royal couple tend to do anything to have their own child. After many years, having no luck with the pregnancy, they now follow the instruction given by a necromancer. The result is most certain, but not without a negative effect.\r\n\r\nThe desperate couple sacrifices greater to have a child. The remaining story takes place in the few years later where a royal born child and his mother have differences. A fresh complication arises that puts the mother again in a tight spot. How it is going to be solved narrated in the following parts.\r\n\r\nIn the second story, the king of a hill castle is obsessed with his new insect pet. That leads him to neglect his own daughter who is dreaming of getting married and have a great life. But the things are not going well between father and daughter with her mother's absence. When the king comes to realise that, he comes with an agenda to achieve two things in one shot. That does not please his daughter, and soon she ends up in the hands of an ogre. The remaining is to tell us what happens to her in a thrilling way.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a father's responsibility. If his wife was alive, their daughter would have been taken care at best. Compared to the others, this tale gets more exciting and edgy, even the locations. Of course they have used blue/green screens, but still beautiful like the one from the top of the castle scene. I liked the casting for this, particularly the princess part.\r\n\r\n> \"The equilibrium of the world must be maintained.\"\r\n\r\nThe third tale is about a lustful king. One day when he hears a woman singing in a beautiful voice, the next minutes he lands on her home's front door, not knowing the woman is aged and has the wrinkle skin. But she and her sisters play along hiding behind the door and asks for a favour in order to win them back, I mean one of them. So how the rest of the story develops and who gets what, followed by a twist, it comes to an end.\r\n\r\nIt is a spectacular film. But not visually as the fairy tales told in the present Hollywood films. Particularly, it minimised the computer related special effects. So it was more realistic, yet you will get that fantasy feel with how the tales shape up. It's a black comedy, and that's an absolutely well done part. You know designing the dark humours are not an easy task and this film has three layers, though not all of them has them. The conclusions were so perfect, reminds us the happy and sad are the parts of our life.\r\n\r\nOver two hours long film, there's no drag in the narration. The length is because of the three tales and each one was narrated with a pretty good pace. But still it gives the impression the film is slow and that's for being silent like less background score in the most of the parts. From Salma Hayek to Toby Jones, Vincent Cassel, all were so good. The casting was the advantage for the film to shape up well. Since it is an international project, that will help the global audience to their comfort.\r\n\r\nThe director's first English language film and I think I'm going to keep an eye on his future projects. Certainly I have not seen such film like this, not in the todays cinema. The film was like in the old days. It does not deliver a couple of quick jokes and/or breathtaking visual effects, but the depth of the tale was good. The writers, director did not hesitate to add extra minutes to get what they wanted. I would have liked it if another layer of the tale was included and extended for another 30 or more minutes. For the grown ups, I suggest it not to miss, you won' get a film like this often.\r\n\r\n_8/10_", "This movie was terrible; obviously up-rated by interested parties - boring & suspenseful.", "Pointless and terrible film that leads to nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe Director of Fish Tank, was not able to capture lighting in a bottle twice.\r\n\r\nMost of the movie is spent in a van listening to rap music, the other large part is the boring romance story with a protagonist who seemed better to be a prostitute, then a door to door salesperson.\r\n\r\nOther characters are introduced but no depth is added to these characters, even though we spend a lot of time in a van with them.\r\n\r\nThe movie doesnt even pay off with the Conclusion it seemingly leads too, it just ends.", "Terrifier is a gory movie with a sadistic killer clown that revels in mutilating his victims in creative ways and willing to use any kind of improvised weapon as well as one not often seen in slasher movies. The movie makes effective use of practical effects and the gory murders are graphic enough to make you know this movie means business. David Howard Thornton stars as Art the Clown and his portrayal is devilishly effective as a villain who is mute and must use facial gestures to express himself in his ghoulish clown makeup. The story is the usual cat and mouse variety but this film is more about watching Art capture, torture and mutilate his victims. Terrifier is an effective and bloody slasher film that follows the usual formula of 1980's horror films and has crowned Art the Clown as one of the new faces of horror.", "_Terrifier_ had a lot of hype behind it with its very successful sequel hitting theaters this month, and unfortunately it did not translate to a pleasurable viewing experience. Before I jump into my criticisms of the film, the on-screen quality of visuals and effects were top notch for a budget of a mere $25,000. It is amazing what this crew was able to do with their conditions and everyone involved should be proud. With that being said, the limited budget does not give excuses for a poor script, dialogue and performances. This movie had a tremendous amount of cringe with perverted dialogue that seemed as if a middle schooler wrote it. The performances were campy, but not in a good way. In classic horror films the camp has a sense of nostalgia and a sign of the times but with this modern film with kills and elements that are taking themselves somewhat seriously, it just comes off as bad. The actor behind Art did do a fantastic job though. His portrayal of a mute killer who communicates to his victims with mimes and clown tricks was funny and chilling at the same time. The plot on its face did not have much depth to it. It boiled down to people in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was no added depth or lore to why these events were happening, although I did enjoy how each character who was tragically murdered had a connection the plot and were not just some random people introduced and killed in a single scene just to pad the kill count. As horror film, this movie failed to add any stakes or tension. The director leaned more into the gore which can be unsettling to look at but never made me feel uneasy. There was no build up to any of the kills, these classic horror elements made the movie seem extremely bland. Overall, I think this film is a marvel from a technical perspective based on its low budget, but when judging it from a film perspective it left me bored and waiting for the credits.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _33%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Bad_", "This film picks up where \"Chariots of Fire\" (1981) leaves off with the Olympic champion Eric Liddell (Joseph Fiennes) now a missionary in the land of his birth - now war-torn - China. When the Japanese invade, he is initially f\u00eated - well fed and looked after, but that is all part of the ultimate game of humiliation as he is basically being groomed for a race against \"Xu Niu\" (Shawn Dou). This is quite an interesting depiction of just how this man's Christian faith and sense of decency were pitched against the ruthlessness of his captors who used both physical and psychological methods to reduce their captives to jelly. Whilst this certainly hints at those atrocities, the whole look and feel of the film is just a little sterile and Fiennes isn't really up to much in the lead. Somehow his strength of faith and purpose is lost in a really mediocre production that never quite gets going properly. Based in fact, it does offer us a truth about the truly shameful ending for this man of principle, but perhaps a remake with a better cast, writing and more vision from a director who understands how to better deliver a story of a complex individual would leave us feeling better fulfilled. Watchable, but forgettable I am afraid.", "**It's not just about survival...**\r\n\r\nThe title says it all. Then I read its synopsis and right away I knew how much should I expect from it. Because this might be a fresh attempt in the Korean film, at least for the first time I'm seeing in a Korean film, but not from the world cinema. Yeah, I have seen plenty, and I'd liked most of them. But this film was much, much better than it had been rated in the internet. The story, the main event starts without wasting any time. There's no initial developments like intros. When the thriller-adventure parts commences, reveals everything you have to know.\r\n\r\nJust over 2 hours long, the story frequently switches back and forth to where a man got trapped in a collapsed tunnel road and the outside where people and rescue team gathered. Like any other similar themed film, it borrowed a handful of clich\u00e9s, but still you can witness the effort for the avoidance. Like if you see something or someone's crucial part come into play, usually you would predict what might happen to it in the later part of the story. Since those are unavoidable, they simply skipped in the final act as it is understandable and not to waste developing them to some extent.\r\n\r\nSo a man is fighting for his survival after a disaster strikes. But he got a cell phone signal buried under a deep mountain that I could not get. Anyway, he does make know his state of condition to the outside world. Soon they all rally to get him out. This film is not entirely a serious episode, despite the theme was. A little bit of satire. If that's how the film was intended or not, at least I had a couple of good laughs. Kind of reminded me 'Peepli (Live)', about the media circus in such situation. But that is the truth, what todays media have become, because of competition among themselves.\r\n\r\n> \u275dDon't be weak and say you'll die, just live.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe trapped man has to make sure about food and water to survive till the rescue team reaches him down which could take a week or more. Yeah, they kind of mention the recent Chile event which was made into the film, 'The 33'. His portion of the story is like the combination of '127 Hours', 'Buried' and of course that Chilean film. There are lots of things happen, you could say twists and turns. Kind of too much at some point, the way they added more contents to it, but decently it all worked out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the outside world, not lags behind. It has its own set of characters and its circumstance events. Lots of fun and also highlights wrongs. Particularly like I said, the media and how politicians make use of such incident for publicity. And the final one about the construction firms and their shoddy works for profits. They have dug on these topics, but did not go deeper, because to keep it lighter and entertaining film than all about awareness.\r\n\r\nAll the way an engaging narrative. Means a long film, but very swiftly told story. Visually, it was a well made film, like everything's looked natural and believable. You could not differentiate the CGI/green screen work and the real objects of those disaster parts. But not the technical details such as drilling or the hollow space where he stays alive. When the narration progresses, it gets even worse, like you would say how could that even possible or just they wanted it that way to end the tale.\r\n\r\nA small part of the end kind of skips, but that's good for the film than dragging it for another half an hour. The casting was good, they all performed well, but my favourite was Oh Dal-su. As usual, I loved his part, one of the finest supporting characters in the world cinema. It's not a great film, but good, and acceptable as what it is. In the end feels like worth it. So I decided to suggest it for those who are interested, but could not decide whether to go for it or not, and for the Korean film fans outside the Korea.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_", "**They're trying to bring back the series!**\r\n\r\nSo the Amityville series continues. What this is like overall a tenth film. The last one was a decade ago. I'm okay with their idea of bringing it up. But there's nothing new in it. Only it was a different cast and timeline. So basically, you probably have seen this story in other flicks.\r\n\r\nA family of a single mother with one child with a serious medical condition moves into the most popular haunted house, the Amityville. The other one, a teen girl discovers the rumours from her new schoolmates. But the mother won't heed to it, till unusual events begin to unfold. So how it all ends are the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nThe cast was good, and that's it, the film was average. If you are a big fan of horror, then this would be even a worse film, because you might have seen hundreds of similar flicks. I think Amityville franchise is dead, because of bad storied films. Otherwise with good filmmakers, particularly the writer, it could come back to the old glory. So now, it's not that worth. I would suggest to check it out other horrors released in this year.\r\n\r\n_5/10_", "Weak entry to an already played out franchise.

For reasons not worth recounting, Lee\u2019s wife Leslie (Erika Christensen) decides to accept Christ into her heart; the atheist Lee reacts to the news as if she\u2019d just confessed having a lover (indeed, at one point he even accuses her of \u201ccheating on him with Jesus\u201d).  \r\n\r\nFollowing his mentor's advice, Lee sets out to prove that the Resurrection never happened and thereby discredit Christianity. The rest of the film is an illustration that for those who believe in God, no explanation is necessary, and for those who do not believe, no explanation is possible. I would add that for those watching The Case for Christ, no explanation is provided. \r\n\r\nIn essence, the titular case for Christ is made up of a mixture of ipse dixit, proof by assertion, ad hoc hypothesis, and cherry picking. At no time does Strobel question any of this, and the reason is simple: if he did, the entire house of cards would fall faster than Kabul to the Taliban. \u201cWhen is enough evidence enough evidence?\u201d someone asks Strobel; the answer, which the film conveniently evades, is: when it comes to anecdotal evidence, never. \r\n\r\nWorst of all, the real-life Strobel's beliefs are as inconsistent and questionable as his journalism; he is so secretly ashamed of his conversion that, in addition to this film and the book on which it is based, there is a documentary, all with the sole purpose of publicly justifying his decision, which after all is absolutely nobody's business but his own.  \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s safe to conclude that just as Strobel blatantly lies to his audience, so does he lies to himself (unless his so-called faith is nothing more than a scam to relieve fools of their money, which seems more likely than anything else).", "WHO IS THIS FOR?\r\n\r\n_Batman and Harley Quinn_ isn't just tonally inconsistent from act to act, it's tonally inconsistent from **second to second**.

The movie treats Samson as if he was an Israelite version of Hercules (which he may have very well been); sadly, the only Hercules director Bruce Macdonald seems to knows of is Kevin Sorbo's in The Legendary Journeys \u2014 to the point of giving him his own Iolaus (though Iolaus at least had an equivalent in Greek mythology).\r\n\r\nThe year is \"1170 BC\" in \"ancient Israel\". I think the date alone would be enough to clue us in that we\u2019re not in 'modern' Israel; on the other hand, considering that the establishing shot of \u201cIsrael\u201d is a computer-generated image, perhaps the clarification is not as useless as it seems.\r\n\r\nWe meet Samson (Taylor James) and his heretofore unheard of younger brother Caleb (Greg Kriek) stealing corn; caught in the act, they both flee from Philistine soldiers who, for some reason, stop chasing them once Samson and Caleb pass through the city gates \u2014 unfortunately, the film fails to have a Philistine soldier tell another: \u201cForget it, Jacob. It's Chinatown\" (not as far-fetched as you may think; later there will be a direct reference to the Avengers\u2019 Hulk).\r\n\r\n\u201cWhispers of a Hebrew with great strength\u201d reach the ears of the Philistine prince Rallah (Jackson Rathbone); he doesn't take them too seriously, but his father, King Balek (Billy Zane), orders him to investigate further, something Rallah does with no little reluctance (to paraphrase Iznogoud, Rallah wants to be King in place of the King). Rallah, listen to your friend Billy Zane, he\u2019s a cool dude.\r\n\r\nRallah recruits a Philistine giant (who calls the God of the Hebrews a \u201cpuny god\u201d) to defeat Samson; Samson gets his ass handed to him at first, but when the Lord fills him with His spirit, Samson hulks up (that\u2019s a reference to the other Hulk, mind you) and soon has the giant saying 'no m\u00e1s, no m\u00e1s'. \r\n\r\nFrom here on out the plot sticks more or less faithfully to the biblical account, with a small but peculiar departure wherein Samson has to be tricked into visiting a brothel; the Book of Judges says begs to differ, though: \"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, Samson is anointed Judge and travels to the Philistine capital to negotiate peace with Balek; his conditions are \u201creduce the tribute, return the harvest that is rightfully ours [or else] you will face the wrath of God.\u201d \r\n\r\nIn the film\u2019s best line, Zane replies, with all the considerable sarcasm he can muster, \"So you threaten me with natural phenomena, freakish acts, and the weather.\" Ha! In your face Samson! It almost makes me forget that Balek and Rallah are just as imaginary as Caleb-Iolaus \u2014 not that Samson or Delilah are historical figures, but almost; their story is so well known that you don't have to know your Bible to realize that this Samson is as much a caricature as the Simpsons' version of David and Goliath.", "This film knocked my socks off, since it was exactly the kind of hard science-fiction that I often read as a young man.

The airborne spores can be seen, and we are shown their deadly effect; most of the action takes place while wearing the suits which filter out those deadly spores. This film impressed me mostly for its realism; the suits were well-worn, the spacecraft were also, and much of their equipment had to be jury-rigged to be useful. \r\n\r\nThe actors did a great job; Cee (Sopie Thatcher) was a natural, and totally believable, and had good chemistry with Ezra (Pedro Pascal) who really carried the movie; he sometimes reminded me of Nathan Fillian in Firefly.

The most significant balloon flight depicted here is based on the September 5, 1862 flight of British balloonists James Glaisher and Henry Coxwell. \r\n\r\nHowever, while Glaisher appears in the film (played by Eddie Redmayne, who looks like he landed on his face after his own parachute failed to open), Coxwell has been replaced by Amelia (Felicity Jones), a purely fictional character.\r\n\r\nThe lesson seems to be that it's not enough to discredit a real person simply because they belong to the male persuasion, but on top of that they have to 'empower' a unnecessary character that the filmmakers have dreamed up because they can't be bothered to research the subject their film is supposed to be about \u2014 if they had, they would know that the history of aeronautics is not short on women; for example, Katharina Paulus, who invented the first collapsible parachute (and didn\u2019t endangered a dog\u2019s life in the process, I\u2019m sure).", "Well, I like Jones and I like Redmayne so I had high hopes for this, plus it was based on true events... and I understood that it was going to be exaggerated for dramatic effect, but I didn't think it was going to be a total rewrite of history.\r\n\r\nI don't mind taking artistic licenses when making movies based on historical events... but I had no idea that Henry Coxwell was a woman named Amelia Rennes and I didn't know that she was the only one capable of doing anything of value on the flight.\r\n\r\nBut, I guess politics got in the way of history, and they decided that a total rewrite to the point where it was based around a fictional character needed to be done because the truth had too much meh patriarchy? Because they couldn't depict men as being intelligent or daring in any way?\r\n\r\nThey went woke, and filled it with trope of the new woke fad.\r\n\r\nSo, Jones doesn't really struggle, she never makes a mistake, she is always more intelligent, stronger, and braver than anyone else around her, while everyone else around her is a bumbling fool that only succeeds because of her capabilities.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, her character is entirely fictional.\r\n\r\nBut, it's a success if you want to entirely rewrite history to suit a political agenda.", "Honestly as much as there were some cringy moments, mainly bad dubbing, and poor acting from the likes of Schwarzenegger and to an extent Chan, I can't say I was bored mainly for how bizarre the movie was at times.

What on Earth are they doing in this dross? Indeed, though to a lesser extent, could that question be posed at rent-a-stars Charles Dance and Rutger Hauer. The story, not that it remotely matters, centres around Flemyng's \"Jonathan Green\" - a map maker charged with charting the Russian Far East. After a few rather limply devised and overly choreographed adventures, he ends up in China facing the almost comically un-menacing \"Dragon Master\" (Chan) whilst the deposed Czar of all the Russias (complete with the eponymous mask) escapes imprisonment in London and a battle royal looms... It's trying, to be fair. It mixes the mystic with the scientific; it even has a go at being witty now and again, but the sum of the parts is nowhere near good enough at the end. It lumbers along for almost two hours with a largely pedestrian dialogue and a sort of portmanteau style of delivery that smacks of a student assemble-edit.

As such, their whirlwind romance didn't resonate and the surfeit of coincidences left me expecting an imminent lottery jackpot.

Not even close. Matter of fact, it might be the exact opposite. The only films which I find hard to write a review on are those who don\u2019t have a single aspect that is either outstanding or horrible. Those who are so \u201cin the middle\u201d that you forget about them less than 24h after you\u2019ve seen it. 47 Meters Down: Uncaged could very well be this type of flick, but its ludicrous logical issues story-wise are impossible to ignore. Even the title is just a marketing scheme to attract people who liked the 2017\u2019s original since it is entirely unrelated to it (the water depth at which the characters are is never addressed).\r\n\r\nThis is one of the worst movies of the year. It still doesn\u2019t beat Serenity, but it made me rethink about the latter\u2019s grade because I find it so incredibly difficult to acknowledge one single good thing about this terrible sequel. Had I scored Matthew McConaughey\u2019s film an F, this one would probably belong there as well. However, in the same way that a film without flaws isn\u2019t necessarily an A+, a movie with no redeeming quality isn\u2019t instantly an F. If there\u2019s one compliment I can give Uncaged is that there are two or three short sequences where a jump scare is effective, or the suspenseful vibe was accomplished \u2026 Nevertheless, these are still just a couple of minutes in an almost 90-min runtime.\r\n\r\nThe characters have no development whatsoever. The story follows the most pathetic path possible. The sharks (which are the reason people actually went to the theater) are not as visually realistic as in the original, reaching a point where the CGI was pretty awful. A fish screams \u2026 I mean, really?! Who the hell supervised this mess? Characters talk underwater seamlessly with no explanation on how they are effectively talking. I could sit here and write dozens of questions that defy the film\u2019s logic, but I\u2019ll stop here. Not because I don\u2019t want to (if this wasn\u2019t a spoiler-free review, I\u2019d go crazy), but due to the fact that the main issue with the movie isn\u2019t the atrociously illogical plot points, but the lack of entertainment.\r\n\r\nFast and Furious, Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers \u2026 All of these are (financially) successful franchises. Audiences all over the world fill theaters and enjoy these series for what they are: popcorn entertainment. No one goes for the complex plots or layered characters. People go for the action, the explosions, the epic scores, the visual effects, and all of that stuff. Uncaged doesn\u2019t have any of that to compensate its other problems. One or two scenes here and there aren\u2019t enough to warrant the price of admission. Even the acting is mediocre. \r\n\r\nAll in all, 47 Meters Down: Uncaged is nothing more than a silly attempt at the start of a new franchise. Don\u2019t be fooled by its title since it has nothing to do with the original flick. It doesn\u2019t try to introduce compelling characters, the shark sequences fall flat for the most part, and the screenplay is filled with laughable plot points. There\u2019s no sense of logic. For an 89-minute runtime, it astounds me how it can\u2019t be slightly entertaining, to say the least. Undoubtedly, one of the worst films of the year. Skip it, so they don\u2019t have enough money to try and do a third one. Who knows?!

Initially they are isolated in the ruins of an underwater temple, then a beautiful lagoon that is nigh on impossible for them to escape from, then finally the open sea where a visiting tourist boat is pounding the blue waters with shark-tempting chum - and yet, yes - you've guessed...

I love how the aspect ratio changes whenever the mood changes in terms of tone. There\u2019s some impressive and effective use of camera work through out, but the scenes that stood out for me was every time someone drives, the camera will spin clockwise at the front - which reminded me of \u2018It Follows\u2019 clockwork-like spin. There was also some free flowing camera work that also reminded me of Terrence Malick movies.\r\n\r\nThe performances and characters were all fantastic. Sterling K. Brown delivers a fantastic performance as a strict and yet flawed father who\u2019s method of parenting is incredibly demanding. He has a son and a daughter, but in the first half we only see him hang around with his son and sculpt him to be the very best, while not realizing his putting the weight of the world on his sons shoulders. We barely see him with his daughter and when we do there\u2019s a sense of regret on his face, as if the painful realization is killing him.\r\n\r\nNewcomer Taylor Russell truly shines as the heart of the family, which you later find out was from her perspective this entire time. Alexa Demie, Kelin Harrison Jr., and Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry are all terrific, but most effectively was the characters portrayal that was both dynamic and soul crushing. Lucas Hedges is perfectly cast as a sweet young man with one of the kindest smile you could\u2019ve imagined; warm and welcoming.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of music from Frank Ocean and Radiohead, but it's something that the characters would listen to rather than the directors own playlist.

I don\u2019t know why, but this entire movie reminded me of \u2018Moonlight\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe best complement I can give to this movie is how unpredictable it is, because I had no idea where it was going. Putting aside that I went into this knowing nothing, but that wasn\u2019t the reason. It's a long movie, but I was invested the whole time. What took me by surprise is how the movie is structured and how every act unfolds a new chapter. The first act was a rush of energy in terms of pace, but the second act is almost a different movie and feels almost mystical.

By his own admission, Shults modelled his film on the two-part structure of Frank Ocean's 'Blonde', an album which is featured prominently in the film.

No, I'm not going to ease you in. I literally spent ninety minutes of my weekend feeling frustrated, angry, stressed out, and genuinely annoyed at how many aspects Force of Nature is horrible at. This is an atrocious film in every imaginable way. There's no redeeming quality or a little tiny positive note. I'm going to be as straightforward as I can. I'm not going to waste the usual time I need to write a review, this one will be written in less than fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the narrative. This movie is about a group of thieves that attempt to steal something from a building during a storm. It's a Category 5 hurricane, and all the film shows is rain. There are no windows breaking, doors flying, or any sort of indication that the weather is dangerous in any way. Every single character is plainly stupid. There's no way of describing them more accurately. Everyone makes astonishingly dumb decisions, based on the most illogical and unrealistic scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe action lacks everything it must have: energy, choreography, good editing, and everything else you can think of. A character dies, the camera goes in for a close-up, and the eyes are still freaking moving. That's the level of amateurism Force of Nature displays. The sound design comes from the past century, with punches, kicks, and gunshots sounding like I'm watching an anime. The editing is terrible throughout, but it's far from grabbing the spotlight with so many baffling stuff.\r\n\r\nEven the cast delivers laughable performances. Emile Hirsch (Cardillo) has the worst emotional range I've ever seen in an actor. His expressions are cringe-worthy in almost every single situation, independently of how serious the latter is or not. I have no idea what Mel Gibson (Ray) is doing in such a wretched flick. The \"plot armor\" that protagonists regularly possess is taken to a whole new level. Usually, they survive a 99%-chance of dying scenario, and the audience simply accept it. But the \"bad guys\" in this movie are ridiculously portrayed, almost like the actors are interpreting caricatures of their characters.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole film, I felt continuously frustrated. Every single minute is packed with story inconsistencies and truly irritating characters. I've never felt so uncomfortable watching a movie before. I never wished so hard for a film to finally end. I was moving around on my couch and giving these nervous chuckles because I was honestly feeling extremely annoyed at what I was watching. Michael Polish and Cory Miller should be ashamed of what they did. This is an embarrassment for any filmmaker. Believe me: I could easily write 2000+ words about this piece...\r\n\r\nForce of Nature is indeed a force to be reckoned with... for the \"Worst Movies I've Ever Seen\" contest. From the baffling character decisions to the illogically absurd narrative, Michael Polish directs an appalling film packed with excruciatingly embarrassing acting, horribly dated sound design, a nonsensical attempt at creating a catastrophic atmosphere, awful editing, impressively lousy action, and last but not least, one of the worst screenplays ever put to screen, by Cory Miller. The level of amateurism is genuinely jaw-dropping. I've never felt so uncomfortable watching a heist movie. I'm feeling incredibly frustrated, bitter, annoyed, and unsure how a film like this was made possible. Please, stay away from this abomination. Even if you're interested in watching it just to know how bad it actually is, be careful. Because you're not going to feel that well after watching Mel Gibson fall to this level.\r\n\r\nRating: F", "From Mel Gibson's worst fake smokers cough I have ever heard to every line delivered by Emile Hirsch making me cringe, this is one of the worst action/crime films I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through.

Seriously, I didn't know a mainstream film with this many stars could be this bad. \r\n\r\nTrust my review: don't waste your time on this. You will regret it.", "I vaguely recall a news story some years ago about the discovery of an whole load of old masters in the room of a gent who had hoarded them after the end off WWII. Maybe that is what inspired this otherwise shockingly weak and far-fetched detective thriller. The cringingly poor Emile Hirsch (\"Cardillo\") is posted to Puerto Rico after a fatal accident killed his cop-girlfriend. It is here, teamed up with \"Jess\" (Stephanie Cayo) that they become embroiled in a heist, in the midst of an hurricane, that sees them held hostage by some ruthless robbers in search of a room full of art in an ordinary residential block. Luckily, though, retired officer \"Ray\" (Mel Gibson) is on hand to help them survive. What Gibson is doing in this is anyone's guess. It is a poorly paced, shockingly derivative affair that has all the hallmarks of a college project, just with a bit more cash. The dialogue is puerile and lacks style or humour, indeed the whole thing just lacks...

I enjoyed it like any other kid who enjoys almost everything, but it was never a show that made me nervously excited during the day, waiting for it to come on TV. I vividly remember getting pumped, knowing that a new episode of Dragon Ball Z or Timon & Pumba would broadcast on that particular day. I never felt that way with Scooby-Doo, and honestly, I don't know why. I was always curious about sci-fi and \"what lies beyond\", so maybe the fact that the goal of the show was to justify every single paranormal activity with some \"guy in a mask\" didn't really appeal to the kid in me...\r\n\r\nEither way, I still liked the series, and my memory is filled with all of the show's classic signatures: the (double or even triple) un-masking of the villains, Scooby jumping to Shaggy's arms because they both got scared, the ridiculously large sandwiches, you name it. Ironically, the biggest compliment I can give the film also relates to its major flaw. For any fan of the show, these classic moments will provide high levels of nostalgia and entertainment, so anyone who comes looking for that will definitely get what they desire.\r\n\r\nHowever, even though Scoob! is far from feeling like a corporate flick packed with product placement (looking at you, Sonic the Hedgehog), I can't help but feel that the studio was embarrassed by its own property. They try so hard to make this movie belong to 2020 that they completely forgot about what makes the show special for so many people. From the weirdly confusing song selection to the way too modern plot points, Scoob! 's narrative distinctly follows an Avengers-style plot (including an obvious allusion to Captain America holding his shield) focusing strongly on the superhero theme.\r\n\r\nThey didn't believe that Mystery Inc. and the (successful) formulaic story were enough to hold the target audience's attention, so they decided to borrow from one of the most entertaining and financially impactful genres of today, losing the essence of their own IP. Therefore, despite Scoob! having almost all of the cartoon's classic scenes, it still feels detached from the source material. In addition to this, if you're not a fan of Scooby-Doo and if you don't know anything about it, then don't expect this film to explain anything to you.\r\n\r\nFred, Velma, and Daphne get separated from Shaggy and Scooby early on (due to a hilariously dumb scene that only kids will accept), so almost no character development occurs within the first group of people. This movie focuses more on the pair's adventure and their relationship dynamics (which are explored in a cliche yet efficient manner), leaving 3/5 of the Mystery Inc. feeling left off. Actually, now that I think about it, Scoob! doesn't even have a mystery to solve!\r\n\r\nIn the cartoons, every episode is about discovering what or who's causing a specific paranormal event. This film basically follows that formula for the first fifteen minutes (which serve as an origin story of the gang) and then takes an entirely different path story-wise. I'm not going to complain about the plot's absurdity because it's undeniably a kids' movie, but these forced attempts to adapt Scooby-Doo to 2020 are what ruin the whole thing for me. The voice acting is great, though, and hearing Frank Welker interpret Scooby again is incredibly joyful.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Scoob! possesses almost all of the classic moments from the original cartoon, which will surely leave fans of the series satisfied and feeling that heartwarming nostalgia. In addition to this, the voice work is really good for the most part, especially from the legend, Frank Welker as Scooby. However, the studio hurts the film with countless attempts to adapt the formulaic yet successful screenplay that the show employed for decades into 2020. From the superhero-like plot to the lack of a central mystery, Tony Cervone finds himself in a writing mess (four screenwriters and three \"story by\" credits) from a company ashamed of its own product. If you're a hardcore fan of the animated show, this movie might leave you satisfied. But if you don't share a special connection with these characters and their classic adventures, or if you don't know anything about this franchise at all, Scoob! not only doesn't care to introduce or develop its characters, but it definitely isn't going to convert you.\r\n\r\nRating: C-", "Never my favourites of cartoon characters, this sadly doesn't really do much better than the pretty far-fetched, slapstick, animation series from the 1970s. It starts off by way of an explanation as to how the young \"Shaggy\" and his eponymous canine pal initially hooked up, before jumping forwards to present day where the two, along with the rest of the \"Mystery Inc.\" gang, must work together to thwart an evil plan to unleash the legendary guardian of the Underworld - a spectral form of Cerberus - on mankind. To be fair, it doesn't hang around and the animation quality keeps the style fairly similar to the original television series; it's just that the writing is really lacklustre and cheesy with the characters - for me, at any rate - just downright irritating, playing to just about every stereotype imaginable. The reveals at the end were always pretty silly, and here is no different - it's all just too lightweight and disappointing. I'd have backed Cerberus any day. Perhaps it is just aiming for a nostalgic audience of adults who recall it more fondly than I do? In any case, I really cannot see this resonating with the kids today and maybe this is one cinema release that lockdown did us all favour by restricting.", "The Secret: Dare to Dream is based on a self-help book, which is turn based on a pseudocumentary. I have not read the book (nor will I ever), but judging from the movie, it must be a lot like Brian Griffin's Wish It, Want It, Do It \u2013 complete with the 50 blank pages.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the movie does is instruct me that there are two ways I can live my life; one is as if everything were a miracle, and the other as if nothing were. But if everything is a miracle, then nothing is a miracle; the very concept of 'miracle' would not exist. Let's put it this way: if everything were a miracle, then many of the things that Jesus does in the Bible would no longer be special.\r\n\r\nThe only gospel, however, that TS:DtD preaches is the New Age Gospel. God's name is invoked only once (when Einstein is misquoted as saying that \"Coincidence is God's way of staying anonymous\"). The film revolves around the Law of Attraction, a pseudoscientific belief that positive or negative thoughts bring positive or negative experiences into a person's life.\r\n\r\nThe most curious thing about all this is that the movie stars Katie Holmes; this doesn't mean that she believes this nonsense, although it's no secret that she's not very picky when it comes to choosing belief systems; either way, I sincerely hope this is not what she left Scientology for.\r\n\r\nAccording to IMDb, \"Miranda (Katie Holmes) [is] a young widow trying to make ends meet while raising her three children and dating her boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell). A devastating storm brings an enormous challenge and a mysterious man, Bray (Josh Lucas), into Miranda's life. Bray reignites the family's spirit but, unbeknownst to Miranda, also holds an important secret - one that will change everything. With its timeless messages of hope, compassion, and gratitude, The Secret: Dare to Dream is an inspiring and heartwarming film that shows how positive thoughts can transform our lives.\"\r\n\r\nThe message is that if we think very hard we can all have a huge house, a pony, and a Mac computer. Of course there are caveats; sometimes you think of Matthew McConaughey and the best the Universe can come up with is Josh Lucas. And what about Tuck (O'Connell), Miranda's boyfriend \u2013 briefly fianc\u00e9 \u2013 whose engagement ring she returns, breaking his heart? Weren't his thoughts positive enough? Or maybe he just looks too much like Tom Cruise for her taste.", "Disappointment that it didn't live up to the first film.\r\nAt least first film was edgy, a little scary, even had goths.", "Sigh... not that I expected anything that equaled the original The Craft even partially, this is an insult to decades of pre-woke era American culture.\r\n\r\nSensitivity and tolerance notwithstanding, this is thematically and aesthetically a major step down from the original film and urinates all over the legacy of that classic contribution to American cinema.\r\n\r\nMost glaring from a visual standpoint is casting of the 4 leads, a double wide boy posing as a girl(!?), a girl who looks like a boy, a legitimately ugly girl, and (at least) a beautiful descendant of the kings and queens of Africa. Why, pray tell would they deviate from the original formulation of alluring and powerful imagery of 4 uniquely beautiful young women and give us THAT mess instead? Because beauty is more than skin deep? Because inner beauty is more important? Because everyone is beautiful? Not quite. Beauty is just beauty, and they decided to leave it out of this film for the most part.\r\n\r\nAdding to the insult of this present day lesson in how to wokefy the sequel of a classic film, they decided to make every masculine character, evil.

Boasting two phenomenal performances from Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott (Colin Tate), Possessor is one of the most visually shocking films of 2020.\r\n\r\nFrom the extreme gore to the unrestrained depiction of insanely violent murders, Cronenberg fills his movie with creepy imagery that will definitely trigger many viewers to simply give up. Its slow pace helps establish the never-ending suspenseful atmosphere, which ultimately delivers some of the most intense sequences I've seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nDespite the interesting narrative and its eye-opening developments, Possessor fails to keep the momentum going throughout the entire runtime. The weird imagery helps with visual storytelling, but it reaches a point where it becomes too distracting and unnecessary.

Blake Lively injured herself on set, consequently delaying the movie until the end of 2019, and then again to the well-known \"trash month\", so obviously, my expectations were quite low. It's the first time I watch a feature film directed by Reed Morano, as well as Mark Burnell, who makes his debut as a screenwriter. As usual, the only thing I knew about the movie was its synopsis and crew, but I also caught the overwhelmingly negative feedback from critics and audiences alike...\r\n\r\nWhile its flaws are undeniable (and I'll get there), I don't find Reed Morano's film to be worthy of belonging in January with so many worse movies. Sean Bobbitt's cinematography is a technical standout, by delivering two fantastic one-take action sequences (one of which is edited to feel like one take), and some wide shots look genuinely stunning. I always love when a film is set in actual cities or remote locations since these offer a realistic atmosphere, and given the right treatment in post-production, the tone can be better controlled by the environment surrounding the characters.\r\n\r\nThe cast is also really good. Blake Lively delivers one of the best performances of her career, definitely the most somber one. Her character is constantly placed in challenging situations, physically and emotionally. Blake incorporates Stephanie's state of mind seamlessly, carrying the narrative forward even when the latter fails to captivate the viewer. Jude Law is Jude Law, and Sterling K. Brown offers a notable display as well. However, the positives end here.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, The Rhythm Section lacks creativity and uniqueness. Besides being way too straightforward and predictable for an action-drama with a central mystery, it's edited (Joan Sobel) in such an uncommon manner that makes the movie feel incredibly tiresome. Tons of moments are drawn out for extra seconds or even minutes. Almost every scene weirdly goes on for far too long. There's no new information to transmit to the viewer, nothing is happening... The whole film is edited like this, consequently ending with almost fifteen/twenty minutes of nothing. Also, some dialogue scenes are intercut with something that's going to happen after that particular conversation, which is confusing in the sense that the viewer doesn't know where the focus is supposed to be on.\r\n\r\nThen, the actual narrative raises tons of logical questions. I hate to be \"that guy\" who nitpicks character decisions or plot points like CinemaSins (even though this channel makes so for comedy purposes), but this movie really makes the viewer wonder \"how/why the hell is she able to do this?!\" Stephanie is trained to be an agent, and while a specific part of her training is straight-up impossible, I believe that the character possesses the required skills. My issue is that she barely uses anything that she learned: she continuously runs away from everyone and everything and she gets other innocent people dead in her partially failed missions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her, there are other characters with either unclear motivations or questionable lifestyles, having in mind that this film deals with secret intelligence, terrorism, and stuff that very few people have access to or knowledge of. The score also feels extremely awkward. Similar to the editing issue, the song selection doesn't fit the dark, depressing tone that the movie carries. Sometimes, Stephanie is about to go on a serious mission, and upbeat pop music is playing... Why?\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Rhythm Section isn't as awful as most January films, it certainly doesn't deserve the record of the worst opening weekend of all-time, but it still carries tons of issues. The editing (Joan Sobel) is weirdly unconventional, drawing out scenes for extra seconds or even minutes where absolutely nothing happens and intercutting dialogue sequences with unnecessary flashbacks or flashforwards. Reed Morano isn't able to bring creativity or anything remotely original to her movie, and Mark Burnell writes a predictable screenplay packed with questionable plot points and logical issues, not helping the already dull pacing. Steve Mazzaro's score doesn't fit the tone of the film, but Sean Bobbitt's cinematography delivers a couple of surprising action sequences and some neat wide shots. The cast is really good, and if not for an outstanding Blake Lively, this movie would have been a lot worse.\r\n\r\nRating: C-", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAneesh Chaganty's Searching was enough to add its debutant director-screenwriter to my list of \"filmmakers to follow closely\". Run solidifies Chaganty's place in Hollywood as one of the most technically impressive directors working today. His undeniable talent allows him to effortlessly generate incredible suspense throughout the movie's entire runtime, and his second feature-film is no exception.\r\n\r\nPossessing the type of premise I enjoy the most in thrillers, Chaganty and Sev Ohanian's screenplay is packed with excruciatingly long takes, filled with extremely tense dialogues, shocking developments, and a brutal amount of pain. All are enormously elevated by one of the most physically-demanding, emotionally powerful performances I've seen in the last few years: Kiera Allen, who uses a wheelchair for mobility in real-life, turns her acting debut into a genuine, realistic display of the challenging obstacles people with her condition have to overcome daily.\r\n\r\nSarah Paulson continues her trend of playing truly evil characters, and I advise her to keep following this dark path of phenomenal interpretations. Her interactions with Kiera are remarkably intense. Story-wise, even though the constant revelations are narratively shocking, most of the script's developments are somewhat predictable. However, the \"movie logic\" problems stretch believability to a point beyond my limit, ultimately becoming one of those films people will either deeply enjoy or really hate depending on how nitpicky they choose to be.\r\n\r\nI'm as moderate as I can be, and the truth is, I didn't really think about these logical issues during the actual viewing. Having in mind Run's brilliant technical attributes (notably Nick Johnson and Will Merrick's editing, and Torin Borrowdale's score), its two impressive lead performances, and its endless suspenseful atmosphere, I can't help but recommend it to every fan of the genre.\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "I watched a lot of movies and it had been a long time (over the pandemic year/s) since I have seen such a gripping thriller involving a family. In Run, a mother and a daughter's relationship starts to strain when the latter suspects her mother is doing ill on her. As you continue to guess what it might be, Run takes you by surprise. It delivers the goods and it keeps you hooked till the last second. Go, watch it already!", "If you doubt the need for another Austen, let this gorgeous film change your mind. Instead of ignoring the offers made to the period film genre by great films like 'Anna Karenina' and <a href=\u201c/article/review-the-favourite-a-delicious-work-of-magnificent-insanity\u201c>'The Favourite'</a>, 'Emma.' runs with them, finding a new language for approaching the great works of one of the great writers, realising her wit and humour in new and exciting ways while honouring the deep intelligence and generosity within them. I spent the entirety of Autumn de Wilde's wonderful film with the dumbest smile on my face, mixed with peals of laughter and gushing tears of joy. This is how we must approach the great classics - a celebration of what we love about them and an engagement with how they can speak to us here and now. That's how and why they can continue to matter so much.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-emma-a-dazzling-new-adaptation-of-jane-austens-classic", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nEmma. is Autumn de Wilde's feature film directorial debut, as well as Eleanor Catton's screenwriting debut. I never watched any previous adaptations and period movies aren't exactly \"my thing\". This doesn't mean I can't appreciate them! The Favourite and Little Women are the most recent examples of films belonging to said genre that I absolutely love. The main reason why I felt the need to watch this adaptation was Anya Taylor-Joy's first time as the sole protagonist.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe she'll become one of the greatest actresses of her generation, along Florence Pugh, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Hailee Steinfeld, Kaitlyn Dever, Saoirse Ronan, and a few others. Her performance in this movie is yet another argument to validate my prediction. She's phenomenal as Emma! It took me a while to get used to her voice since she applies a much higher tone than her usual one. Seeing actors doing different accents is pretty common, but changing their voice as Anya does, even if it's a simple modification, it still shows how committed she was to her role.\r\n\r\nAs cliche as it might sound, she carries the whole story on her shoulders. She's the link that connects all storylines and characters. Without her, the film doesn't work, so her display had to be near-perfect. Anya demonstrates her range and emotional ability, as well as a seamless control of the complex and rich script. Most dialogues possess long sentences with sophisticated vocabulary, something only the best actors can deal with effortlessly.\r\n\r\nAnya shines, but her character does too. Emma's arc is quite interesting. Besides being \"handsome, clever and rich\", she has no respect for the poor, manipulates her friend's romantic decisions, and sometimes acts in a very selfish, arrogant manner. Her transformation into a better person is the most captivating arc of the screenplay, but it also demonstrates my main issue with the movie as a whole. Ten minutes in, and I knew everything that was going to happen.\r\n\r\nNow, I always try to avoid thinking too much ahead. But when it comes to relationships between characters, it's all so predictable and obvious to me that I can't help but guess the whole story. The same screenplay trick is used throughout to twist certain relationships, becoming repetitive and a bit dull. I never felt truly invested in the film until the one-hour mark. It's mostly well-paced, but when nothing is surprising, innovative, or creative regarding the overall narrative, there's not that much that can keep me captivated.\r\n\r\nThe first act is a tad confusing, with too many characters getting introduced too fast. Honestly, I just discovered while writing this review that a secondary character is supposed to be blood-related to one of the main ones. Story and characters are the two pillars of any movie. I've always written this. If these two don't work, then everything else crumbles. It's far from collapsing, it's actually very well-structured, but it's like these two pillars are just like thousands of others. There's no distinct characteristic that makes these unique.\r\n\r\nWeirdly enough, I never felt bored. The cast really does a nice job of keeping me entertained by every remarkable performance. Bill Nighy (Mr. Woodhouse) and Miranda Hart (Miss Bates) are quite funny. The costume design is gorgeous besides being extremely important since it actually elevates the story by clearly identifying who's rich and poor. Production and set design are fantastic. Great cinematography (Christopher Blauvelt), and an enjoyable score (Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer). Nevertheless, as outstanding as the technical achievements might be, the film still lacks a unique directing style, which is normal, having in mind it's the director's first feature.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Emma. doesn't reach the latest period movies' level like The Favourite or Little Women, but it's a fine start for debutants director Autumn de Wilde and screenwriter Eleanor Catton. Anya Taylor-Joy delivers an exceptional performance as a very well-written Emma Woodhouse, carrying the film on her shoulders until the very end, cementing her place in Hollywood as one of the greatest actresses of her generation. The rest of the cast is also pretty great. The costume design steals the \"technical show\", but the production level in this movie is impressive. However, the narrative lacks surprising elements, making the existence of this new adaptation a bit questionable. Why make another film if there's nothing unique about it? Predictable from the get-go, confusing first act, and very hard to feel invested before the one-hour mark. If you enjoy period comedy-dramas, I recommend it. Otherwise, the two movies mentioned above are probably a better choice...\r\n\r\nRating: C+", "When I saw the previews for this latest interpretation of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, I envisioned a reimagining of the classic, with the plot or the setting radically changed with creative license applied liberally throughout. I was ready to not like it.\r\n\r\nBut instead I discovered that wondrous creativity was launched to make small tweaks to details. There was Harriet Smith, who may have been plain, but marching here and there with her classmates, dressed in matching red dresses and large hats, providing a very striking Image for the eye. There were the chorale music resonating at the end of scenes, leading to or melding into the beginning of the next scene. And Bill Nighy, who was suitably wary of illness and draughts, but had a spring in his step at times to juxtapose with his fearfully cautious nature.\r\n\r\nI thought Rupert Graves and Miranda Hart were imaginative choices for the roles of Mr. Weston and Miss Bates. And there is even an creative tweak to the one-word title, whereby a period is added after the name to indicate that the movie is - wait for it - a period piece.\r\n\r\nSo this is the third version of Emma in the past 25 years - two movies and a mini-series - and for now at least, it is my favorite.", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIf you've been following me for a while, you know I'm not the biggest fan of rom-coms. It's not that I don't like the genre (I appreciate and enjoy every single one), but I find its movies tremendously difficult to *really* love. The massive majority follow the genre's formulas and cliches to such an extent that I rarely end up truly loving one of these films. Some are way too cheesy. Others are way too unrealistic and dream-like. But the aspect that throws me off the most is the lack of originality. I can't remember the last rom-com I watched that didn't borrow from countless other installments. I didn't know a thing about Palm Springs: no trailers, no knowledge of critics/audience's opinion, nothing... And I'm extremely happy about that!\r\n\r\nI usually watch the main trailer for every film I review *after* I've seen the actual movie. I ignore all other trailers, clips, images, and so on. I do this so I can have some sort of knowledge regarding how far I can take my spoiler-free reviews. This way, I'm sure that I don't write about something I shouldn't. The official trailer for this film doesn't ruin the experience in any way, but it does tell its viewers the most relevant aspect of its screenplay. So, I could address it in this review, but I won't... because I enjoyed this movie a lot more, not knowing a thing about it than if I knew how it developed its story.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I'll keep it really vague, and just write that Andy Siara's first feature-film screenplay can easily snatch a couple of nominations when the awards season comes around. This is a rom-com like no other due to its refreshingly unique concept. It's true that it's not an entirely new method of storytelling. Many other movies also employ this idea, but Siara holds so many surprises within his narrative and so few of the genre's common traits that the whole film is elevated by his outstanding writing.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the most entertaining movies of the year. With a short runtime and a fast pace, Palm Springs is constantly being genuinely fun, engaging, and even mysteriously intriguing. Its original plot makes the viewer think and remember previous lines that take a whole different meaning a few minutes later. There are no predictably dumb narrative decisions, and its characters escape the cheesy and forced relationships that these films usually insert them in. The dialogues are hilariously captivating. Almost every single plot point packs an emotional punch, a jaw-dropping revelation that never crossed the viewer's mind.\r\n\r\nAndy Samberg and Cristin Milioti share such great chemistry. Their characters are exceptionally developed, and their relationship feels incredibly real. I'm rarely that viewer who requires the main characters to be together, kiss, fall in love, and all that, but Nyles and Sarah are two wonderful protagonists I can definitely root for. Both carry an interesting \"baggage\", which is also explored at a deep level. They deal very differently with the \"situation\" that the story puts them in, and it's so much fun to watch them go through it and evolve as characters. Oh, and J.K. Simmons (Roy)... this man doesn't know how not to be utterly remarkable!\r\n\r\nMax Barbakow (directorial debut) demonstrates his talents as well, by allowing Siara's screenplay to shine under impeccable direction. Tonally, it never loses its balance. It keeps its comedy pretty grounded, considering the craziness of its premise. It never relies on the genre's formulas, cliches, and cheesy outcomes. It really separates itself from the majority of modern rom-coms. I don't really have any flaws to point out... The ending does have a \"just accept it\" narrative component, and there are a couple of unnecessary scenes, but I'm nitpicking here.\r\n\r\nI can't believe I'm going to write this, but Palm Springs is not only one of the best rom-coms I've ever seen, but it's also one of the best (if not *the* best) movies of 2020, so far. With the help of their first-time director (Max Barbakow), Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti spread their extraordinary chemistry all over the innovative, original narrative, written by the also debutant, Andy Siara. The latter is undoubtedly the main responsible for such an entertaining film. Siara takes an imaginative concept and develops it in the most captivating, fun, hilarious, and even intriguing way possible. A surprising screenplay packed with emotionally impactful plot points, revelations, and twists that keep the enjoyment levels extremely high. The two protagonists are exceptionally developed, as well as their compelling relationship. With a fast pace and a perfect balance of its tone, Palm Springs sets itself apart from the other movies of the genre, staying away from all of the cliches, formulas, and stereotypes associated with it. J.K. Simmons also lends his awesomeness because why not? Whether you're a fan of rom-coms or not, I definitely suggest giving this one a look. You won't be disappointed!\r\n\r\nRating: A", "Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend, especially for fans of \"time shifting\" tropes.\r\n\r\nTime shifting is where your mind goes back in time, but not your body.  Essentially everything resets like a save point, except your have all this knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Time shifting\" was made popular by \"Groundhog's Day\" and there have been several movies that mainly consist of dying / sleeping and repeating like a video game, and this isn't THAT different with a few exceptions that make all the difference in the experience.\r\n\r\nAndy Samberg (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) finally steps up and shows everyone that he can do a somewhat serious role, and not just a straight man.  Cristin Milioti (How I Met Your Mother) does an excellent job in her lead role, with a great supporting cast, to include J.K. Simmons (Cave Johnson) leading a wonderful supporting cast, except for Tyler Hoechlin (CW Superman: \"Supergirl\", \"Flash\", etc.), who I might just not like because he was Superman, but it's supposed to be an disliked character...so....good job?\r\n\r\nThe medium of the transfer being shown is an interesting option as we saw in the \"Happy Death Day\" movies, but it does allow for a reasoning of how it works, can it be broken / manipulated as opposed to divine will.  Most importantly, it allows for more than just one subject being affected, which is really where it gets set apart.\r\n\r\nThe trope bleeds a little when you have multiple people trapped in the loop: you have multiple people trapped in a thing: you have multiple people trapped in a prison.  When multiple people are trapped in a environment together, they tend to get a little strange, and we get that sort of thing a plenty.  Because we have multiple story threads to follow, we're almost seeing 3 stories all overlapping, and the movie does a great job of showing those, whether or not their in chronological order, or happening at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhether you see it as a prison break movie, or a time loop movie, this movie has a lot of fun in it, along with deep metaphysical philosophy, so there is something for everyone.", "Palm Springs puts a new spin on the old time loop story, and I am surprised at how well it works. Andy Samberg is fantastic as ever and shows off a little more acting chops than I give him credit for with the more emotional scenes in the film. The chemistry that he and Christin Milloti share is spectacular and felt so incredibly genuine. I felt so many things during this movie ranging from happiness, sadness, and laughter, it really takes you for a ride and it is such a fantastic one at that. This is such an underrated film and I cannot recommend this enough.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_", "'I Still Believe' is just another forgettable romantic film, and thankfully it's also forgettable in the religious film genre. It has a tonne of issues from pacing to story, but it's just a boring film that is unappealing to all the demographics it tries to hit.

Dave Bautista is also the best he\u2019s ever been as far as his acting ability goes. Gory as hell and entertaining through and through, Army of the Dead is a must-watch for action and horror film fans alike.

He has a truly original vision, he makes films unlike anyone else, and he seems to relish being a bit of an outsider who somehow gets to make whatever he wants. Sort of like this generation's version of 90's/00's Robert Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nYet, try as I might I just can't seem to actually enjoy his films. I won't bother going into it because personally I'd prefer not enjoying a wacky Zach Snyder film then being mildly entertained by most mainstream fluff that seem crafted by algorithms. \r\n\r\nIf you like Snyder's films this one will most likely be a real joy. If you don't this one won't win you over. Either way, I hope he gets to keep making his manic fever dreams because we need more films with authentic voices.", "The only good thing about Zack Snyder's masturbatory exercise Army of the Dead, is that it's comparatively shorter than his version of Justice League \u2013 but what movie isn't? An hour and a half short of a four-hour movie is still too long, especially considering that if everything we've seen before were edited out of the film, AotD would be a short feature.\r\n\r\nTrue, we may not have seen a heist/zombie apocalypse movie, but we've seen dozens of heists and dozens of zombie apocalypses, and bringing the two genres together only serves to highlight the inconsistencies of each. But, let us start at the beginning. A US military convoy is transporting an unknown cargo from Area 51. The two soldiers in the cab of the truck debate the contents of the box (\u201cthe original draft of the Constitution written in the blood of the Founding Fathers\u2026 Amelia Earhart, long live \", etc.). Whatever it is, it\u2019s highly inflammable, judging by how the truck instantly turns into a huge ball of fire the moment it makes contact with a considerably smaller vehicle.\r\n\r\nActually it is some kind of superhuman zombie that kills a bunch of soldiers and infects two of them. This entire scenario could easily have unfolded without the arbitrary and random explosion; the gigantic fireball is here solely because Snyder is such an impatient director that, in a 140-minute film, he can't wait even five minutes before blowing something to bits \u2013 the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Snyder takes his time on plot points that we all know by heart. Hero is offered a job. Hero turns down job. Hero changes his mind and takes the job. Hero assembles team. And so on and so forth. So as to leave no clich\u00e9 unused, the hero also has an estranged daughter, Kate (Ella Purnell); this, however, deserves some more attention.\r\n\r\nKate works in a quarantine camp for zombies, which is nothing short of a logic-defying concept. It is first established that the zombie bite takes immediate effect, transforming the victim into another zombie \u2013 and one does not quarantine a zombie; one shoots a zombie in the head and moves on.\r\n\r\nNow, it has always been a habit of zombie movies to play fast and loose, depending on the requirements of the script, with the time it takes for a bite to kick in, but two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. All things considered, AotD is a rip-off that makes it a point of ripping off bad ideas \u2013 which might be all right if it were a parody, but the movie is too bloated and excessive to ever be able to take itself lightly.", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI know Sundance is one of those festivals that carry dozens of impressive, impactful films from writer-directors that really throw themselves into the art of filmmaking and storytelling. I anticipated being blown away by many movies that I knew nothing about or didn't recognize the crew and cast involved. I expected some films to emotionally impact me so much that I'd save them close to my heart until the very end of the year. With this said, I was unbelievably far from imagining that the very first viewing would be a heavy contender for my absolute favorite movie of the entire festival.\r\n\r\nCODA (Child Of Deaf Adults) is the first film I watch by Si\u00e2n Heder, and after this session, I can't wait to see what she did so far and what she's going to do in the future. The clearly interesting premise is developed through a much more emotional narrative than I expected. From rich visual storytelling to exceptional use of sign language, Heder is able to capture something unique and deeply important to transmit to the audience and to today's society. The world was fortunate enough to get Sound of Metal last year, and CODA reinforces the essential message that being deaf must not be seen as a massive disability or a brutal handicap.\r\n\r\nAs the movie cleverly communicates through its impeccable screenplay, having some sort of \"limitation\" doesn't automatically characterize someone as weird, different, or that the respective family members don't love each other as much or more than the so-called \"normal\" families. Except for a somewhat insignificant love relationship featuring the main character (that could have brought up an entirely different, unnecessary, and even distracting topic to the film's central, vital themes), I was incredibly invested in every single storyline.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I find every interaction within the deaf family much more compelling and captivating than any other dialogue in the movie, and this is mostly due to the amazing performances from the cast. Leaving the protagonist to the end, Daniel Durant (Leo Rossi, brother) and Marlee Matlin (Jackie Rossi, mother) are great as supporting characters, but Troy Kotsur (Frank Rossi, father) and Eugenio Derbez (Bernardo Villalobos, music teacher) literally left me in tears with their heartfelt displays. I could feel the outstanding commitment to their roles, and I'm delighted that Bernardo Villalobos isn't just another stereotypical, cliche, hysterical choir adult.\r\n\r\nHowever, the biggest praise in my bag must go to powerful glue that holds everything together, elevating the whole film to a whole other level: Emilia Jones as the only hearing member of the family, Ruby Rossi. First of all, I love music, and Pentatonix is actually my favorite group (acapella or not), so hearing so many wonderful voices singing together would always be a massive plus for CODA in my review. Nevertheless, not only Jones' voice is sumptuously heartwarming, but her performance has everything an actor needs to receive acting nominations. I can't remember the last time I was fully invested in a single character in such an emotionally powerful manner, and Jones is definitely a major reason.\r\n\r\nA final praise to Paula Huidobro's visually grabbing camera work and Marius de Vries, who composed the movie's subtle yet efficient score and who I'm guessing had a hand in the song choices. Either way, terrific job.\r\n\r\nCODA may very well end up as my favorite film of the 2021's edition of the Sundance Film Festival, and it will undoubtedly become a must-watch movie when it's available worldwide. Si\u00e2n Heder offers her impeccable direction and beautifully written screenplay, which is packed with emotionally powerful moments that left me tearing up for the last forty-five minutes. Boasting an educative, meaningful message regarding the deaf community and what our society perceives as a tremendous handicap/disability, the characteristic visual storytelling and the captivating interactions within the deaf family prove to be incredibly investing, deeply elevating the overall piece. With the help of heartfelt, genuine performances from the supporting cast (mainly Troy Kotsur and Eugenio Derbez), Emilia Jones takes off and lands one of my favorite female performances in a long, long time. A tear-inducing, thoughtful film that I hope will conquer audiences all around the world.\r\n\r\nRating: A", "I cannot think of one person to whom I wouldn\u2019t recommend \u201cCODA,\u201d an uplifting, emotionally rich movie from writer / director Sian Heder. This crowd-pleasing film is one of the first real gems to debut at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, and I\u2019m still riding the wave of good vibes hours later.\r\n\r\nBeing a teenager is difficult enough, but try being Ruby (Emilia Jones). The 17-year-old is the only hearing member of a deaf family, and she spends most of her spare time working on her parents\u2019 (Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur) fishing boat along with her older brother, Leo (Daniel Durant). and serving as their sign language interpreter. Ruby juggles her family responsibilities, her schoolwork, and a newfound passion for her high school\u2019s choir club (and her cute duet partner, Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo)). When her music teacher (Eugenio Derbez) hears that special something in Ruby\u2019s voice, he encourages her to think about a life beyond fishing and supports her in applying to a prestigious music school. This unfairly puts the responsibility of the household on Ruby\u2019s shoulders, and she must choose between keeping her family afloat or pursuing her dreams.\r\n\r\nThis very funny and very honest story has a universal appeal, with charming performances and a likeable family that you\u2019ll want to spend time with. Kotsur and Matlin are terrific as Ruby\u2019s randy parents, and Derbez brings a genuine charisma to his role as the young woman\u2019s mentor. The cast includes three deaf actors, so much of the dialogue is expressed in sign language \u2014 and everything about that feels normal. This film goes a long way in shattering stereotypes about people who are hearing impaired, and that is to be commended.\r\n\r\nHeder has created a film that\u2019s filled with insight, refreshingly direct dialogue, and a fully developed cast of characters that all add up to solid storytelling all around. Not only is this a coming-of-age story for Ruby, but it\u2019s one for her family, too. The four of them struggle through the disappointment that life throws their way, hoping to work together to emerge stronger than ever.\r\n\r\nHeartfelt but never corny, \u201cCODA\u201d is a really special movie about unwavering support, unconditional love, and what it means to be a family.", "**Full Review and Analysis at SpotaMovie.com**\r\nProduced and released by Apple in 2021, CODA is an inspiring movie.

The wrinkle in the story is that the protagonist's parents and brother are all deaf. (CODA = Child of Deaf Adults.)\r\n\r\nThat's where ho-hum departs, and I have two things to say about it: First, this film deserves all the accolades and awards it's received.

Norman was great, he had such a wide range for a young actor and was able to make his emotions feel genuine, which is difficult in a lot of child actors. Hoffman was also quite good, she displays her helplessness to care for both her son and ex-husband tremendously well. Cinematography was top notch and the audio design was brilliant. There are some really cool things that are done with the interview sections/street recordings that create a very unique listening experience. My one complaint is that the movie drags on a little longer than it should. There is not a lot going on in this film, and that is fine because you get to spent time with the characters and see their relationship blossom.

Buddy's connections with every single character are lovely, especially with those played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds and Judi Dench - wait... that was Judi Dench?! I legit didn't even notice until the end credits, which shows how convincing her performance as a Northern Irish grandmother is... or perhaps I need my eyesight tested, who's to say.\r\n\r\nJamie Dornan and Caitr\u00edona Balfe also merit props, in what is a very good release from Kenneth Branagh & Co. The target audience, along with others of course, will adore it, I'm sure. Also... love the choice of black-and-white, fwiw.", "Belfast is packed with powerful images \u2014 shot in Haris Zambarloukos\u2019s majestic black-and-white cinematography (except for a handful of color shots at key moments, notably the escapist windows that film and TV offer the characters) \u2014 beginning with an early scene in which the young protagonist, Buddy (Jude Hill), armed with a wooden sword and a shield/dumpster lid, confronts a mob of unionist protestants who come to attack the houses and businesses of Catholics on Buddy\u2019s Street.\r\n\r\nIn an inferior movie, Buddy would be foolish enough to think that his makeshift weapons could measure up to the rioters\u2019 Molotov cocktails; here, however, it marks precisely the beginning of the end of childhood innocence \u2014 a point driven home later by a reading of chapter thirteen of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (\"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but then I became a man and left childish things behind\u201d).\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s depictions of violence are doubly effective because Branagh resorts to them sparingly, and when he does, he shoots them in a realistic style; when a car explodes in the middle of the street, you can bet your sweet ass it doesn\u2019t just go up in CGI flames.\r\n\r\nThe most striking images, however, are those whose composition evokes an air of domesticity; several of them have in common the background presence, as if detached from the action, of Judi Dench. Branagh, who has collaborated with her on almost a dozen productions, knows very well that the veteran actress is able to conjure, simply by virtue of being there, enough gravitas to anchor a scene in the real world (now, this is not to say that Dench is reduced to prop status; quite the contrary, her character provides the emotional center of the history).\r\n\r\nThese images stay with us because they are all about what is at stake in the film: a fragile lifestyle in which \u201cWe have known this street and all the streets around it all our lives. And every man, woman, and child that lives in every damn house, whether we like it or not. And I like it. And you say you have a little garden for the boys? But here, they can play wherever they want, because everyone knows them, everyone loves them, and everyone cares for them.\u201d Establishing this delicate way of life is the reason that the threat of violence is so much more effective in creating tension than the violence itself.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, Belfast is an episodic slice-of-life-seen-through-a-young-boy\u2019s-eyes that isn\u2019t, believe it or not, a million miles removed from A Christmas Story, and indeed the script introduces a placid, elementary sense of humor that nicely counterbalances the more dramatic material.", "This is the kind of cinema that we always hope to see - brilliantly fresh, tight script, beautifully shot, amazing performances, an autobiographical-based story of the directory himself, Sir Kenneth Branagh, and ... Van Morrison soundtrack. In essence, it's a coming-of-age movie of an adolescent, set against \"The Troubles\" of Northern Ireland. Buddy has a special love for movies and theater, encouraged by his cranky, old grandmother (Dame Judi Dench). The beautiful relationship between the grandfather and grandmother is mirrored perfectly in the mother and father, and then again in Buddy's budding romance with Catherine. There's so much going on in the film that it's very nearly a tone poem.", "\"**Space Sweepers**\" is South Korea's first-ever space science fiction show. For their first venture into space, they did not disappoint and made sure audiences were awed by the show's deep story and unforgettable space adventure.\r\n\r\n> **Space Sweepers** ***is lightyears better from recent Western space scifi shows.***\r\n\r\n## Story\r\nThe story started out as a typical Western space scifi. Humanity encountered a life threatening situation and the only way out was up, out there in outer space. Slowly and perfectly the Korean signature in storytelling and plots surfaced up and it started to get very interesting.\r\n\r\nThere was a grand or overarching story guiding Space Sweepers but they instead zoomed-in and told the story from a human perspective. This approach allowed them to tackle the questions from the vantage point of ordinary humans, attaching the audiences to the characters in ways not possible from a \"bigger picture\" method. A story about a crew of \"Space Sweepers\" but at the same time it was not about them.\r\n\r\nIt is rare to see this type of story and storytelling in live-action movies considering the limited time available and yet they were able to flesh out the characters, presented a family relationship plots, questioned human moralities and ethics, and explored the notion about \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\".\r\n\r\n## Acting/Cast\r\nThe casting was excellent. Song Joong Ki, playing as \"Tae Ho\", and Kim Tae Ri, playing as \"Captain Jang\", are two popular and veteran Korean actors. They were joined in by Jin Seon Kyu as \"Tiger Park\", Yoo Hae Jin as the Robot, and the child actress Park Ye Rin as \"Dorothy\". Five actors who complimented each others' acting style enabled them to bring the story closer to the audience.\r\n\r\nKim Tae Ri is best known from her 2016 movie \"The Handmaiden\" and the Netflix TV series \"Mr. Sunshine\" in 2018. Despite the huge jump from historical romance genre to a space scifi action and adventure, Kim Tae Ri has proven once again her talent in acting. She showed her character's strength and fierceness and yet behind it all she was caring and loving.\r\n\r\nSong Joong Ki is well known from his major role in the hugely popular 2016 TV series \"Descendants of the Sun\". He masterfully played his character, a man who lost his daughter in a tragedy and ended up as a sweeper of space debris to make his living. Throughout the movie, he showed perfectly the thoughts and goals of his character despite of what was in front of him. His emotions and expressions were in check, thus completing the aura of his character while at the same time letting the audience feel his sadness and difficult choices.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention is the child actress Park Ye Rin. She is technically a newbie in the industry, having only appeared as a guest in a 2020 TV series. Having thrown in a blockbuster film this early would have a huge challenge for her and yet she amazingly showed that she was born an actress. She played as \"Dorothy\", one of the key characters in this film. This being a space scifi, which means they had a lot of filming in front of green screens, Park Ye Rin was not distracted and was able to deliver her dialogues and interacted with her co-stars naturally. Oh, did I not say that she's only 7 years old?\r\n\r\n## Production\r\nThey did not shy away from giving this a budget. The superb visual effects, cgi, and editing, definitely placed this movie equal in rank with Western shows like \"Star Trek\" and \"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy\" to name two.\r\n\r\nIt was also a brilliant idea to bring in actors from different nationalities and to use their native languages. This is rarely done and is simply explained as some magic or technology like a \"universal translator\". But that's not where it ends \u2026 even though they have a \"universal translator\", they did not resorted to \"English\" or \"Korean\" as a \"universal language\". They showed all directors in the world how to properly portray different languages even if there is a \"universal translator\" available.\r\n\r\nThat deserves a huge mention especially for a show which concerns multiple nationalities, languages, and cultures--the planet Earth. The flow of the story was not broken even though the characters were speaking different languages. Everything was flowing smoothly, this is how it actually will be like if \"universal translators\" become a reality. Well done!\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nWhile this is a space science fiction film, the story was about you and me, being a human, and the relationships we build in each of our adventures. This is what \"Space Sweepers\" was about. It is about you and me. Our humanity. Our frailties. The challenges we face every single day and how to ultimately triumph (or not).\r\n\r\nCan you guess how many languages were spoken and nationalities represented in \"Space Sweepers\"?\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nOriginally posted on my [blog](https://youronly.one/yuki/review-space-sweepers-2021-202137/) under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 International License.", "\"Army of the Dead was far from surpassing any expectations, but amid its several issues, Zack Snyder actually created a rather interesting post-apocalyptic world.

Matthias delivers a fun, engaging performance that, unfortunately, is partially damaged by the excessive, dull jokes. The rest of the team follows incredibly cliche, forgettable archetypes, even though I can't really fault Nathalie Emmanuel's (F9) interpretation.\r\n\r\nDoing a prequel to an original zombie film with no zombies instantly drops the excitement levels, but the heist sequences are reasonably entertaining. Hans Zimmer and Steve Mazzaro's score definitely makes this movie feel much more epic and emotionally powerful than it truly is.

Ethan Hawke does fantastic in his limited screen time. He conveys the mental state of the Grabber with such nuance, it really makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. The children do very well too, especially in the more emotionally heavy scenes. A few of the classmates performances in the beginning were a bit awkward.

I wasn't expecting much going in (based on its score) and my expectations were met. ;-)", "The Many Saints of Newark is The Sopranos meets The Godfather Part II, and the result is so much less than the sum of its parts. Do we really need to know that Tony Soprano was once a chubby brat? \r\n\r\nMoreover, do we really want to know that that chubby brat grew up to be Michael Gandolfini? Michael would certainly be a chip off the old block, if his father had been Oswald Cobblepot instead of Jim Gandolfini.\r\n\r\nThis is truly a case of the apple falling a million miles away from the tree, but then pretty much everyone here falls short of the original actors/characters (I was never really a fan of the TV show, and even I would rather watch that instead).\r\n\r\nLivia, Junior, Janice, Paulie Walnuts, Silvio Dante, Big Pussy; Soprano diehards will recognize all of these and several other names , but not much else.

It somehow simultaneously disgusts me while filling me with intense emotion capable of drawing tears to my eyes. It is a perfect blend, that I was unaware that I needed.\r\n\r\nThe journey our characters take in immense in terms of emotion and distance. I had such a great time watching our leads travel across country going wherever their hearts desired or wherever their noses took them. There were some creepy and intense encounters that had me on the edge of my seat but that was balanced with intimate moments between our leads. These scenes fill the majority of the 2 hour and twenty-minute runtime, and while that is a decently long film, it flew by, and the pace never seemed to lull. There were some scenes that could have been cut to save some time, but I argue that they were essential for character development and to make the film whole.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the runtime there are intense introspective themes of morality that are at constant play. Watching the characters balance desire and need was so heartbreaking and real. Despite the horrific acts our main characters are performing, there is a deep hidden shame that seeps out as our character learns more and more about what she is.\r\n\r\nThese are very complex emotions to handle on screen and our two leads absolutely nailed it. Both Taylor Russell and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were brilliant! I will be honest, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is one of the big reasons why I wanted to see this movie so much and while he did an excellent job, he was outshined by Taylor Russell.

It encapsulates an era like no other and dares to be so different, yet so appealing. On the surface this film is a very straightforward plot, following our three leads and their attempts at success in the ever-changing world of cinema. But deep down, there is another message that is so relevant to everyone's life: accepting death/irrelevance.\r\n\r\nJust as fast as our characters achieve their dreams of being stars in the industry, these dreams are quickly whisked away by the brutality and cutthroat nature of Hollywood. This is juxtaposed with Brad Pitts character, a man already on downward spiral of his career, trying to desperately hold on to what remains. These arches are so honest and vulnerable, I found very compelling.\r\n\r\nThe performances were top notch all around, and I would expect nothing more from a stacked cast of actors including Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt. But the surprise of the bunch was Diego Calva. He was fantastic and stole many scenes he was featured in with both Robbie and Pitt. He is the true lead of this film and does an excellent job bearing the load.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed almost aspects of the film, but towards the end there are some sequences that I feel got away from Chazelle. They are so over the top and kind of feal out of place in this somewhat grounded story. The tension is there in these scenes, but it just doesn't fit. This whole subplot could have been shorten tremendously helping reduce the bloated runtime of the film.\r\n\r\nThat being, I never really felt the length of this picture with it being quite well paced. Overall, this movie was real treat, and it is quite a shame that marketing was jumbled up so poorly because this film deserves viewership.\r\n\r\nScore: 88%\r\nVerdict: Excellent\r\nTheatre Verdict: See It", "**Thor: Love and Thunder** is a sequel to the 2017 film Thor: Ragnarok. It is written and directed by Taika Waititi and based on, of course, the Marvel Comics by Stan Lee. The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster / Mighty Thor, and Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher.\r\n\r\nAnd the story? The gods are in danger! The God Butcher is coming for them! And only the mightiest of them all can stop him: Thor. But Thor is in bad shape. He's lost his hammer, his friends, and his confidence. He'll need all the help he can get to save the day. He'll have to relearn what it means to be a hero, and Jane Foster will have to become the Mighty Thor.\r\n\r\nI was looking forward to this movie. I loved Taika Waititi's direction in Ragnarok, and the cast is amazing. I was hoping for another fun, fast-paced, and humorous film like its predecessor. But unfortunately, Thor: Love and Thunder falls flat. The story is convoluted and slow-moving, and there are too many characters for any of them to get enough development. The humour is forced, and it frequently fails. And the ending is just...Stranger things have happened, I suppose.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in **Thor: Love and Thunder**. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, you might enjoy it, but if you're looking for another fun and exciting Thor film, I think you'll be disappointed, too.", "Bad humor, characters teleporting all over the place, terrible plot. A thing capable of altering the universe happens to exist, you don't even need infinity stones *facepalm* I can't believe there is a worse Thor movie than The Dark World.", "Best Movie by MARVEL. LOVE YOU THOR", "Nice actin movie.", "It appears that disgraced asshat Bob Chapek (not going to link to IMDb for this asshat since his bio there is just corporate gibberish written by Disney themselves, and not updated to show that he got fired) has scared away any form of actual talent from Disney so that even when they do something that is not blatantly woke and preaching it still turns into a turd.\r\n\r\nAlready in the first scenes I was going what the f\u2026 is this? Are they turning the franchise into a comedy?\r\n\r\nThor himself has been turned into a rambling moron. The rest of the Gods are either unbelievable assholes or fat slobs only caring about their orgies or some combination thereof. Most of the movie I was just cringing in my seat.\r\n\r\nIf they were actually going for more of a comedy movie than an actual Thor movie they failed miserably. The \u201cjokes\u201d where unfunny, unintelligent and just bad. Superhero slapstick at best.\r\n\r\nThe only character that I found remotely likable and cool in the movie was King Valkyrie. Jane Foster was not too bad either. The rest was just a joke. The portrayal of the mighty God Zeus and Olympus was an affront. The bad guy was not too bad although I would not call him likable of course. He is not supposed to be likable. At least he was not turned into a parody.\r\n\r\nIt is really a shame because the underlying story is not half bad\u2026 if it had been given to someone with actual talent to implement. It is predictable of course but it is okay. If it had only been given to someone who could have turned it into a real Thor movie instead of this failed comedy turd.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that I did not have my hopes up very much when starting to watch this movie. Given what Disney has turned into I was afraid that they were literally going to turn Thor into a female and luckily that did not happen. Unfortunately they found another way of ruining the franchise. This movie is nothing like the previous Thor movies. I really liked Thor: The Dark World for example. To me this movie is very close to a franchise killer.\r\n\r\nThe one and a half stars is for the special effects. They were pretty good. The rest of this movie is really bad.", "_Halloween Ends_ is such a weird film, as a standalone movie I enjoyed it but in the trilogies totality it underwhelms and undermines. With each entry in this trilogy, the movies get farther and farther away from what Halloween is. With Ends there is no tension and no horror, there are some good kills but with nothing building up to it they felt stale. This movie also tears down Michael Meyers in a way that felt out of place in the trilogy. Halloween Kills built Michael up to be an indestructible force with the ability to withstand fire or multiple gunshot wounds, but in Ends that is flipped on its head making him weak due to the ending of the predecessor. It left me feeling like the writers had no idea what they were doing in developing this trilogy. The marketing of the movie was a total farce as well. It was building up to a final clash between Laurie and Michael, and while that does happen the majority follows a character that was just introduced (Corey Cunningham). Even though I really like the opening sequence and backstory to Corey, it had no place being centerstage in the final installment. Overall, this movie was slightly better than the sequel but still squanders the potential that Halloween (2018) had for the trilogy. If any more movies or trilogies are made in the future, please for the love of God hire a producer/writer to develop the entire series instead of piecing it together film by film.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _44%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Poor_", "**Poor writing and a confusing story overshadowed a few shining moments and satisfying conclusions to character stories.**\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so hard to choose whether I liked or disliked Halloween Ends. I enjoyed the resolution to Laurie Strode\u2019s 40-year story arc and the hopeful journey for her granddaughter, Allyson. Even the final showdown between Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers was satisfying, although the story didn\u2019t build to the climax well. Sadly that is where the pros stop. The story was a convoluted mess that ignored all the build-up of the first two films and focused on a new character that didn\u2019t matter to the overall story and didn\u2019t have much impact on the film. As a result, Halloween Ends forgot what made its two predecessors successful and told a pointless meandering tale that had its moments but ultimately disappointed.", "An unfortunate end, to a horror franchise, that started way back in 1978. \r\n\r\nHalloween Ends, is an inarticulate mess, that fails to build on past films. Instead, it delivers an incomprehensible story, that makes little to no sense, save that it brings the overriding story, to a somewhat confused, conclusion. \r\n\r\nOn the upside solid acting and some tense, jump scare moments but really, its not enough.\r\n\r\nIn summary, a reasonable cast in a poorly scripted film, that add's little to nothing that is meaningful, to the tale of serial killer, Michael Myers.", "It's a sad state of affairs when HALLOWEEN ENDS (2022) is being classed as a \"bad\", \"terrible\" or \"disgraceful\" motion picture and I worry for cinema as a whole if the only direction the mass want is nothing but cookie-cutter.\r\n\r\nThis film is a straaaaaaange beast and it probably holds the world record for the quickest development of a relationship on screen. Bloody hell, I wanted that relationship to succeed.\r\n\r\nI'm going to be controversial here... did we need Michael Myers at all here? Maybe the 2 or so scenes we get in the sewer early into the film and that's it... maybe pass the evil on and Michael die of his wounds.\r\n\r\nThe evil is contagious element worked for me and Corey (played by Rohan Campbell) was the standout character.\r\n\r\nIssues? Yes, there are some - the narration and memoir aspect weren't needed and Corey's mum... erm, I'll leave it there.\r\nBut I admire this film, oh boy do I. I'd rather the risk be taken than them fall back into the same old routine.\r\n\r\nNow, before I start the Corey Appreciation Society, all I have left to say is... give a new biscuit a try.", "Well there is a hewn-out pumpkin that looks ever so slightly scary... Otherwise, this is just one \"Halloween\" movie too many and it's only scream yells \"put me out of my misery\" pretty much from the start of this slow and plodding denouement to the franchise. Rohan Campbell (\"Corey\") is bullied by some kids who end up shoving him from a bridge. He is dragged into the storm drains by you know who and emerges a man possessed. He has also attached himself to \"Allyson\" (Andi Matichak) who just happens to be the daughter of long suffering \"Laurie\" (Jamie Lee Curtis) and after a bit of hysteric family melodrama, all of her demons are flee-flowing and we are heading, slowly and ponderously to a conclusion that the best of which has already been seen many times in the trailers. This is far too long, virtually nothing happens until the last fifteen minutes and even then, there isn't even the vaguest hint of menace or jeopardy. The production is adequate, but JLC doesn't really feature often enough - as in \"Halloween Kills\" (2021) to make much impact - and the whole thing is episodic and smacks of made for television. Please let it be the final instalment - this bears no resemblance whatsoever to the original 1978 introduction to \"Myers\" et al.", "Okay, seriously, when is the real \"Halloween Ends\" be released? What I saw for the bulk was some lame CW-like story. I have to think at this point David Gordon Green and the writer crew are just pulling a prank. I half expected a post-credit scene with Impractical Jokers...\r\n\r\nI don't even know what to say. I had low expectations going in given how much I disliked Halloween Kills but Ends didn't even meet the lows of the lows. Really dumb. **1.0/5**", "I thought this was great.\r\n\r\nI only knew of the off-screen drama about <em>'Don\u2019t Worry Darling'</em>, thankfully I hadn't read or seen anything at all about the plot - which, obviously, helped my enjoyment. As such, I was extremely interested in the first chunk of this. It builds up nicely, revealing details here and there. The ending isn't as strong but I still dig it, don't get me wrong.\r\n\r\nThe cast are terrific, even if Florence Pugh completely wipes the floor with her co-stars... and I don't mean that negatively on them one bit, it's simply a case of Pugh giving an outstanding performance. This is only the third film of her's that I've seen... gotta watch more!\r\n\r\nAway from Pugh, I was impressed by Harry Styles. He can act. I will say, though, that Shia LaBeouf would've been greater in the role though. Elsewhere, Olivia Wilde (also dir.), Chris Pine and Gemma Chan do good things.\r\n\r\nIs it a perfect film? Not at all. Is it entertaining? Sure is. Each to their own, but I thoroughly enjoyed this 2022 release.", "Pretty cool, I wasn't expecting the reveal of what's really going on towards the end. Wish it leaned into the horror / unsettling aspects a bit more.", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling\u201d isn\u2019t the massive mess that so many predicted, but it does suffer from a few major problems. The script (written by Katie Silberman) lacks grace and polish, one star\u2019s questionable acting skills is amplified by the other lead\u2019s performance, and Olivia Wilde\u2018s direction is noticeably weak. But there\u2019s still something mesmerizing about this feminist-tinged film and its commentary on the supposed ideals of a patriarchal society.\r\n\r\nAlice (Florence Pugh) and Jack (Harry Styles) live a charmed life in the experimental utopia known as Victory. The town is exclusively for employees of the top-secret Victory Project and their families, and it\u2019s truly the most perfect place in the world \u2014 or so it seems. Company CEO Frank (Chris Pine) is the visionary behind it all, a stylish, confident leader whom the men all want to emulate. He provides everything the town\u2019s residents need, asking only for loyalty and obedience in return.\r\n\r\nVictory is a place that embodies the idyllic 1950s life, where the women cook and clean, dress to perfection, and spend their free time day drinking, lounging by the pool, and gossiping with friends. The men fulfill their role in this society too, by going to work at the mysterious headquarters and returning like clockwork in the evenings. It\u2019s a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell type of community, until Alice begins having strange, nightmarish visions. She begins to explore the more sinister side of Victory, hoping to eventually expose what\u2019s really going on beneath the facade of domestic bliss.\r\n\r\nThe plot is one that\u2019s been done before, and there isn\u2019t much by way of originality. What makes the first part of the film so successful is that the story is told from the point of view of the women in town. By presenting the narrative through the lens of an army of happy homemaker wives, there\u2019s an ominous tone throughout \u2014 especially when the ladies in town turn to self-harm in order to take back control of their lives.\r\n\r\nAlice is a strong female character, and Pugh proves yet again that she\u2019s one of the most exciting talents working in Hollywood today. Much is asked of her and she is up to the task of doing the heavy lifting here, especially in her many scenes with Styles. To put it bluntly, Pugh acts Styles under the table and then some. I believe the film would have been more successful with a more talented leading man.\r\nWhen the ending finally comes through a long drawn out reveal, it\u2019s a letdown that feels like an episode of \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d If you examine some of the film\u2019s earlier scenes, the story doesn\u2019t feel quite as airtight as it should.\r\n\r\nThe themes are excessive and overdone, presenting the conservative male ideal of relationships and life. It\u2019s a chilling statement about women\u2019s rights and responsibilities, and men\u2019s desire to control and dominate. The timing for this message couldn\u2019t be more perfect with the tumultuous political climate that\u2019s spreading around the world. As a woman, I appreciate the sentiment of \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling\u201d and the feminist lens in which its presented, but I just wish the film had been more successful overall.", "**Overall : A big YEP to NOPE!**\r\n\r\nJordan Peele\u2019s creativity is unrivaled! Nothing is typical of anything he does. Even knowing it is an alien movie, he keeps things fresh with surprising twists and eerie tension. Unlike anything I have seen before\u2014there is excellent symbolism through the flashback sequences. I also enjoyed the developing relationship between the main two characters. My only complaint is that the horror and dread so palpable at the beginning fades completely about two-thirds into the film.", "They said it and you wont hear me disagreeing with it. Did I find it entertaining? \"nope\". Did  I feel the story was cohesive and comprehensible, with a clear contextual message? \"nope\". Were characterisations relatable and relevant? \"Sort of\". \r\n\r\nNope's characterisations are moderately relatable but somehow, also seem to appear oddly misconstrued. The mostly monosyllabic cowboy character, for example, only adds to the sense of ambiguity (perhaps that's the idea).To my mind however, this ploy, if that's what it is, stifles development, of the already ambiguous, story line. The sister, his complete antithesis, is superficially verbose but seems equally, to lack any depth of self awareness.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can say conclusively about Nope, is the visuals are  compelling, complex and, at times, almost intricate. This film certainly scores a A+ in this regard. \r\n\r\nThat said, so much else is lacking, in particular a clearly articulated narrative, that it failed to resonate, with me. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I found Nope a frustrating, dissatisfying watch. Somewhat  reminiscent of M. Night\" Shyamalan films Nope is visually stunning but does  not offer up enough morsels of knowledge, leaving this viewer hungry for more.", "I do noi Ike horror movies as a rule, but I liked this one, so I suspect that \u201cNope\u201d didn\u2019t have enough gore or shocking surprises for the average fan of that genre.  I thought the acting and writing were fine, and the title was a subtle selection. The odd subplot of the incident with Gordy the monkey reminded me of the movie Magnolia for some reason. I wonder if that film was any kind of an influence on Jordan Peele\u2019s storytelling style?\r\n\r\nThe entity in this movie is rather quirky and odd as we learn how it operates and its likes and dislikes. I will say no more than that because learning about it is part of the fun, though I am sure it made it too slow moving for thriller fans. It won\u2019t be a favorite of mine, but it makes the short list of horror movies I have watched and liked just fine.", "All you all that like movies like this are going to be really embarrassed once it's not hip to be racist anymore.  You know, one this woke crap ends and we go back to judging people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.\r\n\r\nBut then isn't judging people by the content of their character \"racist\" today?  You have to judge by skin color right?\r\n\r\nThis is Peele, he makes a point about that, because once more all white people are idiots or evil, and now all Asians are idiots and evil too, because in woke culture they are \"white adjacent.\"\r\n\r\nIt's more veiled racism that people today applaud, call intelligent, and when the woke market ends, they are going to liken it to \"the Turner Diaries\"", "A really well made flick!\r\n\r\n<em>'Nope'</em> comes across as a pretty unique film, even if the core premise isn't necessarily that. I enjoyed seeing it all come together, the conclusion is the most entertaining part - as it ought to be, I guess. The cinematography, meanwhile, is ace.\r\n\r\nI also dig the special effects, although oddly I feel like the main thing's effect slightly (!) dropped off a bit towards the end - but that could just be the fact that we see more of it at that point, as opposed to the prior snippets.\r\n\r\nKeke Palmer is excellent throughout, the clear standout in my opinion. Daniel Kaluuya and Steven Yeun are also enjoyable, as are Michael Wincott and Brandon Perea to be fair - albeit less so. Neat to see Keith David involved too, I need to see him in a more prominant role at some point - only ever seems to be a bit-part in what I've seen of him thus far.", "It's quite fun to try and spot the famous names who pepper this otherwise puerile and really rather unfunny film - but that was about it for me. It's all about a \"Dante\" (Brian O'Halloran) and \"Elias\" (Trevor Fehrman) who run a small-town store. They spend much of their day quoting lines from their favourite films until poor old \"Elias\" has an heart attack. Whisked to hospital, his friends decide to make a film about life in their convenience store. What now ensues may well offer us an isight into just how a sudden medical emergency can focus the attention and motivate people, but I just found the references either too in-your-face or absurdly obscure and contrived. Perhaps this will rate better in the USA, but here in the UK this just comes across as a rather sad indictment of rural life where it's all about weed and dumb wheezes. It is extremely difficult to marry the threads of humour and tragedy. Dark humour, in my view, is the hardest to write and play well - and I am afraid that nobody here really carries it off with much distinction. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but I didn't hear anyone else in the cinema laughing either. Not for me, sorry.", "I guess Kevin Smith is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nBut, as the Dark Knight pointed out \"you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" I guess Smith live long enough.\r\n\r\nChasing Amy was always my favorite, but Clerks and Mall Rats were classics, Clerks II was pretty hysterical, Dogma (especially if you are Catholic like me) is absolutely cutting and brilliantly so. Jay and Silent Bob... to much of the side characters, but at the end of the day they all had something in common...\r\n\r\n... they all cut into fandoms in only the way that fans, legit come to the comic book store every Wednesday, know what Diamond Distribution is fans of geek fandoms can completely and hysterically criticize the things they love.\r\n\r\nHe even cut into the original Star Wars. It was Geek Counter Culture and we loved every minute of it.\r\n\r\nClerks III has NONE OF THAT. Smith used to criticize pop culture, and now that he's part of it, his scripts don't work. They lost their edge. The brilliance of his early work has faded to the land of sell outs.\r\n\r\nNow you are more likely to see him weep over a bad Star Wars movie in an obvious shill than you are to see him make jokes about how many innocent construction workers died in the second Death Star.\r\n\r\nAnd when he stopped being able to take apart fandom's and playfully make jabs at them, when he stopped criticizing pop culture and started to shill for it, he became irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to watch Clerks III, everything that made the first two... that made most of his early work great is absent in this on.", "**A worthy end to a franchise that took a while to captivate my interest.**\r\n\r\nI didn't like the first film very much, as I even mentioned in the text I wrote for it. However, I was able to enjoy the sequel, and although this film is not as good as it is, it ends up being able to give a decent ending to the trilogy: Dante and Randal continue to run their shop, and both are haunted by heart diseases, the result of of the bad life habits they had. After recovering from a heart problem, Randal decides to make an autobiographical film based on his professional experience.\r\n\r\nThe movie was specially thought for Clerks fans. There is no concern about attracting new audiences or pleasing the general public, it is felt from the beginning that it is a film designed to close a larger work, not to give it continuity. The greatest proof of this turns out to be the omnipresence of metaphysical themes, such as illness, religion, death and what happens after it. The characters are the same as usual, and the film even has some special appearances (as had been customary in previous films), and there is nothing surprising in what they do or say.\r\n\r\nThe cast remains the same, with Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson pontificating and dominating everything with a remarkable job, very well done. Next to them are Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, who have an important part in the most hilarious scenes. And although Rosario Dawson has a good capacity and talent for comedy, her character takes on a much more dramatic and profound facet here, which gave the film greater emotion.", "I tend to like movies with less action and more introspection and more \u201ctalkative.\u201d Still, since I had read the book on this and saw other reports, I wondered if this might all seem like old news when I watched it. But I found out to be enthralling. I engaged with the lead characters and appreciated the excellent work of the secondary characters. For example, a quiet but strong portrayal of the partner of one of the reporters who seemed to be a reporter in his own right but who was supportive of her efforts.\r\n\r\nI felt they didn\u2019t go for the melodramatic approach here as they well might have. They merely hinted about moments like one of them wondering if a car occupant was watching her, and used just one threatening phone call when they probably actually had many of them. It kept the story cleaner and moving forward.\r\n\r\nShe Said reminded me of All the Presidents Men, with the two investigative reporters being held to a standard of having sufficient sources to back up their reporting but where Woodward and Bernstein seemed mostly concerned with holding people accountable for their illegal actions, the journalists in she Said connected and formed a personal bond with the victims they located and encouraged to speak out.", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\nImportant subject matter doesn\u2019t always translate to a good movie, and \u201cShe Said\u201d is a botched attempt at retelling the true story of two New York Times reporters who took down the infamous Hollywood abuser, Harvey Weinstein. It\u2019s something with which the industry is very familiar, and the years of sexual misconduct that the two women uncovered is horrifying. It was one of the most important articles to ever run in the newspaper, but this story would be better suited to the page and not the screen.\r\n\r\nThe film follows writers Megan Twohey (Carey Mulligan) and Jodi Kantor (Zoe Kazan) as they investigate the Miramax movie mogul, trying repeatedly to get big name actresses to go on the record to expose Weinstein\u2019s gross abuse of power. Instead of offering new insight, director Maria Schrader uses the same old newsroom clich\u00e9s to create a pedestrian investigative journalism film. It\u2019s procedural, boring, and repetitive, with a series of scenes featuring the two leads making phone calls, writing or reading text messages, and sitting in editorial meetings. Of course, this is less than interesting because the story isn\u2019t cinematic: it\u2019s dull.\r\n\r\nThe film touches on the more interesting aspects of working as a woman in Hollywood, as many of Weinstein\u2019s victims refused to be named on the record because they were terrified they\u2019d never work again. This did happen more often than not, and he either bought or forced their silence. Perhaps if screenwriter Rebecca Lenkiewicz had decided to focus more on the personal dilemmas and fallout his victims faced rather than only briefly touch on them, this would have been a stronger and more powerful movie.\r\n\r\nEven worse, the film doesn\u2019t feel timely. The decision to tell this story now seems dated and past its expiration date. Women will always remember the #MeToo movement and it will go down in history as one of the most important feminist campaigns of the 2000s, but many of us would rather forget about Weinstein while he rots away in jail.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s where my biggest problem with the film comes in: the story leaves a really bad taste in my mouth, especially when you stop to realize that many of Weinstein\u2019s employees, friends, and peers either aided in covering up his crimes or even worse, willfully looked the other way. Harvey\u2019s touchy nature and treatment of subordinates was the worst kept secret in Hollywood circles. He was as creep, and many who met him were uncomfortable being in his presence. It feels a bit disingenuous (or perhaps just a bit ironic) to make a movie about it, even if the story\u2019s focus is on the two reporters.\r\n\r\nThe better parts of the narrative inspire with the proof of the power of journalism to encourage change, and Kantor and Twohey absolutely played a huge part in giving women who were victimized the courage to come forward. Mulligan gives a strong performance, but it\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t have an equally robust script to work with. Both of the leads feel wasted, especially when they are called on to do little more than rattle off facts and name-drop big actresses who came forward to expose the year of abusive behavior by Weinstein.

In fact, the lead character of this movie was the worse part! Her frantic screams, frustrated outbursts, and emotional moments made the typical c-list shark movie actors look much better. It is shocking how annoying her performance was. On top of that, the green screen was very noticeable and overused, making me wonder how much water even made it into this movie. I am surprised that this director also made The Princess, which was a well-done, fun action movie. What happened to this movie, then? The Requin isn\u2019t just a bad movie; it is bad for a bad shark movie! Don\u2019t waste your time.", "Redeeming Love looks great. It features great locations shot with great cinematography, but that\u2019s about all director D.J. Caruso can do to entice us to keep watching. It\u2019s terrific to see a story unfolding in a non-CGI, true-to-life setting, even if it\u2019s Cape Town standing in for California (but then some of the greatest westerns were filmed in Europe, so there\u2019s that), but while this movie arguably achieves the western look, it fails to conjure up any sort of western feel.\r\n\r\nThe script concerns a Hooker with a Heart of Gold known as Angel, who is so sought after that the local Madame, who calls herself Duchess, holds a daily raffle to determine which lucky slack-jawed gold miners \u2013 there is more than one winner per day \u2013 get to hold sexual congress with her. This is such a cumbersome arrangement that it actually gets in the way of the plot, so that co-writers Francine Rivers and Caruso Hand Wave it not long after they have introduced it.\r\n\r\nSo-called \u201cdirt farmer\u201d Michael Hosea becomes smitten with Angel, so what does he do to get near her? Does he buy all the numbers in the raffle? Does he have the raffle rigged? No and no; he simply \u201cpays double\u201d. That\u2019s it. Why this hasn\u2019t occurred to at least some of the yokels who form a daily scrum outside the brothel is anybody\u2019s guess. Another good question is where Michael, who is not a miner, finds enough \u201cgold dust\u201d to gain access to Angel on three different occasions.\r\n\r\nAngel wants nothing to do with Michael owing to a deep-seated hatred and distrust of men, which is established in a series of flashbacks that are so many and so long they could make up an entire, separate movie all by themselves. They are also the reason that Redeeming Love unnecessarily breaks the 120-minute mark. But the oddest part about these flashbacks is that they show Angel escaping a life of compulsory whoredom only to enter a life of voluntary whoredom. Twice. Maybe even thrice, but that last time is once again against her will. In any case, it gets to be quite repetitive after a while.\r\n\r\nIt is only after Angel gets the tar beaten out of her by the Duchess\u2019s lackey Magowan that she relents and agrees to marry Michael \u2013 but first he has to pay off her \u201cdebt\u201d to the Duchess, and the irony that he literally buys Angel off in order to make an honest woman out of her is lost on Michael and Caruso alike.\r\n\r\nRedeeming Love\u2019s greatest achievement, other than its photography, is how well it masks its biblical pedigree. According to Wikipedia this is a \u201cChristian Western\u201d based on an homonymous novel by Rivers (unread by me, though it wouldn\u2019t surprise if she had first published it under the pseudonym F.R. Ancine), which in turn is inspired by an obscure Old Testament book \u2013 not that you would even guess at any of this by watching the movie, and that\u2019s actually a good thing. It may be long and boring, but at least it\u2019s not overtly preachy.", "_Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery_ is a lighthearted murder mystery filled with effective comedy, fantastic performances, and a somewhat predictable plot.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a great time with this film and the theater experience was one of my favorites of the year. The plot is somewhat similar to the first, a murder happens and Benolt Blanc is there to solve it. It hits all the familiar beats but does not work quite as well as its predecessor, this is mainly due to the characters. The performances were great and they work well in isolation from the overarching story, but all of them are such over-the-top caricatures that are hard to believe their connections or motivations to kill. Their banter with each other is charming and funny and helps carry this movie forward.\r\n\r\nThe first quarter of this movie was pretty poorly done. A lot of the setup had pandemic references and humor that felt really out of place in 2022. So many movies before this have touched on those topics that it felt overdone and boring. Really interesting choice for this type of film, but once the characters get to the island all of that awkward setup is left on the mainland and the movie starts to find its footing.\r\n\r\nFrom this point forward, I had a great time. Daniel Craig was fantastic as Benolt Blanc and it was quite funny to see him as a fish out of water surrounded by corporate elites. The majority of the lines I laughed at were delivered by him with a dry pan sense of delivery. It was organic and played well on screen. Edward Norton was a fantastic addition and the majority of the cast did excellently. They were really funny and delivered the stereotyped character performances well.\r\n\r\nMuch like the beginning of the movie, the last ten minutes did not work tremendously well for me. It was quite corny, over the top, and unrealistic. It diminishes the greatness of the middle of the film.\r\n\r\nEven though this movie fails to reach the heights of the original, it does enough to deliver a very entertaining mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed. It is a shame that Netflix is only having a limited release for this film because it is best in a crowded theater on the silver screen.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _77%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Great_", "MORE SPOILER-FREE MINI-REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/mini-reviews-2022-edition/\r\n\r\n\"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery would never disappoint.

Exceptional performances from a shockingly talented cast - Daniel Craig and Janelle Mon\u00e1e are the standouts - elevate a screenplay slightly lacking in character depth as well as better control over its clear yet repetitive message concerning opportunism, vanity, and hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nOriginal remains supreme, but this sequel deserved a worldwide premiere on the big screen.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "Brilliant!\r\n\r\nMy first film of 2023, which has started with a bang! I adore the original film from 2019 so was expecting big things from this sequel and I'm glad to note that it didn't disappoint - it's a cracker. I did, admittedly, predict the general gist of what was going to happen, though (in this case, minor) predictability doesn't always equel badness - like here, I was thoroughly entertained no matter what.\r\n\r\nThe cast from the first film are better, though those that star in this 2022 release are excellent. Daniel Craig is, of course, superb as Benoit Blanc once again, every single moment with him is terrific. Janelle Mon\u00e1e also gives a fantastic performance, I predominantly know of her from music but with this, and <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hidden-figures/\">Hidden Figures</a>'</em>, she can certainly act too.\r\n\r\nKate Hudson, Dave Bautista and Edward Norton are the best of the others, though even the likes of Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr. and Madelyn Cline are good value as well. Like its predecessor, it's very astutely cast.\r\n\r\nThe film is put together in high quality fashion, Rian Johnson & Co. did a great job - particularly with the framing of certain shots, as well as the music which is real neat. As you'd expect for a film of this sort, there are some nice little details spread across the well utilised run time.

There were a few interesting plot twists and, even though the dialogue could have been more witty, it was intelligent and realistic.\r\n\r\nI did find that the Renoir character reminded me of an Agatha Christie character, in that he reeled off suppositions he\u2019d made based on information we hadn\u2019t been given full access to. Also, he owed some of his success to a character who he asked to take a snoop around, and she proceeded to be in several spots just in time to hear critical details. Pretty lucky. Then again.

The first part presented a group of well-known stars in a different format than the roles they played in previous acting works.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, I face many challenges: Will the second part be better than the first part, or at least equal to it? Secondly, yes it presents us with a group of stars with beautiful charisma on the screen.\r\n\r\nThis time, the events of the film take place during the pandemic. This time, the main investigator, the hero of the story, is facing deadly boredom due to him staying at home all the time due to the pandemic and the lockdown. This is what drives him, without hesitation, to participate in one of the games organized by a rich person. This game is to solve a crime, hypothetically a crime that didn't happen in reality. This invitation reaches the investigator and some close friends of this rich person, but during their arrival to the place of the invitation, we begin to discover many mysterious things.\r\n\r\nThe first is how the friends get to know each other. Each character is completely different from the other character, a rich person, a YouTuber model, a scientist, in addition to a political figure and an investigator. We begin to discover, by starting the conversation from the beginning, that there is a suspicious or unhealthy past for each character, but the most important thing is that it is far from the game and the hypothetical investigation. We begin to discover real crimes in the place of Al-Daghwa, and now everyone is a suspect, and through the story we will learn who the culprit is.\r\n\r\nYes, I am almost certain that the characters of the second part will continue on the same path as the movie of the first part. What I did not like about this movie. Yes, they showed us the motives and reasons, but I could not get behind any motive in them, and in these types of stories, the most beautiful thing is that it shows that you made a mistake about who the murderer is, not Only in deceiving you, but showing you that your deductions were wrong, makes you doubt one or two or three people, and in the end you discover that all your doubts were wrong. In this part, I was not able to doubt anyone.\r\n\r\nYes, it is true, there are many good plots in the scenario, and there is good manipulation, but I cannot be certain that I doubt any character, as if I was waiting and seeing the events for the vision to appear. I could not participate in the game, which is very important in this type of movie. In addition to clarifying things, there were many coincidences to the point of being so ridiculous. The only reason some mysteries and some indicators were discovered is that the character, for some reason, was present at the right time and the right place without any actual intelligence to find the information.\r\n\r\nI don't know. I feel that my feelings were confused towards the end of the movie. I would almost describe it as childish ending. the actions of some characters led to the flattening of this movie. The first part was so amazing that it cannot be described.", "So a group of friends with the usual collection of personal relationship baggage arrive at a rural cabin after ten years of not meeting. After a brief exploration of the place, they find themselves at the mercy of a board game that requires their undivided attention else a crossbow will put paid to each of them. Initially they are all petrified - especially as two of their number take fairly early exits (perhaps they'd read the whole script?) - but gradually they realise that team work might be their only hope of salvation. What now ensues is just a mess. It contrives to include just about every stereotypical character known to man in what seems like an overlong hundred minutes of attitude that really just fell flat. After about twenty minutes I was merrily supporting the would be killer who just couldn't mow down this lot fast enough. There's a bit of a twist at the end which might have worked better had I cared in the slightest about their survival, but even that seemed engineered only to create something that, horrifyingly, suggested that a sequel might be in the back of someone's mind!

Nevertheless, the filmmaker delivers a brutal, shocking story about friendship and the importance of some alone time.

The stories set up does a fantastic job at engaging the audience, we feel for Padraic, truly wanting to know why his lifelong friend would \"ghost\" him. This sense of despair soon leads to horror as the plot progresses, creating some uncomfortable moments for both our main character and the audience. Overall, there is just something about this movie that is able to hook me. I had many laughs mixed while feeling completely heartbroken for Padriac. It is a slow burn film, with not much action, but the performances and dialogue are able to carry this movie to completion, resulting in a very unique experience.\r\n\r\nScore: 88%\r\nVerdict: Excellent", "This is one of the most brilliant movies I've seen in a long time. I understand why some people might not fully appreciate the story (which reminds me of Aronofsky's Black Swan in that it's a painfully slow descent into Hell). I find this film as complex as a fine scotch, or a fine wine. The top note is, of course, the beautiful visuals created by Ben Davis. The acting all around is phenomenal. Farrell and Gleeson were, of course, nothing short of spectacular. The real surprise was the character created by Barry Keoghan. I couldn't help but be amazed by how real his character was. Although I was expecting the banshees to be like in the horror film I saw as a kid, I really appreciated the Shakespearean witch device. It was perfect in this context. The second note of flavor of this masterpiece is all about relationships in a closed community. If you ever lived in a condo, an association community or the like, you will recognize the day-to-day pettiness that everyone thinks is so important. A subtle addition to the complex layers of flavor is Burwell's perfect score. And the deep flavor of this movie? It is the parallel that the protagonists finally draw to the meaninglessness of the Civil War that rages on the mainland. If two people within a single tribe cannot make a peace, how is this poor world ever going to live?", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n_This film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival_\r\n\r\nWriter and director Martin McDonagh is no stranger to creating stories that find humor in darkness. In fact, it\u2019s arguably what he does best. With his latest film \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin,\u201d McDonagh captures the sadness of a breakup between two longtime friends with his signature darkly comedic, cynical tone. It\u2019s an emotional character study about loneliness and isolation that expertly blends humor and cruelty, and it\u2019s one of my favorite films so far this year.\r\n\r\nSet on a fictional remote island during the Irish Civil War of 1922, the film tells the story of buddies P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson), two men who find themselves at an impasse. It all starts one day when Colm unexpectedly and abruptly decides to end their friendship, offering no explanation and leaving his former pal stunned and saddened. With the help of his sister Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon) and the troubled islander Dominic (Barry Keoghan), P\u00e1draic plans to do whatever it takes to repair the estranged relationship. His repeated efforts to reconcile annoy Colm to the point that he delivers a shocking ultimatum, which in turn escalates the petty feud to an alarming standoff that could have violent consequences.\r\n\r\nWorking from an outline of a sad breakup, McDonagh\u2019s script flows with a natural rhythm that\u2019s brimming with sharp wit and wry, dark humor. This isn\u2019t a complex narrative, but the dialogue is impassioned and poignant with a genuine understanding of the human condition. McDonagh\u2019s writing is like no other, with a natural talent that\u2019s enviable. The script plays directly to the specific strengths of his cast, too.\r\n\r\nFeaturing Oscar-caliber performances, Gleeson and Farrell strike the perfect harmony as Colm and P\u00e1draic. Their rapport is natural and relaxed, and there\u2019s a comfortable feeling between the two actors which no doubt stems from being reunited with McDonagh. This trio should continue to make movies together because something magical happens when they do. Condon and Keoghan are also excellent in this story of conflicts, as Siobh\u00e1n grapples with the realization that she may risk dying from an unhappy and unfulfilled life if she continues resisting her her urge to flee, and Dominic must deal with the mental suffering of being worn down by his abusive policeman father.\r\n\r\nThe strongest supporting turns come from the scene-stealing animal actors, who represent loyalty and unconditional friendship in a story that\u2019s peppered with a dark undercurrent. Even as the humans around them struggle with their worlds falling apart (and a civil war raging nearby), their equine and canine companions keep them grounded. One of the most memorable scenes features a touching moment between a miniature donkey and a horse, and it is one that absolutely destroyed me. It\u2019s moments like these that add up to a fiercely affective film that is adept at delivering a highly emotional experience to the audience.\r\n\r\nNot only is McDonagh an effective writer, but he is also a talented director with a knack for capturing and creating a mood. Working in tandem with his cinematographer Ben Davis, the film is filled with stunning photography and astonishingly gorgeous scenery of coastal Ireland. These desolate landscapes lend a natural beauty that in turn creates a strong sense of place, providing the perfect backdrop for the story.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin\u201d is an example of that increasingly rare instance where a film fully and completely achieves its desired effect. Backed by two of the finest performances of the year and a superbly written script, this is a piece of accomplished, outstanding filmmaking.", "_Memory_ juggles so many subplots to unsatisfactory results. It\u2019s as if the story throws a ball in the air for every concept in the film (Alzheimer\u2019s, human trafficking, the FBI vs the police, rich people getting whatever they want, etc) only to allow each ball to smack against the ground without trying to catch them after their initial toss. For a film about a guy who kills people with the authorities chasing him for nearly two hours, _Memory_ is a monotonous bore. Not even Liam Neeson lighting himself on fire to cauterize a bullet wound can save what is otherwise a forgetful and fatigued memoir of a hoary hit man.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Memory-2022-Review-A-Forgetful-and-Fatigued-Memoir-of-a-Hoary-Hit-Man", "**Memory isn't terrible, but it's a little too slow for an action thriller and isn't edgy enough for a crime thriller. Sadly, Memory is forgettable.**\r\n\r\nI'm a big Liam Neeson fan. He trained Batman and Obi-Wan, led the A-Team and the Men in Black, and had the most intimidating and awesome phone call in cinematic history. Non-Stop, The Commuter, and The Grey were all solid films, too, but let's face it\u2026 he isn't getting any younger, so his action movies are slowing in pace. Memory was smart enough to incorporate that into the script while still having Neeson kick some butt. This movie is an improvement over some of his recent stuff like the Marksman (and, from what I hear, Blacklight), but I sure do miss the days of Taken or Kingdom of Heaven. My hopes were higher with Martin Campbell directing, but I spent most of the movie looking at my phone. It's not terrible, but it needed to be a little darker and more menacing to hold my attention. In the end, you won't care to remember much about Memory.

Creative use of Christmas songs will leave audiences crying with laughter.\r\n\r\nA brilliant homage to the seasonal genre classics that should be seen in a packed theater!\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "Yeah I'm going to give this top marks, not because it is really that good, but because it came out in 2022 and was probably the best thing in the theater at the time (which was probably why the other Movie Data Base started deleting positive reviews of it).  \r\n\r\nBut a lot of it is done right, it features an interracial family but doesn't make the race a key part of the story.  In fact, it doesn't even mention it at all.  Instead it follows the story of a little girl and Santa. \r\n\r\nAnd the Santa is a bit weird, there is a lot of things that just don't fit with his character, but that doesn't matter because the story is just so fun that you willingly suspend most of your disbelief.\r\n\r\nIt is violent and does a great job of making the violence both exciting and at times comical.  It drops Easter eggs in some of the best possible ways.  Not all the men are evil and idiotic and not all the women are practically perfect in every way.  They are just written as, well, as unique characters.\r\n\r\nAnd you really have to appreciate it in 2022 when most movies drop characters for checked boxes.  \r\n\r\nIt was probably the only movie that you could go into in 2022 and just be entertained by.

Either way, I'd very much recommend <em>'Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody'</em>.\r\n\r\nI'm no Houston brainiac but of course knew of her top songs and unfortunate personal issues, I feel like the film does a commendable job at covering all aspects - the pacing is top notch, in my opinion. I'd imagine it takes liberties with the truth, as per for this genre, here and there, but that doesn't bother me much if so.\r\n\r\nNaomi Ackie is terrific in the lead role, quite the first performance of her's to watch on my part. I hope to see more! The rest of the cast, from Stanley Tucci to Ashton Sanders to Tamara Tunie to Nafessa Williams to Clarke Peters, particularly the latter, are also very good throughout.\r\n\r\nI found the run time to be spot on, while the music is - as you'd expect - excellent.

However, to my surprise it's the exact opposite to all that. It's supremely entertaining and very amusing!\r\n\r\nI love the whole style of the film, the editing is top notch. the bloody visuals are class and the music is superbly chosen - every track hits. Then you also have an excellent cast. I thought, again based on the trailer(s) that I saw, it would be a run-of-the-mill Brad Pitt feature, but his performance is terrific throughout.\r\n\r\nAaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry are a quality double act, I thought their accents and dynamic would get tiresome but if anything I enjoyed them the more I saw them - funny guys! Joey King was the only character I wasn't sold on during the film, though by the end I dug her performance too.\r\n\r\nAndrew Koji and Hiroyuki Sanada are also very good, while Michael Shannon, Benito A. Mart\u00ednez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) and Zazie Beetz are welcomed cast members as well. There are also a few other noteworthy people involved, including two that Pitt knows well from a different <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-city-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2022 flick</a>. Seriously, what a cast!\r\n\r\nIf I had to mention one gripe, it would be the run time/pacing - this is me nit-picking, though at like one or two (no more than that) moments I did feel like it wasn't paced incredibly. Again, no biggie though. All in all, I most definitely had a great time with this and would certainly recommend it.*\r\n\r\n*still, if you want an even greater film set entirely on a train then you gotta check out the outstanding <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/source-code/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source Code</a>'</em> - one of my favourites!", "A well-timed, funny, action packed train ride, I was not bored for a single second of this film.", "This was a fund movie indeed, and quite woke-free at that.

The movie mixes action, comedy, a bit of suspense and a fair amount of gore in a quite enjoyable package.\r\n\r\nThe movie balances the comedy bits right on the line where it would turn silly and cringe-worthy but there was really only one place where I went \u201cOh no, what the f\u2026?\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe action bits are overall quite good but this is Hollywood with their armada of clueless script writers so sometimes they get a bit ridiculous. Like being able to hang on to the outside of a bullet train while it speeds away.\r\n\r\nAlthough fairly unbelievable and over the top, the core story actually makes some sense but then, it was not written by some Hollywood hack but instead based on a novel.\r\n\r\nOverall it was a fun movie with a lot of laughs. The end twist with the tangerine truck was absolutely hilarious.", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\nIt takes a lot for a film to surprise me, and I love it when one does. \u201cBullet Train\u201d is chocked full of so much stylish, bloody, violent fun that it reminds me why I love movies in the first place. Director David Leitch brings a confident, creative vision to his Guy Ritchie-meets-Gareth Evans-meets Matthew Vaughn-meets Quentin Tarantino style that\u2019s rambunctious, frenzied, and in your face. While some will detest this sort of mayhem, many fans of the genre will join me in enthusiastically screaming, \u201cshoot this into my veins!\u201c\r\n\r\nUnlucky assassin Ladybug (Brad Pitt) is tired of the brutality. He\u2019s back for another job, but has pledged to work peacefully and without a weapon. Ladybug has been tasked with retrieving a silver briefcase from a high-speed train in Japan, which seems simple enough. Fate steps in, naturally, putting a damper on his well-intentioned plans. The train is filled with the most lethal adversaries (and one deadly snake) from around the globe, and they all want the same thing. Chaos ensues in what may be a literal last man standing scenario.\r\n\r\nBased on the book by K\u00f4tar\u00f4 Isaka, the film takes place almost solely onboard a train, but it never feels claustrophobic. Despite tight close-ups and many dialogue-heavy scenes with questionable writing, the cast (including Joey King, Andrew Koji, Michael Shannon, and Hiroyuki Sanada) keeps things engaging. Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a pair of professional criminals are particularly entertaining, and Pitt exercises his movie star chops with great aplomb. The storytelling is terrific (one of my favorite bits is the tale of Wolf, which is wonderfully executed), even if everything doesn\u2019t quite come together as well as it could.\r\n\r\nThis is also a gorgeous looking film. Jonathan Sela\u2018s colorful cinematography is alluring, with a richness that elevates every scene. Leitch is skilled at directing action scenes that are thrilling, and fights that are well choreographed. Even the CGI is exciting.\r\n\r\nThe film reaches just the right balance between action, violence, and humor, and it\u2019s one that I cannot wait to revisit. From the killer soundtrack to the rapid-fire visual storytelling, there\u2019s a lot going on at all times. If you\u2019re not paying attention, you\u2019re guaranteed to miss something. I feel this one could benefit from subsequent viewings. Plus, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve wanted to rush back to re-watch a movie the second it ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cBullet Train\u201d is a film that will prove to be an acquired taste. It\u2019s the type of movie that you\u2019ll either love or loathe, with very few landing somewhere in between. It\u2019s illogical, confrontational, and it\u2019s sometimes evident that the film trying too hard, but I found it easy to overlook the flaws because it\u2019s just so damn entertaining. Talk about a nonstop thrill ride.", "_The Invitation_ started off so well, but eventually morphed into a generic film that I could have predicted from a mile away. The set up to the movie was decent, but the second act was when I really thought this movie nailed it. I really enjoyed the somewhat sadistic back and forth between the two leads. On one hand, you see a woman ready to give herself over to the thought of love for the first time. While on the other hand, the audience knows this chance at love is built on a lie. Despite this fact, I found the chemistry incredibly strong between the two leads. I was smiling as their love story progressed, even though I knew it was not going to end well. Nathalie Emmanuel and Thomas Doherty do such an excellent job in this film. I loved their chemistry and Dohery does such a great Jekyll and Hyde with the unearthly vampire masked by the charismatic lord. Super entertaining watching them do great work here.\r\n\r\nThe creepy disturbing nature of the trailers was not overly present here, almost all of the unsettling imagery was used for the trailers and leaves the rest of the movie feeling pretty generic. This is even more evident when the movie turns into a vampire action flick reminiscent of the Twilight movies. At this moment, I was completely ripped out of the movie and was ready for it to end. This drastic change in tone really did not fit well here for me. Even though the last quarter was a disappointment, there is still good elements to the movie that is worth watching for those that were initially interested.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _55%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Average_", "This is just the gift that keeps on giving...

The thrust here (and there is far less actual thrusting in this film than in the others) seems to be to prove that the young lovers are maturing; they are beginning to realise that they are more two peas in a pod than we might have originally considered. This also develops the roles of the parents - especially \"Trish\" (Louise Lombard) and \"Ken\" (Rob Estes) as we discover they have plenty of demons of their own, and so frankly it is no real wonder that the weans have grown up quite so dysfunctional. It is hard to know just quite who this film is for. The story is all over the place, the melodrama weak and implausible and the characterisations become less and less engaging as this tiresome and frankly rather boring franchise drags all of their unwanted dirty washing onto the screen. It is also quite difficult to know whom this is relevant too or for, and HFT is as wooden as a board throughout.

It is so interesting to be so emotionally connected to the killer but yet disturbed by the actions they take as well. I just cannot get over how good this movie is!

The filmmaker's lack of restraint may be a trigger for some, but the impact of his messages couldn't be more memorable.\r\n\r\nBring tissues.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "The Whale is a heart breaking story of our main character, Charlie (Brendon Fraser), as he tries to make amends for abandoning his daughter. Charlie is obese, an ailment that has manifested itself as a coping mechanism for a life of regret. In every scene and interaction this regret is worn by Charlie as a cloak of his past that will stay with him until his dying breath. This character is an immense undertaking and Brendon Fraser plays him perfectly. The emotion he delivers is palpable, which lends itself so seamlessly to scenes of raw sadness and despair. Not only is Fraser a highlight, but the entire supporting cast does an excellent job. Hong Chau is superb, and despite her tough, no nonsense, science focused exterior hides a deep and genuine connection with Charlie. She is incredibly hurt by the way he is treating his body, but is defenseless to his desires, resulting in her to continually feed his addiction. It is a brutal back and forth that is tackled with immense care. Sadie Sink is great as well, she is delivers a brutal performance that leaves the character of Ellie easily hatable with very little redeemable qualities. I understand that this was the point of her character, and by no means is this a knock on Sink's performance, but it felt like a bit much. She was too cruel, to the point of unbelievability, which took a bit away from the message that was trying to be delivered. The pace was a bit slow for my liking. I felt as if the Thomas subplot was a bit pointless and could have been cut from the movie with no ill effects. But despite my minor complaints, the movie is carried by fantastic performances, amazing cinematography and intense emotions that will leave many viewers pleased with their experience, but will not be for everyone.\r\n\r\nScore: 82%\r\nVerdict: Great", "I doubt I can add much more to what has already been said about <em>'The Whale'</em>, but in a word: Bravo!\r\n\r\nBrendan Fraser truly is sensational in this role. I heard about all the acclaim and seen a few of the standing ovations he has received and all I can say is that it is unequivocally deserved. Truly outstanding from the first scene (yes, even with that... ha) to the very last. It's great to see the dude that I first saw as a kid in <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/george-of-the-jungle/\">George of the Jungle</a>'</em> well and truly back in the game.\r\n\r\nOne thing about Fraser getting all the (undoubtedly merited) plaudits from this Darren Aronofsky flick is that I didn't know what to expect from the support cast, and man are there some absolutely stellar performances behind Fraser. Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton are top notch, though Hong Chau is a cut above that trio - brilliant stuff from her!\r\n\r\nThere are some powerful scenes in there. I'm not one to cry with fictional works (my brain automatically knows it's 'fake', I can't help it) but man even I got major goosebumps and gut punches (pardon the pun?) from what's portrayed onscreen. Fraser, and Chau, are naturally the major reasons for that, but everyone - on and off the screen - deserves big props for this 2022 film.\r\n\r\nThe definition of a must-watch.", "I like this one.\r\nIt really made me feel something.", "write something honest\r\n\r\nAny movie directed by Darren Aronofsky contains a lot of violent scenes that are unfamiliar and hard on the eyes to see. Darren Aronofsky is a director whose work must be eagerly awaited because one of his films, Requiem of Dream 2000, is one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nThe most important event in the movie The Whale is the star Brendan Fraser, after suffering from many health problems, especially with the spine, and was forced to perform surgeries, in addition to the withdrawal of lights and fame from him, and his playing movie roles that didn't achieve wide success.\r\n\r\nBrendan Fraser played a terrible role that deserves an Academy Award due to his genius performance, and you do not expect this wonderful acting performance from him, especially since he is an actor who is very good at comedy roles. He did a lot of dramatic work, but he didn't reach perfection like the one in the movie The Whale.\r\n\r\nThis amazing drama was like a oneman show although the other actors did well but the main reason for my admiration for the movie is Brendan Fraser. It was the make-up and the way the breathing was unbelievable and it's mind blowing how someone can pull off such a role\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in only one location, with the exception of the flashback scenes. Sadie Sink It was provocative from the first minutes, getting on your nerves and pushing you to throw something on the visual medium through which you watch the movie, whether it is a mobile phone, a laptop, or even in theaters.\r\n\r\nHong Chau has an incredible charisma and addition to any work, even if she didn't appear much, and I wish to see her in many scenes, she is wonderful.", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n_This film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival_\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about \u201cThe Whale,\u201d I feel it\u2019s important to start at the end rather than the beginning because the melodramatic finale almost ruins everything that\u2019s good about the film. The finale is grossly manipulative, corny, excessive, and if what came before wasn\u2019t so great, it would diminish director Darren Aronofsky\u2019s entire project. Thanks to a heartbreaking script (from writer Samuel D. Hunter) and a once-in-a-lifetime lead performance from Brendan Fraser, it takes little effort to overlook the film\u2019s more negative aspects.\r\n\r\nBased on Hunter\u2019s 2012 play of the same name, the psychological drama tells the story of Charlie (Fraser), a reclusive English professor who is living with severe obesity. Weighing over 600 pounds and unable to leave his home, Charlie spends his days alone in his small, dingy apartment with intermittent visits from his friend and nurse Liz (Hong Chau), who is his only companion. It\u2019s been an interesting week for the man, as he\u2019s had two additional unexpected visitors: a religious missionary (Ty Simpkins) who is compelled to continue his visits, and Charlie\u2019s estranged and hostile teenager daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink). With his health in grave decline (he repeatedly refuses to seek care at a hospital), Charlie decides to do everything in his power to gain one last chance at redemption in his daughter\u2019s eyes, and every ounce of time he has left is spent reconnecting with her.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place in a confined space, and the lead character spends the majority of his time sitting on a sofa. This cramped setting feels suffocating, which in turn conveys the feelings that Charlie is also experiencing. This is a story about empathy, and it\u2019s admittedly challenging at first glance to feel a ton of compassion for Charlie no matter how accepting you may think you are or claim to be. His outward appearance is shocking and repellant, and it\u2019s part of human nature to look at him as if he were a freak show attraction. What\u2019s interesting about the film is that it digs deeper beneath Charlie\u2019s obesity and lets you into his heart. I was surprised to find by the end of the story just how much I had grown to care so deeply for him.\r\n\r\nFolks who have seen the film and are crying that it is \u201cfat shaming\u201d are missing the point. This isn\u2019t a story about humiliation or degradation, it\u2019s a film about actually seeing the person inside a repulsive exterior and giving them humanity. This is not a project that mocks obesity, as has so often (and sadly) been the case with many Hollywood films. This is a story with substantial and challenging themes about depression, mental illness, and addiction. In this case, Charlie has spent years self-medicating his despair and unhappiness with food, and is now suffering from an eating disorder that has raged out of control.\r\n\r\nNone of this would be so emotionally touching if not for Fraser\u2019s lead performance. He is impressive and outstanding as Charlie, and it\u2019s one of the greatest cinematic performances in years (and definitely of the actor\u2019s career). It\u2019s not the spectacle of the makeup or fat suit that makes him memorable: it\u2019s how Fraser thoroughly embodies Charlie with a deep, soulful pain in his eyes. His performance absolutely ripped my heart right out of my chest to the point where I found it difficult to breathe. He\u2019s _that_ good.\r\n\r\nWhile there\u2019s been so much talk about Fraser, Chau\u2019s performance is equally heartbreaking. Through her facial expressions and body language, you can see and feel the pain Charlie is causing Liz. Everyone is simply waiting for the man to die, and you\u2019re right there by Liz\u2019s side as she cares for her best friend in a final act of selfless affection. It\u2019s an agonizing thing to watch and experience, and Chau conveys her torment in an understated, poignant way.\r\n\r\nIf it sounds like this is a tough film to watch, I will assure you that it is. You won\u2019t leave the theater floating on air when it\u2019s over. This is an adult drama that will leave you in tears with its story of resentment, vulnerability, regret, and humanity.

But this quality dips towards the end, with the director focusing more on horror elements in the tune of slasher/home invasion instead of psychological. The sound design is excellent, and the sinister feel really adds to the movie's overall mood. The acting is good, but nothing too spectacular. No performances really blew me away. However, the body horror in the movie is fantastic, and it had the hair on the back of my neck standing up. Even though I do think it is not entirely needed, I have to give props in that department.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the script is pretty dreadful. The message is very in your face, overly complex and did not work for me. It was quite a turn off too, as it seemed as though the director was trying to say all men were the same and were terrible human beings. I know it had deeper meaning than that, but that surface level message is undeniable. I mean honestly, every person she encounters is such a massive piece of shit, not one person would have held out a helping hand? \r\n\r\nSomething that did really bother me was that the movie starts off as a creative psychological horror, but takes a spin in the third act that divulges into body horror mixed with slasher elements, which really takes away from the intriguing first 45 minutes of the film. Combine that with dreadful pacing, which will result in the audience feeling like they're waiting for the movie to be over. \r\n\r\nOverall, Men is a forgettable movie that had potential, but unfortunately, failed to deliver in many aspects.\r\n\r\nScore: 40%\r\nVerdict: Poor", "Say what you will, the original Jeeper's Creepers films, especially the first one, were master classes in budget horror.\r\n\r\nEverything that came after, hasn't lived up to the original.

Produced after the death of his mother Leah Adler and using the fictional family name of the Fabelmans the movie focuses primarily on the iconic film makers family and the impact his parents divorce had on his young life. \u00a0\u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d is rich in \u00a0exposing the influences behind classic movies like E.T. ( Set in a broken home ) and some early techniques at effects the film maker used to better his home movies.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d starts in the 1950\u2019s with Sammy Fabelman experiencing for the first time the magic of cinema with his parents. Slightly traumatised by the movie, particularly a train crash scene, it\u2019s from this emotional experience the first glimpses of becoming a film maker appear. Who of us that have delved into the arts ( film making, actors , singers , performers , etc ) didn\u2019t start off creating these types of home made replicas? \u00a0The idyllic family set up, with the ever growing confident and more adept young home movie maker, \u00a0becomes derailed when after editing his 8mm footage of a family camping trip he discovers all was not as he remembered. \u00a0The impact of what Sam discovers about his concert pianist mother and that fateful trip results in the eventual breakdown of his parents.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs the movie moves into the early 1960\u2019s and Spielberg\u2019s high school years \u201cThe Fabelmans\u201dtouches on religion, race issues and first love. Due to the impact of that fateful camping holiday and therefore following a hiatus of not wanting to make any further home movies, Sam is persuaded by his girlfriend to film the end of school year beach party get together. \u00a0The impact of Sam\u2019s return to film making is clearly visible after the graduation film he produced is shown at the school prom to great acclaim. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d is well documented as being a love letter to cinema but equally it is Spielberg\u2019s love letter to his family. This is the movies key fact, the acceptance of multiple things happening all at once. Vocation is driven by both fear and talent, loving relationships break down, and movies that appear simplistic are highly sophisticated. With an extremely satisfying ending \u201c The Fabelmans\u201d is a beautifully crafted work of art and remarkable insight into one of the most famous and influential directors Hollywood has ever produced", "First of all, let me say that I don't rate movies based on happy ending or bad ending. I rate them by their impact. If movie had an impact on you, if it affected you, this means movie was strong and achieved its goal, doesn't matter if it's a positive or negative impact. And Based on my criteria, this movie is 10/10! This movie actually traumatized me. I have seen a lot of horror movies, but this one affected me a lot, because unlike those paranormal movies about demons, devil and etc, this one is realistic, which means this what happened in this movie, might be happening in real somewhere. And when we - viewers watch movies, we feel for main characters and what I felt for them in this movie was very big pain. It left me very angry and whole night I had last scenes in my mind when I was lying in bed, because I was imagining what if I was in their place... I won't give you a spoiler, but be warned, if you're sensitive person and if you decide to watch it, it will traumatize you. It's a masterpiece, but with a very sad and bad ending.", "Let me start off by saying that I completely understand all of the hate this film is getting, and that's because for the first half of the film I hated it too. For too much of this film, a lot of the characters are just unlikable slobs . . . especially Mel Gibson's character of Bill Long. Also, the story plays out . . . well, it plays out terribly for the first half of the film. It wasn't until later in the film when Stuart Long decides to become a preacher that I was actually invested, and why's that? That's because Long was an absolute piece of trash that I didn't want to watch for the first half of the film. This does not go without saying that by the end I liked Stuart Long's character in the film, but I couldn't like him for the first half.\r\n\r\nThe film isn't precisely terrible, but it isn't good. The third act is solid, but everything in the first act is bad, and the second where Stu is transitioning is mediocre. This does not make for a good film. When the film is simply bad for the first two acts, it can't just make up for it with a good third act, which sucks because the third act was actually not too bad.\r\n\r\nThe entire path of redemption message is interesting, but we've seen it done before, and with much better characters to say the least, but of course, this isn't saying that the path to redemption is bad to watch, but it is still bland and has been done multiple times before.\r\n\r\nIt was nice to see Bill Long become a semi-decent human being at the end of the film, because he realizes he has to now actually care for his son, Stu, but it doesn't really redeem him as a character within the film's boundaries. Also, Bill's character is an absolute D-bag throughout most of the film, so it makes it extremely hard to like him as a character by the end of the film . . . but, boy, if seeing that final dance with his wife wasn't something. . . .\r\n\r\nForgiveness is really what's at the core of \"Father Stu\", but I've already covered that previously. What I'm trying to talk about here is how almost all the characters have something they want to be forgiven for. Bill & Kathleen Long do seem to regret their choices that brought them to this point in their lives, and it's clear that they regret whatever tore them apart. As for Stu, he wants to be forgiven for everything. He regrets just about everything he's done in his life up to this point. The sad part about it is: There's just too much that Stu's done for the audience to really forgive him completely, although it is terrible what happened to him.\r\n\r\nIn my eyes, \"Father Stu\" isn't absolutely terrible, and I do think that it's mediocre at best by the end of the day. The third act is very well done, but because of all the other stuff beforehand it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

But \u2018T\u00c1R\u2019 is 2h38mins of leaving out major plot points and instead showing details in dreadful scenes that often don\u2019t lead anywhere. The viewer has to make all this up for themselves, such as whether T\u00e1r is victim or culprit. In a way, this is all quite well done. Unfortunately, the film is too boring and incomprehensible to care. \r\n\r\nThis being a film about conducting, I found Blanchett\u2019s conducting style ridiculous, though she was good otherwise.

The film is visceral and over the top, celebrating slaughter, in a variety of horrifically novel, ways. \r\n\r\nI personally found the whole affair gratuitous, to be honest. What dwelt at the back of my mind and I feel should be remembered, is war is not a joke or a carnival. \r\n\r\nI grew up surrounded by people who lived and in some cases, served during WWII. The few tales they told were sad, often tragic and spoke of people trapped into a reality, not of their making or their wanting.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, Sisu is well paced, exposition driven and has lots of variety in its action. Acting is solid but exposition, is really this flicks, true driver. On a certain level too, this film, recalls spaghetti Westerns, with a WWII, make over. \r\n\r\nIn summary, if you like splatter style films, you'll probably like this, Just keep in mind, real people lived and died in WWII, on both sides.

If you think Marvel heroes are great, they pale compared to this guy. Or, if you just like watching Nazis get the living shit beat out of them, (I know I do) this is the film to watch.

I had a really good time with the film, Aubrey Plaza is fantastic as the lead, she carried this movie and made it an absolute treat to watch. The story hits on a lot of elements that the resonant with millennials while exploring them in a way that feels genuine. The plot is pretty good, although the main story points are almost all revealed in the trailers, which was a bit disappointing.

Eventually, honest employment seems impossible, so she turns to a more lucrative but more illegal method of income.

Unfortunately, the plot's pacing ebbed and flowed between long sections of an engaging and exciting story and long sections of slower, less interesting content. The title's meaning transformed as the movie progressed and the characters developed, but the final moments just saddened me. The character growth came at the expense of others and kept me from being able to cheer for where everything ended.", "**might contain spoilers**\r\n\r\nWhat a great murder mystery film. As an amateur climber, I too was initially put off by the amount of unprofessional climbing techniques. However, if they were truly climbing/solo enthusiasts, how could they not get injured way before they take on any big challenges? (And from a filmmaking perspective, with climbing being such a popular sports, surly it is not hard to get some random joe from the gym to tell the film crew that those techniques are horrible! also there are other suspicious common-sense defying points later\u2026) The answer of course, what we watched is just simply a **recounting of Becky\u2019s version of what transpired!!!** Then all the inaccuracies makes perfect sense as that\u2019s how you get the authorities to believe why the \u201caccidents\u201d happened in the first place \u2014 sheer negligence and amateur skills!\r\n\r\nI believe what happened was that Becky found out that she was cheated on, then plotted to get rid of the asshat by either screwing with the cam placements and/or - as filmed but with a malignant intent - to get rid of the rope too liberally. And no one else knows exactly how good the cam placements are or whether they were tempered with - Hunter is way above them busy down-climbing!\r\n\r\nThen, this explains perfectly her year-long depression as even if not fully planned out, her imo premeditated actions naturally put herself in even deeper sense of guilt.\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the forever unknowable fact that whether the tower trips is truly initiated by Hunter. Possibly Becky saw Hunter is living a guilt-free life and had another urge for murder and proposed to feed Hunter this great youtube/instagram clickbait trip to convince her to come along! Although the film depicts that Hunter is very heartwarming at times, it\u2019s entirely plausible that Hunter **is** in fact the care-free personality that she demonstrates in **all her videos online!** (which might makes her more murderable in Becky\u2019s eye). So Becky could be using a very high-IQ way of framing her victims as compassionate sweethearts.\r\n\r\nFinally, the biggest telltale sign that the final accident is premeditated (and possibly intended by the filmcrew/writer) is that when Becky lastly went for Hunter\u2019s body to drop down the phone, she **instinctively \u2014 rightfully so for a climber** clipped the carabiner to the lowest stable point which is the as yet unbroken ladder!!!(and the film gave this a real good close-up) Why on earth wouldn\u2019t Hunter do that when she went down to retrieve the bag???!!! This is not just bad climbing, this defies common sense! We were all screaming how stupid it was of Hunter to do what she did in the bag sequence and now we know, **these are all extremely likely fabrications recounted by Becky at the end of the accident!**\r\n\r\nLastly, some keen chinese filmgoers also noted the \u201cmistake\u201d on the poster where in fact **the ladders are failing while Becky\u2019s at the top and Hunter is still climbing!** Maybe this is a hint from the production team ;)\r\n\r\n**welp anyways it\u2019s just a theory :p I probably watched too many asian sope-operas**", "I can\u2019t help having a soft spot for a movie that name-drops several pro wrestlers as a means to convey a nice bit of subtle foreshadowing, and plays Warrants \u00abCherry Pie\u00bb on its soundtrack like every five minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s very difficult to empathize with the characters in this film; anyone who climbs a rusty, super creaky 2,000 foot TV tower (a choice so inane that under normal circumstances it\u2019s known as the Fallacy of the Climbing Villain) in the middle of bumfuck nowhere just for shits and giggles deserves whatever\u2019s coming to them. \r\n\r\nThe rationale, such as it is, behind the protagonists\u2019 actions is that life is \u00abtoo short\u00bb and \u00abyou gotta do something that makes you feel alive.\u00bb Methinks they\u2019re confusing joie de vivre with having a fucking death wish. According to these people\u2019s logic, Bobby De Niro and Chris Walken were really sucking the marrow out of life in those Russian roulette scenes from The Deer Hunter.  \r\n\r\nNow, that climbing artificial structures (known as buildering as well as several other names) is a reckless (not to mention illegal) thing to do doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that those who do it take it lightly. I\u2019m sure a lot of planning and prepping and getting in shape mentally and physically (even the relatively simple act of climbing a ladder becomes a Herculean labor when the ladder is twice as tall as the Eiffel Tower) precedes the actual deed.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t see any of that here; not even a training montage. For Hunter (Virginia Gardner) and Becky (Grace Caroline Currey) it\u2019s an overnight decision; sure, Hunter says she\u2019s has \u00abplanned\u00bb it, and she\u2019s some sort of daredevil You Tuber, but Becky is an out-of-practice rock climber who has ostensibly become a drunken slob in the year since her husband\u2019s Disney Villain Death. \r\n\r\nAll of the above notwithstanding, the film certainly makes the most of its chosen setting. The landscape around the top of the tower (consisting of a \u00abpizza-size platform\u00bb) betrays a green screen quality to it, but this is a rare occasion in which this actually works in the movie\u2019s favor; at such dizzying heights, wouldn\u2019t the world and everything in it look surreal? Or, to put it more bluntly, wouldn\u2019t your perception get all screwed up? \r\n\r\nMoreover, the stunts don\u2019t flat-out take your breath away, but they do kind of borrow it for a little while, which is better than nothing; also, there\u2019s a certain measure of suspense regarding whether or not help is on the way \u2014 and while this is the only movie that I can think of where the audience is left literally waiting for the other shoe to drop, this aspect of the plot actually involves a pretty neat shot of, well, a shoe dropping.", "Going into Fall, I did not have super high hopes, and unfortunately it met my expectations. This movie attempts to be something far greater than it ever needed to be, resulting in a super bloated experience that just feels completely unfocused. The nearly two-hour runtime is entirely too long for a plot that is on the surface, fairly bare bones. But the screenplay attempts to deliver multiple subplots that are supposed to develop our characters, but all it did was take away from the tension that it was building. For every scene where I was gripping my chair waiting to see what will happen next, there is a scene where the two characters talk about their feelings for far too long. Furthermore, there are story elements that are either too convenient or exist solely as obstacles for the sake of obstacles which detract from the overall believability.\r\n\r\nI do think Grace Caroline Currey is going to have a fantastic future in this industry, but her performance alongside Virginia Gardner left a lot to be desired. Currey did her best to save a pretty horrendous script, but it just was not enough. Despite this, the movie was directed fairly well, with great shots of the tower and of the action that was ensuing. The cinematography was fantastic, with beautiful skyboxes and sharp silhouettes of our protagonists that I particularly enjoyed.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this film would have been much better if it had stuck to being a cheesy thriller with a bare bones plot. All the extra filler really weighed down the overall experience.\r\n\r\nScore: 35% \ud83d\udca9\r\nVerdict: Bad", "**Smile\u2019s creepy trailers and clever marketing were the best parts of a movie with a meager plot drenched in uneasy sounds, and way too many jump scares.**\r\n\r\nSmile obsesses over saturating every moment in unsettling dread. The score and sound effects make every moment uneasy and uncomfortable, and not in a good way. Smile\u2019s premise bore many similarities to It Follows with much poorer execution. Smile stumbled from jump scare to jump scare. I started closing my eyes because the jump scares were so predictable, and I was tired of having disturbing images screamed in my face. I will say that Sosie Bacon did an excellent job with what she was given, with her performance being the only bright spot in the film. Unfortunately, the movie was unimpressive and tried to cloak mediocrity in a fountain of jump scares, stressful noises, and unpleasant moments.", "\"Dr. Rose Cotter\" (Sosie Bacon) is a dedicated clinical psychologist who witnesses the gruesome suicide of a young woman in her hospital consulting room. Traumatised, as you might expect, she gradually starts to suffer from unexpected goings on in her own life. Her relationship becomes unstable and soon she appears to have but a tenuous grasp on reality herself. What's going on? Is she doomed to a similar fate? This has something of the \"Azazel\" theory to it, and as the story develops director Parker Finn manages to build quite a degree of mystery and suspense. The malevolence of her haunting spirit is well captured by those working the audio - the sound effects and the score contribute well to the overall feel of this film. The acting though, well I am sorry - I found that to be a terrible let down. Initially, Bacon owned the film but after a few moments she just hadn't the weight to carry the thing in what is, essentially, a one-hander. Her support comes mainly for her ex-boyfriend/cop and all round sceptic about the whole thing \"Joel\" (Kyle Gallner) after her boyfriend \"Trevor\" (Jessie T. Usher) and her own erstwhile psychiatrist played by an indifferent Robin Weigert give up the ghost with her. Sadly, they offer little to add depth to this rather superficial horror effort. There are jump moments, but they lose their potency as this actor fails to capitalise on the tensions being created around her. Perhaps had the story spent less time on her character development, and the pace been tightened up a bit then we might have had less time to worry about that; but the style of the photography with too many lingering images merely serves to sterilise the whole thing for me. I was really disappointed, and after a while just wanted to go watch \"Fallen\" (1998) instead.", "Jebus! \ud83d\ude31 This is the most effective horror experience I've had since The Ring.

If you're horror fan, you should definitely watch this. I suggest you to watch it in the dark, preferably alone. Also, the actress playing the main character does outstanding job. Overall, I'm going to put this movie in my favorite horror movies list. It surely deserves its place there.", "_Barbarian_ is such a twisted and incredibly unique film. Going into this film, I thought I had a pretty good indication of how this was going to go down and was ready for a fun cheesy horror film that follow a pretty generic pattern, but boy was I wrong. Almost the entirety of the trailer was just the first act, and it left me seriously stumped at where this movie was going.\r\nThat sense of unknown really added to the thick tension that this movie brought throughout. There is a paranoia that occurs with both the audience and the main character. You never know who to trust, even if they give you all the indications that they are trustworthy.\r\n\r\nIn today's horror cinema, it is rare to see a movie so reliant on building tension rather than just jump scares galore. Not to say that this film does not have any jump scares, but they are there to enhance and bring a crescendo to the long scenes of tension and dread.\r\n\r\nOverall, the acting was brilliant. Georgina Campbell was fantastic. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd was a bit awkward at times, but I do think that was by choice, as his actor was a kind awkward sweetheart. Justin Long stole the show. His character added a bit of lightness and someone who the audience can really root against.\r\nThe movie does slightly fall of the rails in the third act, it does not take away from the experience that is Barbarian. In fact, I think it almost enhances the film as something truly unique.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _87%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_", "I like Justin Long, he was fantastic in Jeepers Creepers but Barbarian is uninspiring, to say the least. Not that that is the fault of the actors.\r\n\r\nWithout giving too much away, Barbarian feels a little like The Hills Have Eyes, meets Psycho, meets Quasimodo. The problem here is the scripting and handling. Its takes far too long for this story to get off the ground, it has weird, nonsensical plot holes and the reveal comes far to early. \r\n\r\nWhats left almost feels like a second film. It leaves only a reiteration of the essential earlier plot line with a few wrinkles, as the film moves towards its rather icky, conclusion.\r\n\r\nOf course, any sense of fear and tension, built up subtly in the first part of the film, is dissipated too. You know what's coming.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this film feels like it borrows from other horror flicks, in the worst possible way, leading to a disjointed but predictable viewing experience that's neither all that scary or even terribly interesting. The only thing propping it up, is the acting, which is of a high standard.

The world of Na&#39;vi has changed and is once again in danger. Man is the cause of evil as in reality. We are destroying our planet that used to be our Pandora. Pandora is our home, we are Pandora. The houses of the Na&#39;vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry. I recommend viewing in 3D for those who have already seen the previous film and were fascinated by that amazing world and the protagonist&#39;s love and life story.", "**My rating: 10/10**\r\nWhy? I rate any movie based on a few things. Warning! Potential Spoilers.\r\n\r\n**1. Story**. Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.\r\n\r\nThe story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don\u2019t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don\u2019t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro).\r\n\r\n**2. Characters**. Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.\r\nSpidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can\u2019t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin\u2019 Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. \r\n\r\n**3. Acting**. Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri\u2019s \u201cgone nuts\u201d scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don\u2019t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age.\r\n\r\n**4. Everything tied together**. A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle.  Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. I don\u2019t need to say more.", "State-of-the-art special effects, revolutionary underwater cameras, and the resurrection of what is otherwise a mostly forgotten movie theater format can\u2019t hide the fact that _Avatar: The Way of Water_ is basically the same movie as the original with more blue people (some are slightly green now!) that get on your last nerve.

Proud knowing that my faith in this film payed off. Proud that this film was indeed epic. Its not a perfect movie and I do have my flaws. But this film gave me about everything I could ask for when it comes to a movie going experience, this deserves to make serious money at the box. James Cameron said in his interviews that he is the ONLY person that could direct an avatar film, and the internets response was \u201cJames\u2026 Chill\u201d, here\u2019s the thing, he was right. I cannot imagine another director doing something like this. Everything you love from Cameron is here, Terminator 2, Titanic, etc. \r\nThis was the best looking movie I\u2019ve ever seen.. and no other film will match this in the future that isn\u2019t an Avatar sequel. The VFX on the characters and creatures was perfect, no problems whatsoever. Sometimes some landscapes might have looked a little off, but the worst looking shot in this movie still looks better then almost every other CGI heavy action film. The underwater sequences  was awe inspiring, I could\u2019ve watched the underwater sequences in this film forever. the amount of work put into the underwater sequences definitely paid off. At first I wasn\u2019t so sure about 48fps, during the first 20 or so minutes, I thought I would be detracted the whole time, but I wasn\u2019t, I adjusted about half an hour in, and was completely emerged into a film like I never have before. \r\nThe action in this movie was insane, the action was always at and 11 out of 10. You felt the scale, the weight, the stakes. \r\nLike I said, this wasn\u2019t a perfect film. When the movie started, I was so sure about how I would feel about this movie. It starts voiceover heavy and with lots of quick cuts as if a lot has been cut from the film within the opening, Im sure there will be an extended cut to this, and I\u2019m curious if it will add to it. The dialogue in the first film was the best, and this film does have stronger dialogue. But there are still a couple scenes where it did feel a little off, but it was mostly with the younger characters. As it wasn\u2019t Constant, it was just like a line here to there every 20 minutes or so. While, I did say that the opening needed a little more to it, there are chucks in the middle that didn\u2019t need to be there, and was just there to be eye candy, but it wasn\u2019t really a big issue with me, Cause it was some of the best eye candy ever put on film.\r\nI\u2019m tired of people complaining about the story to these avatar films, it feels like people put the plot to these movies on a unrealistic standard. The plot here is basic, and yeah, it might feel a little to basic at Times. But I don't really think it was something worth mentioning critically. \r\nOverall, this was a perfectly crafted film with a pretty good script, that provided a theater experience I\u2019ll never forget.\r\n\r\n9.3/10", "_The Gray Man_ has some impressive action sequences, but is such a lackluster film experience overall. Most of the action is bogged down by sloppy editing where a complete absence of proper lighting ruins whatever positives the film had going for it.

Ana de Armas is mostly forgettable apart from shooting tranquilizer darts in guy\u2019s butts and firing a rocket launcher a few times. Tedious and sluggish with punches and kicks and kills that barely satisfy, _The Gray Man_ is a dead on arrival action thriller that squanders potential almost as often as Ryan Gosling chews gum.\r\n\r\n**Full Review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Gray-Man-2022-The-Yawn-Ultimatum", "Well at least this latest Netflix effort gives us some eye candy in the form of the annoyingly ageless Ryan Gosling and a slightly hammy Chris Evans, but the rest of it is derivative even by their standards. We start with a young man being released from prison by \"Fitzroy\" (Tommy Lee Jones) so he can join an elite CIA hit squad. Named \"Six\" (Gosling), his first mission is straight out of the \"Mechanic\" (2011) only it's an erstwhile colleague that he is sent to eradicate. A task that proves remarkably simple but is accomplished not before, luckily for us, he is given a micro chip that illustrates his new boss \"Carmichael\" (an underwhelming Reg\u00e9-Jean Page) is about as crooked as the day is long. There now ensues a series of long \"John Wick\" style combat scenes as try as this hugely well equipped CIA operation does, it simply cannot capture \"Six\". Desperate times call for desperate measures so \"Hansen\" (Evans) is drafted in to finally do the business by kidnapping the easily accessible niece of the now retired TLJ, and using her as leverage he tries a different tack. Wholesale slaughter follows and along the way some lovely buildings in Prague and Croatia become neat piles of rubble; the local citizens are dropping like flies sending those in the CIA PR department into spasms... Well you get the gist. The always over-rated Ana de Armas sports quite a colourful suit at the start, but as usual her contributions are pretty unimpressive; TLJ is nowhere near his best and the thing lurches on towards a really inevitable conclusion that stretched out the thinnest of plots and showed a really disconcerting image of a CIA completely out of control, running rampage - and that scenario isn't remotely plausible. There is plenty of car-chasing, gunfights and pyrotechnic displays but that's nowhere near enough to compensate for a pretty unremarkable script and an amalgam of stories we have seen done better elsewhere, many times before. That said, if you get a chance to see it during it's limited cinema run then I'd give it a go. On television this is just subscription fodder with A-list cows that you will instantly forget.", "Seing this as another run to the mill Netflix release should not keep your hopes up. Netflix is where mediocre goes to congreate to the masses.\r\nWe have another spy action movie amongst us. Last one before this was Kate, that was another bland action-spy movie.\r\nThis offers absolutely NOTHING new to the table. We seen every trick this movie offer before. Over-skilled agents. Clever coreographed fight scenes, Trick tactics, agents with no names, An agency who elimintaes their own agents, expendable kill teams, plenty conspiracies and tons of action.\r\nBut i have to say i enjoy Gosling alone in this one. He plays it cool. Its  just shame that he is backed up with a script littered with clich\u00e9s from start to end.\r\nWe also have Ana De Armas who is fast becoming the new Tom Holland that appears everywhere. An actress that is milked trought the Hollywood system and spewed out to never be heard of again some day.\r\nBut the movie is for sure a worthy popcorn flick with no expetations to give. On a entertainment standpoint it delivers.", "Anyone thinking the CIA is anything other than awful, should in my humble opinion, take a long look at their actual history.\r\n\r\nAnyway, putting aside the predictable effort to set up this nasty little three letter acronym as virtuous, there's not a lot going on here.\r\n\r\nIts your usual rather heavy handed, cruel, cynical, US action flick.\r\n\r\nExposition is polished but then it needs to be, because there's not a lot else on offer that I can see. Suffice to say, instantly watchable and just as forgettable.\r\n\r\nSo if you want simple action and can look past the not so subtle messaging, this is a marginally alright watch.", "What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.\r\n\r\n<em>'Top Gun: Maverick'</em> is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.\r\n\r\nThe story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.\r\n\r\nMonica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little clich\u00e9, though overall I approve.\r\n\r\nA great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/top-gun-maverick-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Top Gun: Maverick is the return of pure, nostalgic blockbusters, instantly becoming one of this year's personal favorites. The best aerial action sequences ever amaze even the highest expectations, not only due to the absolutely insane real stunts but largely because of the flawless contribution of all filmmaking elements.\r\n\r\nThe surprisingly emotional screenplay helps Tom Cruise deliver one of the best performances of his career. Perfect editing is essential to creating such realism, as well as raising the tension levels for one of the best final acts within the respective genre.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, the memorable score loaded with epic tracks makes the theater experience the only way this magnificent work should be seen.\r\n\r\nSuperior to the original in every way.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "A lot of things in this movie do not make sense, like \"why not use F-35?\", \"why didn't cruise missiles target enemy air defence and planes in hangars?\" to name a few. \r\n\r\nThe original movie had some seriousness built into it, the sequel I think is closer to a comic book movie. Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of conservatives reminiscing Reagan years would watch it, that should be enough to make it a hit.\r\n\r\nI think that is also the reason of the high score. To me the movie quality is more of 5 ~ 7 out of 10.\r\n\r\nJust don't think too much when watching it, but I don't think that is too big a problem for the target audience.", "Haven't seen a movie this perfect in decades. It was most obviously written and directed with the audience in mind - no politics, no preaching, no gratuitous sex, no woke, no offensive casting or characters. Brilliant, simplistic screenwriting and thrill rides. The original, if you've seen it, was iconic as it was, and to know it makes the second film here more enjoyable, but even if you're not familiar with the background of the characters it's clearly presented enough to be a stand-alone enjoyable film.", "> Loved this movie.  Even had me guessing to the end.  Seems like every cast member picked to play their role was the only person that could pull it off especially for the song of Goose.  9.9/10 sequel never lived up to original this one did. 10/10", "This is how American movies should be made.\r\n\r\nI have to confess I'd all but given up on Hollywood. The incessant woke indoctrination had led me to the conclusion, the US film industry, had little left to offer and then along came, Top Gun: Maverick.\r\n\r\nA simple, well rendered, military action flick that reinvents the formula for success and doggedly sticks to it. \r\n\r\nEverything about this film is polished. It comfortably updates the 80's original with style, verve and hands down top shelf acting from Tom Cruise and the cast.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of NATO or US exceptionalism but this films such quality, it even had me cheering, irrespective.\r\n\r\nEntertainment as it should be.....\r\n\r\n10/10.", "**Best movie of 2022 so far, and I don\u2019t see what could possibly top it!**\r\n\r\nThis movie is nearly perfect in every way. Top Gun: Maverick is a masterpiece, from the pacing to the acting to the cinematography to the character development to the casting to the writing. I can\u2019t think of a single thing that didn\u2019t blow me away. The intensity and intentionality of the action were magnificent and balanced with heartfelt moments of character growth and story. Tom Cruise\u2019s best movie in a career filled with memorable and exceptional films.", "**Wanna see the real cheesy, very 80s, bloodpumping, blockbuster movie? a movie that can lift your mood without being to complicated? a movie that can make you feel immerse in movie theaters?**\r\n\r\nSay no more fam, cuz i presents you one of my favorite in 2022\r\nTOP GUN MAVERICK\r\n\r\n_**\"Set 30 years after its predecessor, it follows Maverick's return to the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (also known as U.S. Navy-Fighter Weapons School - \"TOPGUN\"), where he must confront his past as he trains a group of younger pilots, among them the son of Maverick's deceased best friend Lieutenant Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw, USN.\"**_\r\n\r\n\u2014Wrathzo\r\n\r\nI never thought, a sequel from 80s hits movie would be exceeding its predecessor. tbh i thought this movie would be suck and will be getting the fate like The Matrix Resurrections and RoboCop remake. But boy i was wrong, this movie is the definition of Awesomeness in Cinema.\r\n\r\nLet me start with the Story. This movie doesnt have any complex story and some of it structure if im looking at it, kinda almost the same as the first one. But is it identical? yes? so it means they just copying it? no. what i mean is Peter Craig did take a few ideas from the first movie for a few scene (i think its a homage for the first movie) but the context has alot more meaning than the first one tbh.\r\n\r\nNow Scoring, Lorne Balfe did great job for remaking the Top Gun Anthem... Damn it feels good hearing that theme again... and also, i want to applause Onerepublic and Lady Gaga for creating such an awesome soundtrack for the movie\r\n\r\nNow lastly for cinematography and visual effect, its probably the first time in my life i got out from IMAX and said \"i paid 10$ dollar for this movie? i feel like i should've paid more. This movie is too good\". The sound design, the real action from fighter jet, the bloodpumping visual. It all works together creating this masterpiece. its been a decade since i feel this immerse on the movie.\r\n\r\n**In conclusion, ill keep this short\r\nThis is the reason why Movie Theatre was created, now go watch it on IMAX. Trust me, you'll never regret it.**", "This was a good movie. It has a pretty generic story, but its filled with a lot of heart and the right music at the right times. It also helps that on the technical side. It crispy clear video and amazing audio keeps you totally immersed.", "Really solid action-thriller with amazing stunts and pulls on the heartstrings without feeling forced. Tom Cruise is great as usual and Miles Teller was fine though didn't feel like he had enough time to shine, but his scenes with Cruise were good. Jennifer Connelly has aged really well and they did nice service for Val Kilmer's Iceman. Really solid, entertaining old fashioned blockbuster. **4.25/5**", "Top Gun: Maverick had a ton of praise when I finally got around to watching it and it did a relatively good job living up to it.\r\n\r\nMy main two complaints from the original have been entirely corrected in it's sequel: cheesy dialogue and terrible shot selection in the aerial sequences. The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.\r\n\r\nThe overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final \"suicide\" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.\r\n\r\nThe performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.\r\n\r\nThis film is a blast, and I really wish I would have made the time to see it in theaters. I really enjoyed this and I am definitely not one who fancies these types of films, but it captured me.\r\n\r\nScore: 87%\r\nVerdict: Excellent", "You're not supposed to like this, very literally.  IMDb will block your reviews of this movie if you praise it.  Amazon (owned by the same company) is fudging the like ratio, and Youtube did the same with the trailer.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense.  It really does.\r\n\r\nMaverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  The white guy isn't evil.  America isn't evil.  It's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.\r\n\r\nFrom start to finish it's just a solid apolitical action movie.\r\n\r\nSo of course you are supposed to hate it, it literally breaks all the rules of modern Hollywood.\r\n\r\nAnd that was why it was the biggest blockbuster of the past few years.  That is why it had returns that would be a mega-bock buster pre-COVID.  It's the type of movie that people actually want to see, which is why it's under attack on certain sites.  You're not supposed to know that people like it and they weren't supposed to make a movie that people wanted to see.\r\n\r\nEverything has to be a propaganda piece.  \r\n\r\nBut you want to know a secret?  If this came out in the 80s it wouldn't have done well.  It's not as good of an action movie as they had back then.  It actually sort of sucks compared to a lot of the classic action movies of this genre.\r\n\r\nBut then it came out in 2022 and the rules have all changed.  Today everything is racist or far left.  So what you have here is a movie that is great... by 2022 standards... simply because it's not the crap that Hollywood is shoving down your throats and demanding that you like.", "He might look good in a white T-shirt but the thing is, as Zac Efron gets older he looks more and more like an automaton. When he was younger, he had a charm about him - now he just looks like his life consists of nothing but the gym, the manscapists and a bath in yesterday's excess kale smoothie mix! Add to that really lacklustre performance some screaming from a competent youngster in Ryan Kiera Armstrong (\"Charlie\") and we are left with a very mediocre adaptation of this pretty lightweight Stephen King story that is big on pyrotechnic effects, certainly, but on very little else. There is a story: the youngster can cause things to combust at will when she gets stressed or annoyed; her father can bend people to his will making his eyes bleed in the process - quite an effective cure for smokers who want to give up; and her mother - Sidney Lemmon, well she too has a quirk - but I cannot remember what it was (but it definitely wasn't firefighting). Anyway, those who scientifically enhanced this family are hot on their trail - and it's all a question of who will prevail. Well it would be if you were still remotely bothered but after half an hour I just wasn't. For a movie about conflagration - it's sadly all a bit of a damp squib.", "Eh, just another pointless remake/re-adaptation, although I don't mind it since the 1984 version wasn't great either. Nothing terrible but not anything special either. Performances were bland and not even the pyrotechnics weren't all that impressive. I guess it's fine to watch for free on Peakcock Premium but even so, you're really not missing anything. **2.25/5**", "**Ironically, this fire never got going\u2014total dud.**\r\n\r\nWhat? How? I didn't expect to be blown away, but I also didn't expect to be bored. I love Blumhouse flicks, and their fresh take on The Invisible Man had my expectations high for their version of Firestarter. Unfortunately, this was as straight to streaming as a movie could feel. Think Push (2009) but much more mediocre.", "_Pearl_ is a great character study that dives deeper in the stakes that an individual will go to attain success. It is unquestionable that the main question people will ask is, does it live up to X? While I do think it is a good film that I thoroughly enjoyed, it does not overtake its predecessor and that is completely okay. They are two entirely different movies but achieve their goals brilliantly.\r\n\r\nThis film is the textbook definition of a slow burn. The movie drags on and continues to provide this eerie tension as the viewer knows what the end result of this tragic film will be, but still remains locked in to see how it will unfold. I really enjoyed the first act, the character introductions were fantastic, and the audience has an instant connection with Pearl. But the second act drags a little more than I would have liked, but by the minute it is getting stale the third comes to pick up the pace and deliver a satisfying conclusion.\r\n\r\nMia Goth is utterly fantastic in this film. There is a solid six-minute monologue of just her acting her ass off. One take, one angle, and somehow, she was able to lock me in completely. She has burst on to the scene with X and Pearl, and I cannot wait to see where her career goes from here.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film is great, but expectations should be had going into it. It is not going to be an action-packed slasher like its predecessor, but those elements are sprinkled in and work well with the overall film. If you enjoyed X, you should definitely watch this.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _81%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Great_", "The only way for this movie to wow you is to give it some respect. Ultimately, this movie is not for everyone and that's okay.\r\n\r\nSimply, Skinamarink is a mood piece. Most people come into the horror genre to mock the stupid decisions of the characters, gawk at the intense gore, or to be thrilled in a safe environment. This movie, however, will leave those viewers with nothing. This movie is for the viewers who want to be enveloped by the liminal mood. It sends them back to their childhood, when they were afraid to walk around their house at night. It sent me back to when I would sneak downstairs to try to watch some cartoons and eat cereal, leaving the house dark and quiet so I don't wake anyone else up.\r\n\r\nMost of this film is a blank screen with VHS-like fuzz that tricks your mind into seeing things that aren't there. The cinematography is brilliant in the way that it always shows you JUST enough that you want to peek around the corner, but you also don't want to. The amount of interpretations of this very simple movie speaks to its density. The symbolism and ambiguity let the mind run wild with theories and explanations.\r\n\r\nIf I were to change one thing, then I would make the movie at least a half hour shorter. It would be way more approachable if it were more like \"The Backrooms\" by Kane Pixels on YouTube. However, I also feel like the length is necessary to fully set the viewer in the mindset to fully enjoy the second half of the film. Thankfully, there is no producer to get in the way of Kyle Edward Ball's genius film making.\r\n\r\nI suggest watching this movie at night with no external noise and no distractions, sitting on the floor of your living room to get the full experience. Give it the respect it deserves. And if you can't get into the mood they expect, then you might as well turn off the TV and watch the empty screen for two hours.", "MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/\r\n\r\n\"The King's Daughter is everything viewers expected: a formulaic, uninteresting story filled with old-fashioned cliches and spine-chilling visual effects - not in a good way.\r\n\r\nNot a single filmmaker and respective creative team deserve to have their work stuck in a seven-year limbo until it's released, let alone due to scheduling and budget issues.

The characters are like pictures of a bad artist, flat and empty. Facial expressions and forms are alien. There is no aesthetic admiration for this attempt at expression in 3d. No grace and beauty. There is no depth and love, an adequate plot. Inappropriate flat humor. A fierce mockery of the innermost. A ridiculous untalented division without a sense of beauty, reminiscent of the very pirated products from the movie. They piled everything up and made an unintelligible dump. A bunch of some defective characters, like that Sonic who talks about the existence of the original Sonic, by the way... They ridiculed the key points, just for fun, quite unreasonably, only comedy is completely out of place here, as are the creators-comedians. And all this, of course, under the sauce \"We love Rescuers\". Well, well... We couldn't do it, in general, for real. In a Disney way. Only that picture was remembered, which hung on the wall of the actor Roquefort. And how wonderful it would be if the whole movie was of this style and with an adequate plot.\r\nFortunately, this is not an original reality that could continue the canon. To understand this substitution, which tried to continue the series, it is enough to see in the film an episode with the participation of Akiva Shaffer, who allegedly filmed the original series in 1990, damn it.

Baz Luhrmann's style theoretically fits the legendary singer's vibrant aura, and the filmmaker's intention is clear.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the frenetic, choppy editing and the restless camera movements rather come off as a messy, confusing, headache-inducing atmosphere instead of elements that elevate the overall piece.

There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography.\r\n\r\nThe Last Wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.\r\n\r\nWith most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that this movie has restored the Shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward.

But here we are.\r\n\r\nAfter an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.\r\n\r\nWhat I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.\r\n\r\nI adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.", "This one sort of slipped through the cracks didn't it?  I mean, it has a very good, very heartwarming story that helps define a character's growth over the length of the plot.  It has a story about hope and sacrifice and struggle.\r\n\r\nIt is a good movie.\r\n\r\nHow does a movie this good get made today?

Where is the nonstop shaming of Straight White Men?  Where is the depiction of half the country as absolute evil?  \r\n\r\nHow can they make a western movie that doesn't shame the west at every possible turn?\r\n\r\nI have absolutely no idea how this could have been made, but what I can say is that it is fantastic, it is moving, it is fun for the whole family and it has a decent nonpolitical message.  The main character is heroic.  This is just... well, this is a movie that doesn't seem like it could possibly be made in today's Hollywood.", "Really good movie better then the first. I loved the beard it was pretty funny looking. The storyline was way better then part one.", "This is a very good movie and can be a difficult one to watch if you know the history as I did, I of course knew where it was going front the beginning and where it would end up.

I don\u2019t even know why.  A few intangible reasons perhaps? Such as not feeling a lot of chemistry between the main characters. Like I say, I am not even sure myself.  It is an excellent movie, but not one that will stick with me as a powerful slice of history like this should, or make me likely to feel I have to watch it again. But yes, do see it once at least.", "It sure has been a long wait for the sequel (7 years to be precise) but I think it's safe to say that the film does not disappoint.

I was not expecting anything positive from it, yet it actually pulls through with a fun time. I'd even say it's the best release from the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nSteve Carell remains a strong lead for these <em>'Despicable Me'</em> projects, as does Pierre Coffin - the voice of the Minions, of course! Taraji P. Henson is an excellent addition, as is Alan Arkin. Michelle Yeoh is good value too, but her character is a bit lame unfortunately - a bit of a waste of Yeoh, to be honest. Elsewhere, animation-wise: quality - very vibrant!\r\n\r\nLastly, how many butt shots is too many butt shots? I counted at least 3, 4 perhaps: 3(?) x Minions and 1 x Gru. I hope this isn't Kyle Balda's version of Quentin Tarantino's <em>thing</em>...", "No character has a name in this, but Clint Eastwood it isn't. Zac Efron is taking a pee out in the desert when he spots an uncommonly large deposit of gold. His pal Anthony Hayes and he try to move it, but it's just too big. Plan? Well Hayes decides to head to the nearest town to try and procure some heavy lifting equipment and leaves Zac to keep watch. Hmmm? Well, anyway Hayes isn't exactly rushing back to his friend who is gradually running out of food, water, having hallucinations, fending off wild dogs and even a rogue Irish women as his grasp on reality starts to slip... Efron is actually not bad as the man who gradually succumbs to despair and dehydration, but the story plods along far too slowly for almost eighty minutes before the last ten minutes provide a denouement with a bit of a twist to the tale. It is good that Efron is pushing himself away from his pretty boy roles - indeed the make-up folks here do such a good job that I doubt even a biblical leper would welcome him into their home, but the story all takes way too long to get going and the it, quite literally, crawls along. The production does look good - the desert photography has an almost naturally sepia colour to it that emphasises just how hostile this terrain is and the narrative does say something about the degree to which greed is hard wired into our psyche though; and the perils we will endure or permit to obtain wealth. Thought provoking? Maybe, but it's still really quite a wearisome watch and I'm not sure I would bother again.", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/black-adam-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Black Adam is far from impressive, being somewhat disappointing due to its formulaic, predictable screenplay when something different was anticipated.\r\n\r\nLorne Balfe's epic score and a magnificent cast - Dwayne Johnson, Aldis Hodge, and most remarkably Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal - try to elevate the decent action and visuals, but the moderate entertainment levels don't make up for the dated narrative structure.\r\n\r\nTiresomely heavy exposition, story with little to no creativity, and inconsistent humor make it impossible for the DCEU to take \"the next step\" in a truly impactful manner.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C+", "With a horrid script, lackluster performances, and a waste of potentially awesome characters, _Black Adam_ is an explosive, $195 million, anti-heroic dud. The DCEU is about to get way more convoluted and underwhelming than ever before if this is the future of live action DC films.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Black-Adam-20220-Review-A-Stale-and-Disjointed-Antihero-Kerfuffle", "**Black Adam might not reinvent the wheel, but it doesn\u2019t have to. It just wants to take you on a fun, entertaining, exciting superhero ride!**\r\n\r\nBlack Adam has its haters, and I can understand why. It doesn\u2019t necessarily break new ground in the superhero genre, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being awesome! Action-packed from start to finish. The effects are incredible. I kept myself from saying Wow out loud on multiple occasions. Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Black Adam is absolutely ruthless, ripping armies of henchmen with ease and speed. I was worried a PG-13 rating might soften his brutality, but it did not! The action sequences looked amazing and were well done. I really liked the Justice Society characters, although they all felt a little stereotypical with a SpiderMan jokester, a wise old Professor X, and a quipping leader in the vain of Wolverine or Deadshot. Pierce Brosnan was perfect at Dr. Fate, making me wish he hadn\u2019t been relegated to special guest star status. The movie didn\u2019t waste a ton of time giving background on each character which was wise with so many new heroes on screen. The film had its moments of cheese but didn\u2019t overdo it. Definitely watch the mid-credit scene. It\u2019s stupendous! Black Adam was a fine addition to the superhero genre, and I look forward to what comes next.", "> _\"My powers are not a gift. They're a curse, born out of rage.\"_\r\n\r\nI had a blast watching this in theaters. This was very bombastic, with a lot of cool action, but also telling a heartfelt story about Black Adam.\r\n\r\nIt was very inventive how they depicted Black Adam's origin, keeping it a mystery up near the end. Dwayne Johnson was born to play Black Adam. He steals every scene he's in playing a badass anto-hero.\r\n\r\nNow the Justice Society, while they didn't have a backstory in the film, they each had prequel comics detailing their backstory. Which I really dig, these comics are meant to sell comics, after all. Might as well get the audience to buy the comics to get into some great stories (they are also currently doing this with The Flash). The movie actually starts right where the Doctor Fate prequel comic ends, so I don't think it's apographa. Doctor Fate played by Pierce Brosnan was a standout. He really put his all into this character. Aldis Hodge was also a standout as Hawkman.\r\n\r\nThe surprise villain of Black Adam, Sabbac, was a really good addition to the Shazam! mythos. If the wizards have their own champion, why doesn't the seven deadly sins have one? Sabbac is the answer to that. Doctor Fate's battle with him was really cool.\r\n\r\nOverall, this wasn't as bad as the critics were saying, I had a fun time! Be sure to stay for the mid-credits scene!", "cool movie", "_Black Adam_ is in every aspect a generic superhero movie. There is nothing that really separates this for me, besides the body count that Black Adam stacks up during the film.\r\n\r\nOne thing I need to mention is the audio quality. So many lines of dialogue sound like they were recorded straight off from a cell phone. They do not match the scene at all and it was incredibly jarring throughout the entirety of the film. While I am talking about sound, in almost every fight scene the film included a badass rap song. It was cool the first time, but it got old and corny fast.\r\n\r\nThe plot was very generic from all aspects. It suffers by trying to catch the audience up in the first act. The film introduces the Justice Society and Black Adam and quickly accelerates the plot to start the main conflict of the film. It felt rushed and the conflict between the JSA and Black Adam was forced, nothing about it felt genuine. The villian in this movie was so forgettable, by the time he is introduced the conflict is over. I had zero emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. The dialogue was pretty bad as well, the scenes constantly switched from serious to comedy causing both aspects to fall flat for me.\r\n\r\nThe performances were okay, everyone was pretty average including Dwayne Johnson. Nothing spectacular and nothing bad enough for me to notice.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was excited for this new phase and direction of the DCEU and was left disappointed. Definitely one of the poorer movies in the franchise.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _48%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Average_", "Very Good Movie", "I enjoyed the action mainly sometimes the shotty CGI took me out of it. Very surprised that a triple A title in this age would have subpar CGI at times. The story was ok, but most of the dialog was poorly written. Especially with 5he scenes the boy was in. On the tech side the video is crispy clear. Just gorgeous. And the audio is also great. There is a lot going on.", "The worst ever movie I've ever seen.", "Black Adam feels dated. And not like it came out at the dawn of superhero movies. Before that. Like it came out during TMNT II: Secrets of the Ooze.", "OK, this isn't a bad movie.  \r\n\r\nBut, it as a bit much CGI (like everything else nowadays) and I think modern audiences are getting tired of paying out the wazoo to basically watch a video game.\r\n\r\nAnd then the narration.  The voice is too young and though it does make sense with the plot, it is jarring because basic tradition is that narrations have an older and wiser voice... Morgan Freeman, Spock, etc.  So that is going to instantly set the radiance off.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Snyderverse is over.  Period.  They made no illusions about that, we have known it was over for years, there was even a massive backlash about his cut of Justice League because it was given the fans what they wanted and thus bad... because politics and politics have declared that people that are enthusiastic about anything that isn't left wing politics are evil.\r\n\r\nBecause the world has gone insane.\r\n\r\nBut the greater point is that people already don't care.  They not only already don't care, but they were sort of told not to by the very people that made the movie.  \r\n\r\nIt's world is over.  This world ended before it was released.\r\n\r\nWhich, sucks, because Shazam was my favorite to come out of the DCEU.\r\n\r\nPeople aren't going to care.  They aren't going to watch it and when they do it's going to come with disdain.\r\n\r\nBut as far as a Superhero movie goes... come on, you're not really getting much.  They aren't Chinatown, they are just popcorn munchers and nothing more, and that isn't bad.  But let's call it what it is.\r\n\r\nUnless they are political like the MCU, they are just mindless action and gags.  And if they are political like the MCU, they sort of stink.\r\n\r\nThis is relatively politics free.  It's high on adventure and so-so on action (see the above CGI comment) so you have a decent film for the genre. It just should have come out before they declared the universe dead.", "I quite enjoyed this movie. Given the story (some superhero wakes up 5000 year later) I was a bit afraid that it would be a lot of unintelligent Hollywood slapstick humor with Black Adam trying to adapt to modern society. There where a little bit of that but, luckily, not too much.\r\n\r\nI did actually have some hopes for this movie given that those woke intellectual midgets that the rubbish site Rotten Tomatoes calls critics gave it a rotten rating whereas the actual audience gave it a near 90% fresh rating.\r\n\r\nOverall it is a decent story without too many ludicrous elements in it. It works pretty well from start to finish.\r\n\r\nThe Rock is, well, he is The Rock which is good. He did play a more serious character in this movie than he has done in many of his movies though. Pierce Brosnan (I actually didn\u2019t recognize him at first) worked very well as Dr Fate. The rest of the characters was okay but nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nIt is a superhero movie so of course there were plenty of special effects, CGI and action. That is really the main reason to watch these movies and I enjoyed every moment of it. Especially when Black Adams let loose.\r\n\r\nThe action is sometimes quite violent actually with limbs and heads flying. I don\u2019t mind at all. There are way too many movies that some Hollywood bean counter has forced the producers/directors to ruin because they thought it would appeal to a larger audience. Well, then pick a story that is made for that audience you stupid morons.\r\n\r\nAs usual the mid credits scene hinted that there would be more movies with Black Adams and, as long as they keep The Rock as Black Adams in them I can certainly see myself watch more Black Adams.", "sketched, never completed\r\n\r\nLooks like the director/writer had some notes, and didn't get around to write a complete script. So the movie starts out very promising, but then gradually runs out of ideas, until the last half is just ticking off the boxes of expected items.\r\n\r\nThe quirky, funny look into modelling is followed by a well cast and (in some moments) acted part about relationship issues between inexperienced, clueless, and selfish people. \r\nWe learn that the na\u00efve male model is actually in love, while his female model/influencer counterpart tells him he's nice entertainment until she finds a rich guy to be trophy wife for. This doesn't deter him... and that was the promising bit. \r\n\r\nNext, they are on a luxury yacht for the decadents; and there is still potential for a really good story: the upstairs/downstairs angle is only implemented in a few scenes, most screen time of this part is spent on lavish dining with icky \"haute cuisine\" food in rough seas, and the consequences thereof.\r\n\r\nThat was when the really good part could've started: how to they meet or avoid gazes the next day, the day after? What has changed, how, what shouldn't and how do class barriers break?\r\n\r\nInstead, we get a clownish intermezzo and next, the boring island section. This part is just tedious agitprop, reducing the (already shallow) characters to templates, and doing all the expected bits. Waste of time, talent, and a nice beach.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason, people are so content with half-baked products these days, you can even win prizes this way. 5/10, there's better ways to waste time, but this isn't the worst either.", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n\r\nWriter / director Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2018s wickedly sharp black comedy \u201cTriangle of Sadness\u201d offers a biting satire of everything from gender roles, capitalist society, corruption of power, modern masculinity, and the social hierarchies that result from a system that encourages class division. The film has a lot to say and does it well, wading through layers of stinging dialogue, sophisticated observations, and lots and lots of vomit.\r\n\r\nThe film is a lot more than its now-infamous fifteen minute puking scene, however. It\u2019s an in-your-face story that doesn\u2019t shy away from confronting everything from the rampant abuse of the less privileged to the primitive savagery of human nature.\r\n\r\nInstagram influencers and celebrity model couple Carl (Harris Dickinson) and Yaya (Charlbi Dean) are invited on an all-expenses-paid vacation on a luxury cruise in exchange for expert promotion on social media. The ritzy yacht is frequented by ultra-rich passengers who demand the finest things in life (one of the early scenes features a helicopter air-dropping a couple of jars of Nutella in the ocean, which is hilarious because it\u2019s so ridiculous).\r\n\r\nAs Carl and Yaya settle in, they begin to meet their very wealthy fellow guests, including a couple of British arms dealers, a Russian oligarch (Zlatko Buric), and an unhinged Marxist boat captain (Woody Harrelson) who spends the majority of the cruise drunk and locked in his cabin. If not a recipe for disaster, it certainly sets the stage for an interesting few days at sea. But after the ship encounters a vicious storm and capsizes, the handful of survivors are left stranded on a deserted island and fighting for survival.\r\n\r\nThe film has a lot to say about feminism, sexism, today\u2019s social-media obsessed society, the gross exploitation of the working class, the conflicts between the haves and have-nots, the shallowness of the fashion industry, and lots more.\r\n\r\nWhile it would\u2019ve been the easier route to demonize the billionaires in his story, \u00d6stlund instead chooses to make them appropriately ostentatious yet still kind of likeable. They\u2019re not entirely jackasses, they\u2019re just mega-wealthy. Setting the film on a cruise ship is brilliant too, as they have a built-in class system between passengers and amongst the crew. The boat symbolizes the hierarchy of social classes, including the officers, the predominantly white \u201cface time\u201d staff, and the lower rungs that include the cooks, engineers, janitorial workers, and other people of color. It\u2019s satisfying to watch the pecking order not only completely dissolve but get turned upside down after the yacht sinks. That\u2019s when the working class takes over, because they\u2019re the ones who know how to get stuff done.\r\n\r\nThe film offers shrewd observations and a critique of class and privilege, culminating in a third act that delivers a bountiful amount of schadenfreude. The best is the story of \u201ctoilet worker\u201d Abigal (Dolly De Leon, who gives the film\u2019s standout performance), a woman who quickly takes command on the deserted island because she is the only person with any sort of survival skills. After starting a fire, catching fish, and handling the distribution of the small amount of supplies left on the lifeboat, she demands that everyone refer to her as \u201cCaptain.\u201d She even begins trading food for sexual favors with Carl.\r\n\r\n\u00d6stlund\u2019s film about a cruise from hell is an achievement in satire that effortlessly skewers many timely subjects. He sets his eyes squarely on deserved targets and dismantles them with wit and sophistication, making \u201cTriangle of Sadness\u201d one of the smartest and most interesting films of the year.", "It is a shame that Devotion was somewhat overshadowed with another somewhat popular aviator movie this year... but, it separates itself with a more grounded and dramatic approach.\r\n\r\nDevotion follows the first Black aviator, Jessie Brown, (Jonathan Majors) and his friendship with fellow pilot Tom Hudner, (Glen Powell). At first, the two are at odds with each other, trying to gauge what type of man they were. Overtime the two grow an incredible bond that is extremely genuine as they persevere the struggles of the war and the constant racism Brown endures.\r\n\r\nThe main relationship of this movie worked incredibly well, the chemistry between Majors and Powell was infectious. Hudner displays a genuine desire to be a good person and stand up for Brown, but his naiveness gets in his way as he does not see his actions are causing more harm than good. This film does a great job of portraying the nuances of racism, some old and some that still are relevant today. It did so very soft handed and as a backdrop of the film, which worked well in delivering the main narrative of this emotional story.\r\n\r\nI would have to argue that the action in this film is almost better than Top Gun: Maverick. Almost every action scene is in combat with enemy fighters and anti-air tanks, as opposed to training sessions and montages. This creates a much more tense experience as at any second our main characters could get shot down or killed. The high stakes mixed with great cinematography created a very riveting action experience.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a really great time with this film. It is great balance of action and drama with an ending that brought tears to my eye.\r\n\r\nScore: 79%\r\nVerdict: Great", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/jurassic-world-dominion-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Jurassic World Dominion is a massive disappointment on virtually every level.

There are a few action sequences that are worthwhile and Jeff Goldblum has a few great one-liners (\u201cYou made a promise to a dinosaur?\u201d), but the film is a monumental disappointment overall.\r\n\r\nThe film has already made over $415 million at the worldwide box office, so the interest in the franchise is still there. But the chemistry between the cast is almost non-existent and it feels like the film is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel. If the _Jurassic Park/Jurassic World_ franchise is to continue, it desperately needs to go in a refreshing and unseen direction. Now that all of the nostalgia is out of the way, fans deserve a refreshing and unique adventure over what is otherwise a glorified rehash.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Jurassic-World-Dominion-2022-Review-You-Cant-Squeeze-Fun-From-a-Fossil", "Wow.

I didn't like Lost Kingdom very much but at least it was entertainingly dumb. **1.25/5**", "Well, the dinosaur special effects are quite decent. Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.\r\n\r\nI really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen \u201cbig companies are bad\u201d story with dinosaurs thrown in.\r\n\r\nThe story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack. Things more or less just happen and the \u201cheroes\u201d fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the \u201cheroes\u201d doesn\u2019t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?\r\n\r\nIdiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.\r\n\r\nThey brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.\r\n\r\nIt is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today\u2019s Hollywood morons. I\u2019ve been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real, life like dinosaurs it was just wow. But now, not even the special effects can save this movie. It is not a good movie, plain and simple.", "Jurassic World Dominion fails to impress as a dinosaur movie, as the plot seems to be a poor choice. The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus, giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise. Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story. Chris Pratt's character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading character.\r\n\r\nThe camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy, with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion, especially in fast-paced scenes like the one in Malta. The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing, with the country portrayed as a dirty, third-world Arabic nation covered in desert sand, which is not an accurate representation of the country. The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOverall, Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a well-planned and executed story. It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies. Although the movie is not a complete disaster, it falls short of being an enjoyable watch. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the length of the movie seems to be excessive, and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audience's attention. The story's predictability adds to the monotony, leaving little to surprise or engage the viewers.\r\n\r\nAs if to acknowledge the franchise's overreliance on gimmicks and sequels, Ian Malcolm's line, \"Jurassic World? Not a fan,\" serves as a meta-commentary on the movie itself. It is a nod to the fans who have been disappointed by the franchise's recent offerings, and unfortunately, Jurassic World Dominion does little to change that sentiment. 5/10", "The course of the modern series of Jurassic Park films has become completely different from the old series, lost in the wind and far from the path of success.

The entire cast was powerful, vicious, strong, and exciting. The action explodes right out the gate and feels so raw, with the jujitsu, Kali, and Chinese Wushu all blending with the machete and spear fighting to feel like the sword version of John Wick's gun-fu. Viola Davis' steely strong portrayal of Nanisca delivers a mighty yet caring warrior general, creating the genuine and dynamic atmosphere of the film. The entire cast gave stellar performances, but the stand out was Lashana Lynch as Izogie. Lynch was as over-powering, unstoppable, and skilled as any warrior in the film while also serving as the heart, humor, and strength of her Agojie sisters. The film was a fantastic adventure epic but lagged a little in the middle as it focused solely on character development and exposition.

It was intentionally polarizing.  Rational people are ripping into it because they turned a power hungry monster responsible for the slave trade and a fair amount of ethnic cleansing into an anti-slavery hero.  It was a monumental rewrite of history from start to finish, one so extreme you can't even give it the excuse of artistic license. \r\n\r\nAnd it was intentional, there were a lot of other people that you could make a heroic movie about that fit the mold they were looking for to push meh message.

They don't care that it's a cheap poorly written over-acted political propaganda flick, they are praising the fact that they blatantly and knowingly rewrote history, and then turned around and said \"we don't care, it's rewritten now, we have changed reality and, guess what, all of our goose stepping followers don't care either.\"", "**Bodies Bodies Bodies is filled with neurotic, selfish, and annoying characters that find a way to make a killer in their midst aggravating and tiresome.**\r\n\r\nI spent the entire runtime of Bodies Bodies Bodies wondering why this movie was so well received and highly rated.

The weak dialogue is dreadful to the point of making me wonder if any of it was actually written or just ad-libbed. Unfortunately, once the bodies start dropping, even the mystery of a vicious murderer plays the background to the self-absorbed spoiled brats whining and spilling each other\u2019s secrets. At one point, the story attempts to shoehorn the murderer killing the victims in the order of the game, but even the characters in the movie don\u2019t buy it. The cast does a convincing job of portraying a bunch of immature narcissists reacting to such a high-stress situation. I was so bored and disappointed until the final 3 minutes.

But the movie fails to do that, too - it also burdens us with an unnecessary (and most likely a-historical) love story, and draws out things for long, long, long.\r\nThe battles appear fierce, close up, bloody; if you don't look close, it gives the rough impression of good fighting scenes.\r\n\r\nToo many cliches, too many wide-eyed pained looks from the good lady, and TOO MUCH TIME WASTED.\r\n\r\nThis bit could've been told in a quarter of the time, without skipping anything - and we'd get to see much more of the Czech history (plus more battles, intrigues, and if unavoidable, also love stories).\r\n\r\n**TL;DR: A waste of talent, money, and time.** No need to waste yours, unless you have an lazy time to while away.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: The few token PoC they have to squeeze in these days have been cast as Cumars, plus some vaguely asian-mongolian looking extras.

I am thinking especially of The Girl in the Cafe, where he oddly enough also plays a civil servant.\r\n\r\nNighy is wonderful and methodical (in a good way) as a man who is thawing out from a repetitious, paralyzed life after he receives life-altering news. He even impresses when he sings a song in the same quiet, restrained manner.\r\n\r\nA flashback is applied in an odd way nearer the end of the movie, but it works as an imaginative way to fill in the details of the ending.\r\n\r\nI fully expect to watch this again.", "Chadwick Boseman is undeniably missed, but <em>'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'</em> still manages to produce an entertaining and even touching final chapter of the MCU's Phase Four.\r\n\r\nI had a positive time with this, one good thing about watching it almost two months after release is that I got to watch this in an empty cinema - absolute bliss. Thankfully I managed to avoid all spoilers, though had heard the name Namor bandied about online so that's all I knew coming into it.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Namor, I'm a fan. He makes for a cool new character to the universe, as does Talokan as a whole, with Tenoch Huerta a welcomed addition to the cast - first time I recall seeing him in something, and I'm impressed. The star of this 2022 flick, however, is Letitia Wright. I don't really remember her standing out in the original much, at least to me, but here Wright is excellent.\r\n\r\nAngela Bassett is very good also, there's one emotion-filled speech scene in particular that stands out in my memory. Danai Gurira is always a joy to watch, while Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o are the best of the rest - though, the whole cast are good; even Martin Freeman, who I'm not always convinced by.\r\n\r\nThe film handles Boseman's absence nicely, there are some very touching moments in there. I'd say they went the correct way with the character of T'Challa, no-one would've been able to even closely replicate Boseman.

Wakanda Forever has done an excellent job of embracing that same ideology for the Black people of the world... and claiming it as a sort of pride.\r\n\r\nAnd that, of course, is exemplified by their virtuous victory over the forces of... Latino, who are so overtly masculine, right down to their shameful gendered language (like about 90% of the other languages on the globe) that they had to edit out Namor's bulge in order to... what... show more African Racial Superiority over the Latino population, or maybe just to add corporate feminism to the Black Nationalist message.\r\n\r\nEither way, the statement they made here was clear, Latinos bad, Black Nationalism good...\r\n\r\n...

I do not think any individual part of this film was inherently bad. The performances by Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton were captivating and their on-screen chemistry was amazing. The flash backs to the characters' lives were very fascinating. I really enjoyed exploring the lives of ancient civilizations in the eyes of George Miller. The overarching plot was decent, nothing spectacular. But the collection of all these different elements together just felt like a jumbled mess. The movie never gets in a groove and always feels like it is stumbling its way to the finish line. I felt the opening sequence was incredibly rushed and the audience does not really get to form a connection with Alithea before she unleashes the Djinn, and from there on the audience is whipped back and forth from flashback to present day and it feels incredibly disjointed. The jumbled up second act, deflates any type of momentum going into the third making it fall flat on its head. All this compiled together made a somewhat emotional and touching ending feel hollow and lackluster. Overall, as a collection of short stories this movie was a good time, but really does not belong together in a jumbled-up mess of a plot.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _53%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Average_", "By January 2022, the book had sold 12 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.

And there is a wonderful contrast between a purity of soul living within a world of threat and danger. It was refreshing to have a film celebrate innocence. The nature shots of North Carolina are breathtaking. The casting is spot on and the performances are flawless. But the success of the film lies with the lead actor, Daisy Edgar-Jones (a very talented Brit, who earned respect for her talents in another best selling novel adaptation for television, NORMAL PEOPLE). There is a wide eyed innocence about Kya that she captures which, in turn, captivates the audience to invest in her story and her plight. (The only disconnect I had with her portrayal was not her fault but that of the production. For a swamp girl, living off the grid, her personal hygiene and wardrobe were spotless and fitted to perfection. A seemingly unlikely possibility considering her environment.)

I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed.

No, it's not obvious; at least not to normal people like you and me. Elsa (played by **Hong Chau**) picked up on it, but she isn't like us.

Something you might hear at an actual tasting: A story of life, it's memories (good and bad) told in 5 courses.  If you're part of the menu, you deserve to stay until the end...

There\u2019s no sincerity in his performance even when it seems like he\u2019s being genuine. _The Flash_ is a superhero film that prioritizes silliness with a cheese factor of gargantuan proportions, but no actual entertainment values whatsoever.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/hsalfeht", "_The Flash_. First announced in 2014 and released in mid-2023, it is arguably one of the worst DC movies to this date. Throughout all the problems, the most incomprehensible is certainly how Warner kept allowing such a person as Ezra Miller to be cast as the main role to be the face of a hero. With a budget of $200 million they were able to deliver the worst possible CGI ever seen, and with it a crumbled plot that wishes for more of everything but Flash. \r\n\r\nMichael Keaton has done a brilliant performance within this movie as a throwback to the 89's Batman. And with it, the new addition to the Justice League, Sasha Calle has done a fantastic job as Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), but both get rushed plot points that makes the audience wish for more of their screen time or even a solo movie and not the teenage nuisance that Barry Allen is. One minute, Supergirl rushes out ignoring everything, the other she's at the door regretting her decision and trying to help the rest of the characters. The same can be said about Michael Keaton's character.\r\n\r\nThe movie dives into the concept of time and its dangerous potential, later forgetting everything about it and labeling it \"multiverse\" instead, following Marvel's recent movies like _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_ and _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ and not adding a single spark of creativity with it. But those movies at least have decent scores, the music within this one must have been selected from a random kid's playlist...\r\nThe movie is also 2h 24m long, being completely unnecessary. Various scenes are completly descartable, an action scene at the start was put there with no thought whatsoever and is 15m of wasted narrative that could be used to invest in Supergirl's story (if she is here to stay). Iris West has no reason to be put into the movie. And for some reason they decided to make a bunch of cameos using CGI, and as previously said, that didn't go well.\r\n\r\nIn the end, DC is still the same mess. They can't properly build a plot and create a movie that sustains its own beliefs. Ben Affleck's Batman, at the start, said we can't change our past due to the fact that those key moments that leave scars are the moments that build our foundation and make us who we are. It seems that Barry Allen didn't learn shit from this two-hour journey.", "The Flash utilises a tried and true concept, that of time travel and its paradoxes but doesn't really deliver anything of consequence. \r\n\r\nThis film doesn't deliver for a variety of reasons. To my mind, the foremost is the lead character. The Flash's over cooked dripiness, unfunny, goofy antics and fall flat humour, can't quite \"sell\" the concept of him as a hero. If the films producers and writers, wanted to know how to develop a more accessible lead character, they should have looked at the series. It does a much better job at balancing the characters innate nerdiness, with his other, more heroic, qualities. \r\n\r\nThe second point of failure is essentially re-inventing elements of the story from the series and past films. Flash fans who have watched the series, may well find the film adaptation somewhat repetitive and predictable. Equally recycling large swatches of past films, with tweaks here and there, isn't doing anything that \"new\" either.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only real point of interest is utilising a range of past actors and characters, from the franchise, such as Batman, Superman/woman and Wonder Woman. \r\n\r\nIn summary, not an awful film but still a little unoriginal. An outcome not helped by a rather annoying, lead character. This is balanced by decent action and the presence of other hero's from the franchise. That said, the fact its necessary to drop so many cameo's, is telling in and of, itself.", "Come all, let's witness an amazing adventure of action, adventure and sci-fi in the movie \"The Flash\" which will be released on June 16, 2023 in the United States.

It\u2019s made in such a way that anyone who\u2019s interested in that era and the social upheaval that was going on will appreciate it, similar to \"Forrest Gump\" except with more overt spirituality. For instance, there\u2019s Janis Joplin, Timothy Leary and several iconic songs, e.g. \u201cFree Ride,\u201d \u201cListen to the Music\u201d and \u201cWar.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m somewhat familiar with Greg Laurie and his ministry, I wasn\u2019t aware that he got his start in the Jesus Movement, nor was I familiar with Chuck Smith or Lonnie Frisbee, the latter of whom \u201cbackslid\u201d and died of AIDS at the premature age of 43 in 1993.\r\n\r\nGrammer and Joel Courtney are effective as the main male protagonists, Chuck Smith and Greg Laurie respectively. Meanwhile the lovely Anna Grace Barlow is a winsome revelation as Cathe, Laurie\u2019s potential girlfriend.\r\n\r\nWhile not as inspiring as \"War Room\" (2015), it\u2019s arguably superior to \"Do You Believe?\" (2015), \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead\u201d (2014), \"God's Not Dead 2\" (2016) and \"Overcomer\" (2019).

Fury of the Gods is *almost* saved by the incredibly charismatic, energetic cast, as well as by a truly thrilling third act. Unfortunately, the movie falls into the trap of exaggerating what worked in the original, excessively tackling every narrative aspect, and losing authenticity along the way. Way too long, boringly generic, and lacking a clearer direction, namely in the treatment of its family themes. Comedy is far from the efficiency of its predecessor. I recommend it to the vast majority of fans of the genre, who will certainly enjoy the lightness still present in this sequel.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C", "The movie is decent enough, although formulaic and predictable.  But the 12 year old level humor has long since worn out its welcome.", "I genuinely had a blast with this!\r\n\r\nI also had much fun with the original 2019 <em>'Shazam!'</em> so I guess the aforementioned isn't too much of a surprise, though I actually think this as entertaining in differing ways... and I'd class it as an improvement. The first film is more funny, though the story and characters are more interesting here in my opinion.\r\n\r\nBig fan of the special effects throughout, the whole look of film in general is pleasant and I like how bright it all is for the vast majority; as opposed to the dreary darkness that superhero flicks seemingly tend to bring, especially in the DCEU. The score is excellent, not necessarily one I'd add to my movie soundtrack playlist but with the context of what's onscreen it's great.\r\n\r\nThe cast bring noteworthy performances. I wouldn't actually put anyone as a true standout, naturally Zachary Levi sticks out most but as a bunch of characters I had an enjoyable time watching them all in truth. It's fun seeing Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu in their respective roles, while Rachel Zegler is a positive addition and Djimon Hounsou is pleasing. Jack Dylan Grazer spearheads the rest of them well.\r\n\r\nThe only real criticism I have is a couple of bits of dialogue, namely the product placement ones... that certain sweet brand and its slogan in particular. Otherwise, I can only say I found a lot of enjoyment with <em>'Shazam! Fury of the Gods'</em>... my favourite flick from this universe, though a quick glance at the average rating suggests I should whisper that quietly!", "I guess a plus on this sequel is it is better than the first one. Not that says much as I didn't really care for it, as it was a sludge to sit through, especially the finale. Here, honestly I couldn't really understand what the heck was going on but I suppose some of the direction was interesting and it didn't feel like it dragged on. That said, it is empty on any emotional elements.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I even like \"The Conjuring Universe\" is because of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, even the mediocre \"The Devil Made Me Do It\" was watchable because of them, all of these other entries have been mostly duds. **2.5/5**", "Now I don't know about you, but if I started to get text messages from an unknown number that were emotionally revealing in nature, I think that I would politely inform the sender that they'd got a wrong number! Not so here, when the rather hapless \"Rob\" (Sam Heughan) starts to get messages that certainly tweak his interest, and that of his colleagues \"Lisa\" (Lydia West) and \"Billy\" (Russell Tovey). He is able to glean enough from her texts to eventually engineer a meeting (at the opera) and is soon introduced to \"Mira\" (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) who is still reeling from the death of her previous boyfriend in an auto accident - hence why she still thinks she is talking to him when sending messages to his old, now reallocated, phone number! Meantime, \"Rob\" has been tasked with getting an in-depth interview with the soon-to-tour Celine Dion and after a rather shaky start at a press conference, she decides to help our dippy hero to sort out his rather curiously developing relationship. To be fair to Heughan, he's not your archetypal pretty boy in this film, but that's only of slight benefit as the plot lurches from ridiculous to absurd before concluding in the only way it could (just ninety minutes later than it needed to be). The soundtrack does offer us a chance to recall just how powerful Miss Dion's voice is, but her acting ought to be something she consigns to the back of her sock drawer pretty sharpish - a recommendation that could be made for pretty much the entire cast (and the pretty lame writing, too). The only redeeming scene, I felt anyway, featured an health-obsessed Nick Jonas as her date who, upon realising that he wasn't going to get laid, starts to look for an alternative partner with whom to burn off the carbs from the drinks - while they are still in the cab! Nothing at all to write home about here, it passes the time amiably and forgettably enough but definitely does not need the cinema experience.", "Infinity Pool is a horny, horrifying look at ego and self-indulgence based on self-doubt and failure. The film follows novelist James Foster (Alexander Skarsgard) as he is mesmerized by Gabi (Mia Goth) resulting in a stained week of violence and debauchery. \r\n\r\nThe plot is a story of two halves, the first being incredibly strong as the audience is learning the mystery behind the experiments, guests and their past. Viewers can resonate a ton with Foster's wife as she is constantly neglected and misused by her husband. That is ever apparent in the shot selection as she is constantly out of frame or unfocused. This part really worked for me, but as the story progressed the scope grew too large for its own good. The ending becomes unfocused, resulting in aspects that do not make sense or are incredibly unbelievable in the world that the film has set up.\r\n\r\nThe film has fantastic cinematography though, filled with interesting visuals that create for a very unique and chaotic viewing experience. Every shot is calculated and filmed in an interesting way that creates suspense and uncomfortable feelings.\r\n\r\nThe performances are superb, Mia Goth has found her niche in the \"elevated\" horror genre becoming a modern-day scream queen. Although, after X, Pearl, and now Infinity Pool, I would like to see her do some more diverse work, but she has nailed this type of character. Alexander Skarsgard is also great with some emotionally engrossing scenes mixed with cold, emotionless scenes that create an interesting dichotomy for the characters headspace.\r\n\r\nAlthough the film slightly stumbles towards the end and might have a bit of a bloated run time, there is still a ton to enjoy with a creative story, mind bending cinematography, and powerhouse performances.\r\n\r\nScore: 77%\r\nVerdict: Great", "_Infinity Pool_ is an eccentric sci-fi horror filled with disturbing sex, crazy amounts of ultra-violence, and a sequence where Mia Goth breastfeeds Alexander Skarsgard. It\u2019s super weird and obviously a different type of film that won\u2019t appeal to the typical mainstream blockbuster crowd.\r\n\r\nThe film takes an interesting detour into what defines gluttony and to what extremes humans will undergo in order to feel hungry again when their stomachs are already bloated from overeating. Ambiguously haunting with bloodcurdling sensuality, _Infinity Pool _is not for the squeamish and yet such an impressive and bourgeois bloodbath for those who admire unusually unsettling cinema.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/02/01/infinity-pool-review-replicating-the-sins-of-the-new-flesh/", "Infinity Pool presents a fascinating concept that is both original and intriguing. The movie follows a storyline that is similar to The Purge, but with a twist. In this movie, there are no consequences for the wealthy elite, which is a unique and thought-provoking concept.\r\n\r\nHowever, the movie loses its way quickly, and the storyline becomes too bizarre for its own good. The events that unfold towards the end are confusing, and there seems to be no clear message to take away from them.\r\n\r\nThe actors' performances are commendable, and the production values are excellent. The visual effects and cinematography are well-executed, but unfortunately, they cannot compensate for the muddled and confusing storyline.\r\nOverall, Infinity Pool is an interesting idea, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The movie is too convoluted and lacks a coherent message, leaving the audience feeling unsatisfied. Despite some of its strengths, this movie is ultimately a miss.", "Good movie!", "**John Wick: Chapter 4 is at the peak of action cinema and fight choreography. What the film lacks in story is dramatically overcome with the most stunning action set pieces ever seen.**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-hour runtime, this movie transitions from weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves is incredible in the role, but the supporting cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick\u2019s story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don\u2019t go to a John Wick movie for a deep story. We go for the martial arts and gun-fu, and John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers an unparalleled masterpiece of violence.", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-john-wick-chapter-4-is-a-masterclass-on-action-filmmaking/\r\n\r\n\"John Wick: Chapter 4 concludes the game-changing saga with a relentless, ruthless action masterclass that ultimately justifies its epic length.

Every music was suitable for the stage and very good.\r\n\r\nAction: Although there were exaggerated scenes about action, it was better than all the first 3 movies. In particular, there is an action scene shot from the top. That scene is one of the best I've ever seen in the cinema. You enjoy each scene of the action separately. You have trouble sitting in the chair.\r\n\r\nMovie Duration: Even though the movie is long, you never notice it. It was a very moving movie.\r\n\r\nOverall: This movie is definitely worth watching.

And in the 80s it would have had more of a plot and been a lot better...\r\n\r\n... but in 2023 \"Entertaining and politics free\" makes a movie into a masterpiece.  \r\n\r\nIts wall to wall action, with only about 3% dedicated to plot and the only really thinking it requires you to do is  wonder \"if there are so many assassins in the world, how is it a lucrative profession?\"", "I don\u2019t need to tell you that the violent action in \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d is over the top. If you\u2019re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you\u2019re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren\u2019t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise\u2019s highest body count in its wake.\r\n\r\nAfter being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.\r\n\r\nThis is Reeves\u2019 movie through and through, and he\u2019s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It\u2019s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) breathes fresh life into the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you\u2019re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It\u2019s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.\r\n\r\nDirector Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn\u2019t a film with rapid cutting where you can\u2019t tell what is going on, and it\u2019s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski\u2019s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.\r\n\r\nDespite all of the things that are done right, the film\u2019s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It\u2019s one rousing, wild ride.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "_John Wick: Chapter 4_ is explosive, nunchuck-bashing, bone-crunching cinematic ecstasy that allows action junkies to gorge on a buffet of bullet casings and broken necks.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/03/29/john-wick-chapter-4-review-a-buffet-of-bullet-casings-and-broken-necks/", "John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\r\n\r\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\r\n\r\nScore: 93%\r\nVerdict: Excellent", "**A beautiful woman doesn't mean a beautiful character**\r\n\r\nNinehundredmillion (nearly a **billion!** obviously guarantees beautiful pictures - but does that guarantee a profound movie?

And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta\u2019s third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn\u2019t have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren\u2019t adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren\u2019t explained at all, leaving viewers who aren\u2019t comic book laureates wondering what\u2019s going on (particularly at film\u2019s end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn\u2019t particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture\u2019s pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that\u2019s growing tiresome in the studio\u2019s releases, a development akin to the \u201cPaul is dead\u201d legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there\u2019s the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they\u2019ve been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, \u201cThe Marvels\u201d is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that\u2019s troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren\u2019t to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they\u2019re cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like \u201cWakanda Forever\u201d (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work \u2013 and it\u2019s time to show viewers that.", "A trashtastic conclusion to an epic failure of a series of movies.

Give it a go; easily one of the best movies of this year.", "Aneesh Chaganty made an immediate impact with his 2018 feature debut Searching. While the Google alumnus was not the first to use the screen life format (that is, telling a story only through what we can see on computer screens and digital devices), Chaganty certainly popularized it with a compelling story of a father looking for his missing daughter.\r\n\r\nIn 2023\u2019s Missing, Chaganty produces and gets a \u2018story by\u2019 credit but hands the screenwriting and directing to Will Merrick and Nick Johnson. This spiritual follow-up to Searching again revolves around someone who vanishes. The roles get reversed in Missing, replacing a parent who has to fumble his way around social media as the primary searcher with the very tech-savvy June Allen (Storm Reid), a teen who is looking for her missing mother, Grace (Nia Long).\r\n\r\nWhile Aneesh Chaganty isn\u2019t at the helm this time around, his influence is still very apparent in Missing. We don\u2019t see June all that often, but as in Searching, we get a sense of what the character is feeling when we watch her type a message in a chat box but doesn\u2019t send it, letting the cursor blink for a few moments before erasing the text and typing a revised message that\u2019s more thoughtful. Anyone who has used computers would be able to relate to moments like these where we write off the top of our heads, sometimes in a very emotional state, only to catch ourselves and think better of what we\u2019ve said. In lieu of seeing facial expressions or hearing line readings, this approach to conveying emotion and giving insight into a character\u2019s thoughts is one of the keys to a screen life narrative, giving the story a beating heart when it could easily lean too much into the technical side and become cold and soulless.\r\n\r\nAnother wrinkle that Merrick and Johnson\u2019s film introduces is the lack of money for the protagonist. Being a high schooler, June doesn\u2019t have much in the way of financial resources and is entirely dependent on the money her mother left prior to going down to Colombia on vacation. This presents a challenge when the FBI\u2019s investigation into Grace\u2019s disappearance doesn\u2019t make enough headway for June, forcing her to hire someone down in Colombia to help find clues.\r\n\r\nWith June\u2019s limited funds, she isn\u2019t able to hire a private investigator and is only able to afford the services of Javier (Joaquim de Almeida), an online platform worker. The inclusion of this character grounds the story as Javier is the type of ordinary person one would expect to come across in today\u2019s gig economy. Being a father himself, Javier connects with June, understanding her desperation to locate her missing mother. The burgeoning relationship between Javier and June is one of the highlights of this film, helping to build the emotional resonance that the story needs to keep viewers engaged.\r\n\r\nWith the twists in the narrative and rock-solid performances from Reid and de Almeida, Missing is one of the rare films that manages to equal the trailblazer that came before. Merrick and Johnson\u2019s movie doesn\u2019t have the novelty of Searching, but their take on an online missing person search changes enough elements to make it feel fresh. This film is a great ride and anyone who enjoyed Searching should give it a look.", "I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.\r\n\r\nThe overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.\r\n\r\nThe performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.\r\n\r\nFinally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.\r\n\r\nScore: 52% |\r\nVerdict: Average", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-review\r\n\r\n\"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania warrants the divisive reception. Immersive visuals, more than satisfying action, and absolutely exceptional performances, aside from Kathryn Newton due to lack of direction. Unfortunately, the excessive, repetitive, unnecessary dialogue driven by exposition, along with a lack of stronger tonal balance - fewer jokes by Marvel standard, but the cringe level affects transitions to/from more serious moments - and an underdeveloped narrative devoid of true stakes - character arcs are almost non-existent - make this an overall very inconsistent watch. Still, JONATHAN MAJORS AS KANG! Wow!\"\r\n\r\nRating: C", "A fun one!\r\n\r\nI had a terrific time watching <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'</em>, despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.\r\n\r\nStar of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em>, but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.\r\n\r\nLove the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M.O.D.O.K. is a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nLooking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.", "worst movie. Even that much money - too much btw - for special effects cant hide Reed's lacking effort to build a believable world. It's a poor and passionless visual copy of something like Star Wars Mini... with minimal humor and zero originality. RIP Marvel.", "When it comes to their Marvel properties, there\u2019s this slightly morbid insistence by Disney to tie every teeny tiny detail of previous movies, television shows, and character arcs together in obsessive fashion. It\u2019s becoming such an uncontrollable urge by the studio to engage in this behavior that the cause-and-effect is resulting in disasters like \u201cEternals,\u201d \u201cThor: Love and Thunder,\u201d and now, \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d\r\n\r\nTrying too hard to force a non-story into the already lame Ant-Man mythology, the film reunites superhero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as Ant-Man and the Wasp. The pair find themselves thrust into the dangerous Quantum Realm along with Hope\u2019s parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with Scott\u2019s teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). As they explore the unusual terrain and alien society filled with strange creatures, Janet reveals that she didn\u2019t quite tell the group everything about the three decades she spent trapped in the realm. Facing new dangers from supervillan Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), the family must unite to stop a worldwide disaster.\r\n\r\nVery little about this project feels like a satisfying superhero movie and instead, it\u2019s more like an assemblage of other (and far better) science fiction films. If not for the titanic budget and big-name stars, it could almost be mistaken for a Redbox \u201cmockbuster\u201d of \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cMad Max,\u201d \u201cAvatar,\u201d and \u201cGodzilla\u201d combined.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place extensively in the Quantum Realm, which provides an unsightly setting of muted, dark brown, washed-out visuals. It\u2019s an ugly place, so who why would audiences want to spend time there? The Realm is a melting pot of exotic creatures and peculiar inhabitants that appear to have waltzed right out of the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine. They\u2019re cool to look at I guess, but was the point to make the film more appealing to children, or was it Disney\u2019s way of appeasing the animators by letting them have some fun?\r\n\r\nThe first third of the film seems like it\u2019s Janet\u2019s show, as she keeps bringing up the fact that she has all these secrets that she won\u2019t spill to Hope and Hank (even though they\u2019re all stuck in the Realm together). There\u2019s no compelling mystery nor reveal. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness is grasping at straws to craft a somewhat cohesive story while also struggling to make it fit into the MCU mythology. At some point, I wish someone would just make a damn standalone Marvel superhero movie and quit worrying about who and what goes where and how.\r\n\r\nThe story is frequently erratic. There\u2019s plenty of energetic CGI action, but there also some moments that play like a touching family drama, some that create an anti-climatic post-apocalyptic narrative, and lots of failed attempts at comic relief. The film also has recurring (and awkward) socially conscious messaging that doesn\u2019t entirely feel out of place, but it is aggressive (there\u2019s even a direct mention of socialism by one of the characters, which will really aggravate already-angry conservatives).\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is peppered with dreadful one-liners like \u201cit\u2019s never too late to stop being a dick!\u201d and \u201cants don\u2019t give up!\u201d I really, really wish I was joking about this.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the movie features a lot of talk about time, the desire to get home, and \u2014 Marvel fans, you know what\u2019s coming \u2014 the multiverse! It\u2019s that one little word that means endless movies, endless stories, and endless money. It\u2019s also the easy way to guarantee that all of these films in the canon always have a cop-out to lazily excuse away any inconsistencies (not that many of us could keep up or remember anyway).\r\n\r\nAnother major problem with the film is that it can only chug along on Rudd\u2019s likeability (and the cast\u2019s talent) for so long. It\u2019s barely tolerable until Kang shows up, but he\u2019s a wickedly delicious character portrayed by a terrific actor (it\u2019s a real shame that this had to be the film for Majors\u2019 MCU debut). In fact, the entire cast deserves better. Despite all of them turning in strong performances, they still feel mostly wasted here.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\u201d lacks the memorable spectacle that most superhero films need in order to succeed. There\u2019s no massively rousing, crowd-pleasing moment, and it\u2019s one of the more unremarkable entries in the MCU.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS**", "Honestly this is easily my favorite out of the series. Still funny as normal but there's a lot more action and cool looking stuff in this movie. Really good movie.", "This one was quite good actually. Marvel is quite a bit of hit and miss lately. It all depends on whether one of the woke retards has gotten their grubby hands on the script or not.\r\n\r\nIt was of course encouraging that the woke \u201ccritics\u201d on the well known rubbish site Rotten Tomatoes declared it rotten while it got a 82% score from the actual audience. Always a good sign for a movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a pure adventure movie meant to entertain the audience. The script is decent and, as usual with a Marvel movie, serves mainly to create a reason for doing action sequences and lots and lots of special effects.\r\n\r\nThe adventure is mixed in with some humor but it is generally okay and not overdone.\r\n\r\nThe scenery in the quantum world is fantastic and the creatures are great ranging from terrifying to quite fun. Bringing in Bill Murray was a nice surprise even though he was a bit of a bad guy and quite short lived.\r\n\r\nThe one character I really didn\u2019t like was Paul Rudd as the Ant-Man. His anti-hero bullshit, reluctance to fight and generally being a douche until he was forced to actually do what was right was really grating on me.\r\n\r\nOverall though this was some well spent two hours.", "While Creed III may not be the best in the franchise, it brings enough creativity and passion to the table to keep the series fresh.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky/Creed franchise is at its best when the villain is just as, if not more, interesting than our protagonist, and that is not more evident than in Creed III. Damien Anderson (expertly played by Jonathan Majors) is a very sympathetic antagonist that has a direct connection with Adonis Creed\u2019s past. This connection is at the forefront of the conflict as Creed tries to reconcile with his past mistakes while also being true to his present self. This back and forth is excellently done and evolves Creed further as a boxer and a man. I really enjoyed this story overall, and while it may not be the most unique script to hit the silver screen, it does enough to differentiate itself from the rest of the Rocky universe, and I can respect that.\r\n\r\nThe acting in this film is excellent, as it has been in previous Creed films. I thought that there might be a hole left by the absence of Sylvester Stallone, but I really did not notice it at all. Michael B. Jordan is able to get the best out of the entire cast, and everyone is better than ever. Tessa Thompson is fantastic; her chemistry with Jordan is incredible. The addition of their daughter creates a very wholesome family dynamic. Jonathan Majors is superb; he is intimidating, tragic, and full of emotion that the audience can genuinely resonate with. His anger is justified, and his portrayal of this angry kid who had his life taken from him is incredibly genuine. He was one of the best parts of the film.\r\n\r\nWith Michael B. Jordan behind the camera, this film has the most unique cinematography in the entire series. Jordan takes some liberties with the material that came before to deliver a modern spin on the boxing genre. Where previous films tried to have a broadcast experience grounded in grit and realism, Creed III turns that on its head, delivering the most stunning action scenes I have ever seen. The anime inspiration is apparent, with slow motion used sparingly but effectively. The finale fight has some very creative choices that create an intimate connection between our two leads that is a great backdrop to not only the fight but the story as a whole.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had an excellent time watching Creed III. Michael B. Jordan had a wonderful directorial debut, creating a film that left me with a huge smile on my face.\r\n\r\nScore: 92% |\r\nVerdict: Excellent", "If not for a trademark over-the-top Nicolas Cage performance and a truly inspired fight scene in an apartment complex, \u201cRenfield\u201d would be a total disaster of a movie. It\u2019s certainly not any good and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone, and the real horror of it all is the way director Chris McKay blows what should have been a slam-dunk premise.\r\n\r\nSet in present day, Renfield (Nicholas Hoult) is the tortured, loyal assistant to Dracula (Cage). He\u2019s served his master for decades, taking care of everything from getting his cape dry cleaned to procuring fresh prey for dinner. After centuries of servitude, Renfield is finally ready to move on and create a life of his own.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is mostly dead in the water, the film\u2019s pacing never feels slow. There\u2019s plenty of entertainment, it\u2019s just not fun enough, outrageous enough, nor twisted enough. The tone is both tongue-in-cheek and sincere, which is not cohesive as a whole. There\u2019s a lot of action that means nothing, and characters like Awkwafina\u2018s police officer that are bland and forgettable.\r\n\r\nThe side plots about a crime family with a ruthless boss (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and her son (Ben Schwartz) that wants Renfield dead is half-baked, and the funny group therapy bits where Dracula\u2019s assistant seeks help for co-dependency and dealing with his raging narcissist of a boss falls flat. The ideas all sound so good on paper, but are poorly executed across the board. That\u2019s why the movie feels so underwhelming.\r\n\r\nCage is by far the best part of this mess, and he is an actor who is born to play Dracula. He hams it up in every scene, and his unhinged take is genuinely scary but also goofy. His manic line delivery and unhinged inflection of such dialogue gems like \u201cHail Satan\u201d is absolute bliss.\r\n\r\nThe blood and gore is over-the-top and mostly used in a humorous manner, but this isn\u2019t for the squeamish. There is graphic throat ripping, spurting blood, and abdomens slit open with internal organs visibly spilling out. McKay doesn\u2019t shy away from the violence (and the makeup and effects are really great), which should at least delight horror fans.\r\n\r\nWith such a great idea for story, it\u2019s a bummer that \u201cRenfield\u201d is disappointing in nearly every way imaginable. You\u2019ll find yourself mourning what it could have been.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "I was not expecting much from Renfield and it pretty much gave me exactly what I was expecting: a mediocre film that was nothing offensive but all too forgettable.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is really all over the place. There are too many subplots and not enough time spent on the actual draw to the film, Dracula. Awkwafina's subplot was half baked and really did not go anywhere. I felt as though her character could have entirely been written out of the film to spend more time on Renfield and Dracula. The comedy is pretty bad. I do not remember laughing one time during the hour-thirty-minute runtime. There were clear jokes that they were trying to set up, but they just did not land for me.\r\n\r\nPerformances were fine. Nicholas Cage was great as Dracula, but unfortunately did not have enough screen time or material to really make a huge impact on the film. Nicholas Holt was good in his role, but again I do not think he had much to work with. Everyone else gave really average performances. Awkwafina plays literally the same style of character as she did in Shang Chi, and it was fine, but nothing that really blew me away.\r\n\r\nThe direction was pretty poor. So many action scenes had a tremendous amount of shaky cam and some weird motion blur type effect that made it really hard to see what was happening. It was brutal, don't get me wrong, and I loved what they attempted to go for, but it really just landed flat. Coming off from John Wick just a few weeks ago, the action direction was apparently bad. The gore was at an extreme, but for the love of God, why did they choose to use CGI blood? The graphics literally looked like something out of a PS2 Mortal Kombat; absolutely terrible. Which is a shame because that mixed with the poor action direction really took me out of every scene when I should have been locked in having a bloody good time.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film is a misstep in what could have been a fun, campy, cult classic. The jumbled screenplay, poor stunt choreography, and terrible effects really hold this movie back from its true potential. There is nothing truly awful that make this a bad movie, just enough there to make it an extremely average experience.\r\n\r\nScore: 44% \u274c\r\nVerdict: Poor", "Raw and ruthless - The Killer by David Fincher is basically a 75% thriller 25% action movie that tells about the daily life of a hired hitman - that makes a mistake on job (this is shown in the first 30 min). Then he and who he cares (a girlfriend in Dominican Republic) will pay the price - but things aren't so easy. It reminded me very much the ecstasy of seeing the fist movie incarnation of 007 by Daniel Craig raw violence and not a snobby agent on a suit. \r\n\r\nHe won't let those whom did he things go impune, so what to do do? Chase one by one, hitman style, silent, evasive, focalized - the prototype of a Sigma male (like others characters aka John Wick, James Bond, etc.).\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher is already know by a huge list of excellent movies including The SOcial Network, Se7ven, Gone Girl, Fight Club, The Zodiac, Mindhunter and the list go on. He already have his established style, violent and gritty and The Killer doesn't go far from it. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong - this isn't from the \"another movie\" perspective, by another good movie perspective. Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en, 8mm) wrote the script based on the french comic book 'Le Tueurby\" by the writer Matz and artist Luc Jacamon (2000).\r\n\r\nAction wise, the movie have more scenes of the standard procedures of the \"profession\" that raw action, aside from one chapter, where there is a brutal fight (the movie is divided in chapters btw). Michael Fassbender and the others (I am truly a fan of any movie that Tilda Swinton stars) - are the pieces that make the movie especially the first one, raw, obstinate and methodic while always listening to \"The Smiths\" to keep his mind clean and focus on what to do, to not deviate from the plan. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are few lines of dialog between characters, 90% os the dialog is from Fassbender in first person, on the thoughts in his mind. \r\n\r\nAside from the strange fitting of Morrissey in the music track, we have a minimalistic but sober OST made impeccability by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. This movie is a must watch to anyone that enjoy hitman's movies - I gave it a 8,0 out of 10,0 score / A-. \r\n\r\nWe may have a contender from adapted screenplay here for the Academy, and maybe for best actor and direction.", "Perhaps the greatest thing this remarkable film brings to the table is value of love and life, over war and death.\r\n\r\nI am surprised this film was made, in so much, as it shows exactly what the US military industrial complex, stands for. That is callous cruelty, violence, intolerance and death. \r\n\r\nIn a sense then this film could be said to be set in any of the battlefields, in any Asian country, the US has invaded. The fact it has a futuristic overlay, does not detract from powerful and often moving, anti-war, pro peace message, it compellingly conveys. It could not be more timely either, given the US's attempts, to light wars across the world.\r\n\r\nI rarely call a film \"inspired\" in its honesty and its humanity, but The Creator meets that definition, in every sense.

Adam Driver is a great actor but this movie is so incredible boring. 90% of the movie are encounters to another and then another and then another dangerous blood seeking Dino. Just when you think the story might get anywhere there is another Dino to shoot.  Slowly you are realizing there is no more extra story. it is just a short journey to a top of a hill fighting Dino's. And Adam is a father of a 9 year old but then on this journey he has to do the journey with another 9 year old (which looks too old) and suddenly  becomes like the dumbest not able to communicate person in the world.  Such a waist of actor talent and special effects money. My guess is that the makers have cgi or vision art backgrounds because the only thing well done in this movie are the special effects.", "The best way I can describe this effort is a contemporised, misinterpretation, of Dumas novel. \r\n\r\nIf, like me, you have read The Three Musketeers novel, more than once, you'll find this film largely divorced, from that work. The inconsistencies are glaring. \r\n\r\nThe most obvious is steering this tale away from its focus on the male leads, in favour of not necessarily peripheral but definitely secondary or tertiary, female characters. Yes, in my opinion, its yet another clumsy chance to hoist the flag of feminism. Making female characters relevant to the story, in the modern woke context. Of course, this predictably, unbalances the story. The musketeers, are, nudged into the background, in the own tale. \r\n\r\nThe second point of failure is the age of D'Artagnan, who in past films is typically played by a young male actor because this tale, in a sense, is a coming of age story. That's all swept aside too, quite possibly in service to the feminisation of the story.Instead, he's portrayed by a 33 year old man, incongruously called, \"a boy\". Suffice to say, it all feels rather awkward.\r\n\r\nAre there any redeeming elements to the production? Obviously, the acting is sound, its a strong cast. Money has been spent on sets, settings, fight choreography and more, to try to bring this period in French history, to life.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, so much else is wrong that this film simply feels \"openly fake\", to this reviewer. I do not see it as a loyal expression, of Dumas sterling work. Nor the period, in which it is set.\r\n\r\nIn summary,feminises an essentially masculine tale. Don't believe me, just look at the poster, not to mention the film itself. In my view  there are numerous superior and more accurate, cinematic expressions of Dumas work, on offer.", "Well, they made The Exorcist woke... and oddly Anti-Catholic... and it flopped.\r\n\r\nSeriously, The Pope's Exorcist was better and EVERYONE knew that was going to flop.  I'm going to tell you right now that you should go back and watch the prequel movies because they were better... BOTH of them.\r\n\r\nYou have two little girls, a strong anti-Catholic message, a strong anti-patriarchy message, you know... the usual Hollywood meh messaging (except the Anti-Catholic part, that is a dead horse that hasn't been beaten nearly as much) and, most importantly, the same sequel/reboot/franchise killer that seems to go out of it's way to insult all the fans of the original film...\r\n\r\n... and everyone that helped make it.  Which, honestly, is also a dead horse that's been beaten too much these days.  In fact, insulting the original is sort of a trope these days.\r\n\r\nPeople that actually like Terminator: Dark Fate are going to rave about this one... but everyone else is going to roll their eyes because at the end of the day, it has the exact same boring message as everything else.\r\n\r\nAnd like everything else with that message, everything else from bookend to bookend takes a backseat to it.  Bad dialogue peppered with political lectures.  Bad acting (but let's be honest, they had nothing to work with) and in the end even the demon lacked the sardonic and vulgar wit of the first one.\r\n\r\nBut, hey, if you liked Dark Fate and thought The Rise of Skywalker was better than Empire, this movie is for you.\r\n\r\nBut everyone else has seen it before and is tired of it.", "\"Angela\" (Lidya Jewett) and her school mate \"Katherine\" (Olivia O'Neill) go for a walk in the woods one day.

It's ten minutes shy of two hours long this, and that's about ninety minutes too long. The vast majority of this film is taken up by pointless preamble, family establishment scenarios and unfortunately the acting and writing are really lacklustre too. Burstyn only makes sparing appearances and Odom Jr. ought to just stick to singing. The last ten minutes is slightly better than standard Blumhouse fayre that concludes this completely unnecessary sequel with, admittedly, a couple of not so predicable twists, but still - with very little to make the preceding drudge worth watching. This is a poor relation to the original and should have gone straight to a streamer.", "As the son of parents who were childhood sweethearts/soul mates, I tend to be a sucker for movie romances that address this subject. In this case, however, the only \u201csucker\u201d aspect applies to the money I plunked down to watch this two-hour snoozefest. Writer-director Celine Song\u2019s debut feature has been praised as a masterful piece of filmmaking and one of the best pictures of 2023, but I heartily beg to disagree. When a pair of young, tightly knit Korean friends, Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), part ways from their native Seoul and are later reunited in New York after a 24-year separation, the reunion of these childhood pals provides them with an opportunity to reflect on what might have been. However, their time together consists mostly of a series of overly bloated pregnant pauses, inane dialogue and missed chances to discuss much of anything meaningful, the kinds of scenes that make even the most patient viewers want to yell \u201cGet on with it already!\u201d These \u201cconversations\u201d come nowhere close to matching their joy of their spirited youthful interactions or the heartfelt, substantive talks that later take place between Nora and her husband, Arthur (John Magaro). The result is, quite frankly, a big fat bore that\u2019s trying to be more than it is but never achieves that outcome. Perhaps the biggest problem with this is the film\u2019s truly sincere but decidedly paper thin narrative that doesn\u2019t have the writing support to bring it all into beautiful full bloom, despite some fine performances, exquisite cinematography and an emotive background score. From this, the director would appear to have a hefty reserve of potential stashed away, at least based on this offering\u2019s stylistic elements, but the substance could use some definite shoring up. Let\u2019s hope her next effort lives up to that.", "Wow. For a director, Celine Song, just coming out of the gate, this is quite an impressive film. The lead actress, Greta Lee, fit the role like a soft leather glove, which speaks volumes, both for her talent, and for Song's casting. Lee's Hollywood Critics Association Best Actress award is well-deserved.\r\n\r\nSong wrote an excellent screenplay, and her direction turned it into a stunning film. Kudos to A24 for taking a chance on her. I presume they are happy with the outcome. It's rather interestingly paced in a Buddhist or Asian kind of way - slow, meditative, and more is shown than is said. Overall, it's not a perfect film, but it's close.\r\n\r\nThis isn't precisely a coming-of-age movie, but the plot revolves around that (perhaps even more difficult,) developing period between the ages of 20 and mid-30s. I've held a long-standing belief that our life chapters change every seven years. You know: there are seven chakras, seven days in a week, the Seven Sisters (Pleiades), or whichever mystical seven you'd like. Over the course of three of these \"theoretical\" chapters, this movie focuses on two relationships in the protagonist's life, from roughly twenty-one (7*3) to approximately forty-two (7*6). She was married at about the time of a chapter shift (7*5), as if to validate my weird belief. In my world, it all makes sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie is certainly somewhat autobiographical, even by Song's own admission. It will be added to my Directors About Themselves list. I can't wait to see Celine's next project!", "If you are expecting an Evil Dead movie... well, I guess it depends on what generation you're from.  If you are expecting Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness, the films of the unholy trilogy... you are going to be gravely disappointed.  This isn't Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.\r\n\r\nThis is, well, this is the Conjuring just like almost every other Horror movie past 2014.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really breathe \"new life\" into the franchise, instead it takes the Evil Dead and breathes the PG-13 Neo-Horror Movie breathe into a franchise that used to be a heck of a lot of campy immature fun.  \r\n\r\nHere you get the same as everything else.", "Evil Dead Rise puts a creative spin on the classic franchise while also remaining faithful to the core experience.\r\n\r\nThe story is not overly complex and admittedly somewhat generic, as the main characters find the Book of the Dead, read it, and all hell breaks loose. But the conditions surrounding this plot are what truly set it apart. For one, the high-rise setting was brilliant and created a very claustrophobic environment that worked really well. I found the earthquake to be an original idea not only for the discovery of The Necronomicon but also for the entrapment of our main characters.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of our cast, this film does a really great job of setting up these characters. I genuinely liked all of them, which made it difficult to see some of them go, unlike in Evil Dead (2013). The familiar bond between them was palpable, and this could not have been done without a fantastic cast. Alyssa Sutherland is by far my favorite Deadite in the entire franchise. Her motherly connection was haunting, her facial expressions, and mannerisms are nightmare fuel. Lily Sullivan was genuinely fantastic as a final girl. Her badass nature to defend the children is incredible, and she had some really great moments to stand out in the film. The kids overall did fine, nothing that was too amazing but nothing that took away from the film either.\r\n\r\nThe direction was my favorite part of the film by far. Lee Cronin did such a fantastic job with haunting camera work with subtle tilts and use of reflections. The action was top-notch, and the practical effects were amazing. So many scenes had me physically wincing with some insanely creative violence mixed with stomach-churning blood and wound effects. It is definitely a worthy successor to Evil Dead (2013) in the gore department.\r\n\r\nOverall, this may not be the best in the franchise, but I think it is one of the most refined. The story lacks in some areas, but the direction, performances, and violence really cement this as one of the best horror films of the year.\r\n\r\nScore: 84%  \u2705\r\nVerdict: Great", "As contemporary horror films go, I\u2019ll freely admit that this is a genre about which I couldn\u2019t care less. I find most of these films boring, predictable, stupid and not especially scary. In fact, the only ones to which I\u2019ll even give a second look are smart horror films (like \u201cGet Out\u201d (2017) or \u201cAnnihilation\u201d (2018)) or campy romps (like \u201cRenfield\u201d (2023)). So the fact that I somehow managed to sit through this trash heap is quite an accomplishment. (Actually, the only reason I watched was because I was channel surfing and there was nothing else on, so I decided to give it a chance (I would have been better turning on the radio).) This pointless parade of endless blood and gore is a prime example of the decline of the mainstream movie industry (how projects like this get greenlighted is beyond me, except, of course, for the obvious box office considerations). It\u2019s so utterly ridiculous that the picture plays like something that was made up as the crew went along. I\u2019ll admit that there was some modestly cheeky humor here, but not enough to make it a genuine camp fest. Writer-director Lee Cronin\u2019s latest is an assault on the art of filmmaking, the kind that should carry fines and other punishments.

Unfortunately, it isn't able to escape the narrative formulas of \"humans possessed by demons\" repeated over several decades in this \"subgenre\" of exorcisms. Russell Crowe elevates the movie quite a bit with a well-rounded performance, seamlessly blending the dramatic moments with his character's comedic personality. However, the constant tonal changes create uncertainty about the type of film we're supposed to be watching. Personally, it's a mixed bag...\"\r\n\r\nRating: C+", "An episode of supernatural would've done a better job. Movie was mid at best", "Beau is Afraid certainly boasts an incredibly rich and intricate narrative, filled with a plethora of allegories, symbolisms, and thematic elements. However, one may question whether the complexity of the film is worth sacrificing entertainment value. In attempting to weave together these complex themes, Ari Aster has created a narrative that was very difficult for me to fully process.\r\n\r\nDuring the first hour of the movie, I found myself engrossed in the story, with tense scenes that blurred the lines between what is real and what is fake. However, as the film progressed, these surreal scenes became increasingly wild and disjointed, leaving me feeling disconnected from the narrative. I found myself constantly asking questions about what was happening, how we got there, and why things were unfolding the way they were. This detachment ultimately detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film.\r\n\r\nAt three hours in length, Beau is Afraid can be a daunting task for audiences to undertake. While a well-paced film can fly by (Avatar: The Way of Water and Babylon for instance), this one felt like a slog at times, and I found myself frequently checking the clock to see how much time was left. However, despite these shortcomings, the technical execution of the film was truly exceptional. Aster's direction was brilliant, with stunning camera work and beautiful cinematography. The acting was also top-notch, with Joaquin Phoenix delivering what was arguably the best performance of the year so far. The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan, Patti LuPone, and Nathan Lane, also gave standout performances.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Beau is Afraid was quite a letdown for me. While Aster undoubtedly has a brilliant mind and a talent for storytelling, this film may have suffered from a lack of restraint. Nonetheless, the technical prowess and stellar performances are certainly noteworthy and should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nScore: 41% \u274c\r\nVerdict: Poor", "Zero spoilers in here. \r\n\r\nAbsolutely wonderful. I can't do a big braining on what everything means in this crazy topsy-turvy roller-coaster of a movie, but it's one hell of an entertaining ride if you just sit back and enjoy it. For me, this movie needed to be watched the same way I watched Lost Highway - don't try to understand it, just be open to being frightened and entertained. \r\n\r\nSuffering from generalized anxiety myself, the first part of the movie is absolutely brilliant, showing the world through the lens of someone with a severe case of anxiety. Everything is over the top, and the attention to detail is stunning.\r\n\r\nThe movie devolves further and further into madness, somewhat akin to the way it did in Mother, except not in a frustrating way, but rather an action-packed and crazy, sometimes touching way. Oh, and hilarious. There are such funny moments in this movie, often absurdly so.\r\n\r\nI didn't read up on anything before watching this movie, and I had no idea it was going to be three hours. I didn't know Ari Aster made it, and frankly I didn't know who he was. Looking it up afterwards, I see he made Midsommar, which I found tedious and boring, and Hereditary, which I absolutely loved.\r\n\r\nI can definitely see how someone could hate this movie. I can also sympathize with being frustrated with it if trying to understand everything. I think the best way to watch this is popcorn. Watch this like you'd watch a popcorn flick, except expect absurdities instead of explosions (though we do get explosions here, too). That's how you'll be entertained by this amazing movie. I'll be watching this again.\r\n\r\nOh, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. Absolutely his most impressive performance so far.\r\n\r\nWatch this. It's special. Even if you hate it, you won't regret watching it.", "Not for everyone indeed. But it is A24 and Ari Aster (and yeah I am a fan of his works). It is very difficult to categorize the movie... part thriller, part abstract, part (well mostly) dark comedy. \r\n\r\nWho knows Ari Aster works of before (Hereditary, Midsommar) knows he likes a lot to put abstract, symbolic and allegorical scenes, and pieces of the plot hidden thorough the movie. Beau Wasserman is unique and pitiless. \r\n\r\nThis one is surely one he put a hell of an effort to put things, and make sense in the senseless... and in chaos that is a definition for what I saw, it is pretty crazy as some flicks from the 70's (see Holy Mountain of 73, or Zardoz of 74 and you will get the LSD level of the scenes). Some more recent movies had that WTF moments too, like the middle part of Triangle of Sadness or some parts of White Noise (both of 2022) and you get the level of non-sense and comic all together.\r\n\r\nThe best definition of the Kafkaesqueness of Beau is to pick some work of the dutch painting Hieronymus Bosch of the XV century and try to grab some meaning on it. It is there but not so obvious.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Beau you can see two things: 1-) he is clearly someone with deeply psychological or psychiatric issues and 2-) he has a deep anxiety and FEAR all along the movie in the hope to not let people down or not to be a disappointment to anybody even he is clearly being it already in his mind. It is on the title of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe most \"normal\" scenes in the movie are the ones in the start of the movie in the psychiatrist bed (the ones that he must have with lot's of water - I don't know if it is a joke or not but Wass in german means \"water\" and element that is present since the beginning of the movie). \r\n\r\nIt must be interesting to see Aster working in his works, because neither one is simple, all are complex and relates to parts that we seen before. His passion for his work makes him one of the directors I admire at the most. Some people don't like him - the same way some people don't like Lars von Trier works. It is a matter of taste, and it is totally normal.\r\n\r\nFor me the story told is all above - don't try to pick what is real and what isn't, because out of the clinic door all is in Beau's head. Fragments of reality and inner issues in a bizarre blender that isn't for everyone.\r\n\r\nI wish I had seen it on the theater there were some scenes that made me laugh a lot and at the same time felt guilty like the one at his attic. \r\n\r\nOn the technical side: Joaquin Phoenix again is a powerhouse in acting (and Academy worthy maybe?), the script is pretty original (well, last year Everything Everywhere All at Once was mostly non-sense but with a sense and won tons of stuff) and the work on editing and art direction are excellent and again long colaborator Pawel Pogorzelski work as cinematography is impeccable.\r\n\r\nI liked the movie, it isn't the best of Ari Aster (and three hours are heavy on most of the cases), but is pretty good: my score is 8,3 out of 10,0 / A -.", "The Wandering Earth II or the \"wandering script\", as I call it, does nothing to improve upon a proposition that failed to work, the first time around.\r\n\r\nIts alright to create a space saga but trying to cram the whole thing down the audiences throat in two sittings, is simply too much to ask. My wife, who is Chinese, became exasperated about half an hour in and I don't blame her. \r\n\r\nThere are simply too many disparate things going on at once, for this film  to present anything, even a highly switched on viewer, like my economist other half, can reasonably follow. \r\n\r\nWhat you are left with, is what amounts to mini films, that feel like little like extended trailers, cobbled together over an lengthy time line, that become so diffuse, as to loose the potential to represent any semblance of a comprehensible \"whole\". \r\n\r\nGraphics are admittedly amazing, as are some of the sci fi conceptualisations. Acting's mostly pretty decent, too. That said, what are these elements without clarity of storytelling?\r\n\r\nIn summary, best described as an overly ambitious, ill considered \"sci fi, hot mess\" that's clearly had a lot of time and money invested in it. If this had been broken down into smaller, bite sized films with less crammed in, I think it could have worked, a lot better.", "It may still be early in the year, but \u201cMafia Mamma\u201d is a definite contender for worst film of 2023. This vapid comedy (from director Catherine Hardwicke) feels like it was crafted by a soccer mom groupthink, with a ridiculous fantasy story that\u2019s struggling to be hip and edgy. It\u2019s a truly terrible movie that\u2019s a complete waste of time for everyone but those who have the absolute lowest of low standards when it comes to their choice of entertainment.\r\n\r\nLike most women, American mom Kristin (Toni Collette) has a lot on her plate. She keeps her home running despite dealing with the double emotional punch of her son going off to college as well as discovering that her cheating husband is having an affair. Things aren\u2019t going so well when she gets a mysterious phone call with a shocking message: she has inherited her grandfather\u2019s mafia empire in Italy. Guided by the firm\u2019s consigliere (Monica Bellucci), Kristin must gain the self-confidence to become the new leader of the (mafia) family business.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the fish-out-of-water premise is a good one. The story outline is fine, but the execution is a debacle. Although they are working within a very broad parameter of mass appeal, the screenwriting trio\u2019s (Amanda Sthers, J. Michael Feldman, and Debbie Jhoon) script feels like a struggle to stay above water. The writing talks down to the audience and narrative includes dumb scenarios that feel like a sad sack\u2019s fantasy (the worst being a hunky local guy (Giulio Corso) who is instantly smitten by Kristin the second she lands in Rome, and the eventual \u201ctwist\u201d that anyone with half a brain can see coming from a mile away). It\u2019s also filled with tired Italian stereotypes and has such a strong desire to be a \u201ccool and different kind of comedy\u201d that it earns an R rating with bloody violence and a bunch of cursing.\r\n\r\nEven worse is Collette\u2019s performance, which is an overblown exercise in desperation and overacting. Her take on the timeworn goofy, gullible American shtick feels like a huge stretch, to the point where her character becomes a weak caricature of a real woman. Kristin is a complete clown, even in a film that is trying (but not exactly succeeding) to tell a story of female empowerment. It\u2019s a tragic waste of Collette\u2019s talent. She is so much better than this.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t think of anything positive to say about \u201cMafia Mamma.\u201d Even your worst enemy deserves better.\r\n**\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREENZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "A completely stupid comedy.\r\nIt could have been an excellent film for having almost all the conditions for it.

There are seven to eight characters introduced throughout the course of the film, with each given significant time to develop their story and motivations. This takes a lot of time away from the main attraction, the cocaine bear. There is a period of almost 45 minutes where we are focused on these \"secondary\" characters, without any action or appearance of the cocaine bear. This section was pretty slow paced and started to lose me, but once the bear is re-introduced, the film gets significantly better. The paramedic scene was superb.\r\n\r\nThe comedy was pretty lackluster as well. The entire theater was laughing aloud, but I found myself only chuckling at a few jokes. This left the script feeling somewhat bland. But the lack of humor is made up for by the absolute brutality on display. There are some really messed up kills that do not shy away from the blood and gore. Some of the effects looked to be prosthetics as well, which always have an especially disgusting appearance to them.\r\n\r\nThe story overall was pretty decent, but the ending was atrocious and incredibly predictable. I found that it was really over the top and cheesy, but not in a good way. \r\n\r\nThe visual appearance of the bear was pretty solid. The CGI was done well but is spotty in a couple of scenes.

I loved it as a one time watch. Not so much the 2nd time though. If you are one of those who like to go critical on not-so-logical jokes, then give this a miss.

I understand with a premise like that, it\u2019s supposed to be stupid. The problem is that the movie isn\u2019t just dumb, it\u2019s actually bad, with poor direction, acting, CGI, writing, and storytelling.\r\n\r\nLoosely based on true events (yes, really), the film is inspired by the 1985 story of a drug runner\u2019s plane crash. In order to save a large quantity of cocaine, the man threw out several duffel bags full of the stuff over Tennessee and then jumped to his death when his parachute didn\u2019t open. A black bear got into the drugs, consumed most of it and, according to experts, immediately died. This movie imagines what could have happened if the bear didn\u2019t die from ingesting all that booger sugar. In this bloody and gory version, the 500 pound apex predator goes bananas and kills everyone in sight.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fictional story that is stretched too thin, especially with the meager subplots about a single mom (Keri Russell), her missing daughter (Brooklynn Prince) and friend (Christian Convery), a group of criminals (Ray Liotta, O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich), two park rangers (Margo Martindale, Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a police detective (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), and random tourists and teenagers that must think on their toes in order to avoid being the bear\u2019s next victim. Jimmy Warden\u2018s script is atrocious because he\u2019s trying to force a story that\u2019s not at all compelling nor complex. The actors give clunky performances and character-wise, there just isn\u2019t a whole lot to root for.\r\n\r\nBanks isn\u2019t the most skilled director, and a film like this certainly doesn\u2019t demand a whole lot of talent behind the camera. But there\u2019s something that consistently feels \u201coff\u201d with her style and tone, especially in the random, mostly unsuccessful jokes. The humor didn\u2019t work for me at all, and when I did muster a laugh, I wasn\u2019t doing so because the movie was good \u2014 I was laughing because the movie was so dumb. I understand that a movie about a huge bear ingesting a bounty of blow is supposed to be dumb, but it also has to be good in order to work, and this movie is not.\r\n\r\nTo become a cult classic, a movie must be one that you\u2019d want to watch on repeat. \u201cCocaine Bear\u201d is simply not funny enough, not campy enough, and not kooky enough to succeed. It\u2019s nothing but a one-joke trainwreck. \r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**", "**_Not funny enough as a comedy and too silly to take serious_**\r\n \r\nIn 1985, several bags of cocaine fall from a drug smuggling plane in the mountainous area of northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee. Near Blood Mountain, a mother black bear eats a lot of the cocaine and goes on a bloody spree as it menaces hikers, rangers, thugs, EMTs and cops.\r\n\r\n\u201cCocaine Bear\u201d (2023) is a campy creature feature inspired by the true story directed by, of all people, Elizabeth Banks. It was Ray Liotta\u2019s second to last movie before his death on May 26, 2022. Keri Russell is on hand as the concerned mother of a tween hiker. In real-life the black bear weighed 175 lbs, but this was changed to almost 400 lbs for the movie.\r\n\r\nThe production unbelievably cost $35 million. I say \u201cunbelievably\u201d because this is a decidedly throwaway creature feature of the semi-goofy SyFy variety. The CGI is a little superior, but not enough to make any appreciable difference. I\u2019m speaking as someone who enjoys some of the better SyFy flicks on occasion. A good example is \u201cSasquatch Mountain\u201d (2006), aka \u201cDevil on the Mountain,\u201d which only cost $800,000.\r\n\r\nExcept for the lush scenery (shot in Ireland, locations listed below), this is decent but generally meh. It\u2019s not humorous enough as a comedy, but you can\u2019t take it serious either because it\u2019s too goofy. It doesn\u2019t help that Keri is the only female worth mentioning (as a footnote at that).\r\n\r\nHow this garnered as much attention as it did is a great mystery. \u201cGrizzly Park\u201d (2008) treaded similar terrain and, while far from a great movie, is more entertaining than this (at a fraction of the budget). \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot south of Dublin, Ireland, in Barnaslingan, Powerscourt and, further south, Avoca.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-", "I got excited for this one, I mean it's 2023 and Cocaine Bear had the promise of NOT being political.

The humor was clearly there on paper.  That was evident enough, but the delivery was... meh.  The jokes didn't land because they ran too long, the timing was off, everything was there for it to be funny and fun... it just feels like it was made by a director that can't tell a joke.\r\n\r\nAnd it falls on the director, because the writer clearly can.  Everything is there to make it work.  But all the action is predictable and all the jokes are butchered.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of anyone else, this would have been hysterical fun.", "Writer-director Wes Anderson has lost his way, and this film proves it. I realize that the auteur\u2019s signature style of filmmaking is an acquired taste, and, to his credit, he\u2019s made some fine pictures over the years. But this one is not among them. In fact, contrary to many of the inexplicable claims that this is his finest release, I\u2019d contend just the opposite. It\u2019s arguably his worst, a meandering, cryptic, unfocused piece that\u2019s so muddled you\u2019ll need the assistance of a search party to find your way out of it (that is, if you even care by the time the end of this overlong mess rolls around). The director appears to have become so enamored with his own eccentricity that it doesn\u2019t even seem to matter to him whether or not viewers are on the same page as he is. Admittedly, this offering once again captures Anderson\u2019s singularly stylish look with a stunning production design and gorgeous cinematography. But that\u2019s all it has going for it, and that\u2019s unfortunate given the phenomenal cast he has available to him. What\u2019s more, despite his proficiency in creating superb visual style, he\u2019s forgotten about pairing it with meaningful (or even interesting) substance. Its incomprehensibility and inclusion of bits that are there just for the sake of their own whimsy seriously undercut any effort to make this an intelligible work. In short, \u201cAsteroid City\u201d is yet another major disappointment in what is turning out to be a dreadfully dismal summer movie season. It\u2019s likely to appeal only to diehard fans of the director (and maybe not even a lot of them this time out). If you\u2019re on the fence about this one, consider the following two telling tipoffs: (1) when no one in the theater is laughing at what\u2019s been billed as a comedy, that should speak volumes about it (as happened at the screening I attended); and (2) when you consider how aggressively and ubiquitously the distributors have been promoting this film in ads on TV and the internet, it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re trying awfully hard to peddle shabby, substandard merchandise. This is a huge waste of time and money; don\u2019t squander yours.", "Even though the film has a fair share of chuckle worthy moments, _Asteroid City_ shamelessly rolls around in its eccentricities and unapologetic blundering demeanor with no real depth or character development whatsoever. The gathering of extraordinary talent draws you in yet _Asteroid City_ doesn\u2019t deliver a story that\u2019s fully worth telling.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/24/asteroid-city-review-wes-andersons-charmless-comedic-drama/", "Most critics have their personal favorite directors, and it\u2019s sometimes a challenge to keep strict objectivity when reviewing one of their projects. That\u2019s why it pains me to write about \u201cAsteroid City,\u201d the sluggish, smug, exasperating new film from co-writer and director Wes Anderson. In what is unquestionably his worst film by a mile, Anderson leans too heavily on his ordered, signature visual symmetry, saturated color palate, and A-list cast while completely forgetting how to make an entertaining movie.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place in a tiny desert town (famous for their giant crater) where the Junior Stargazers and Space Cadets are holding their awards convention. The event brings together students and their parents, all oddballs in their own right, from all over the country. When a UFO is spotted, the visitors are quarantined until the government deems it safe for them to return to the real world.\r\n\r\nThe plot is thin yet confusing, as the film simultaneously depicts the events of the convention in the form of a stage play, the creation of the play, and the actual events in a retro version of 1955. With so much going on, you\u2019d think it would be at least mildly interesting, but the movie is sluggish and packed with conversational and head-scratching filler that lends nothing to the story.\r\n\r\nThere is a wacky cast of (too many) characters, and only a handful turn out to be memorable. The expected roster of Anderson regulars make an appearance (Jason Schwartzman, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson) as well as big names that are new to working with the director (Bryan Cranston, Tom Hanks, Maya Hawke, Matt Dillon, Steve Carell, Liev Schreiber, Hong Chau, Jake Ryan). It\u2019s a dream of a cast list, but this film goes to show that a talented roster doesn\u2019t always result in a gem. There\u2019s nothing wrong with any of the performances, but it\u2019s the source material that needs a lot of work.\r\n\r\n\u201cAsteroid City\u201d may be visually delightful, but it is filled with a detached, hipster indifference that\u2019s off-putting. This is one of the biggest failures of the year, and it\u2019s not because the film is \u201ctoo Wes Anderson-y,\u201d nor is it because of the general Anderson fatigue: this movie is a series of flagrant missteps that cause the project to flounder and fall.", "Top tongue-in-cheek directors: Wes Anderson and Wen Jiang. Asteroid City isn't my favorite Wes film, but it's surely tongue-in-cheek and pretty damn funny.\r\n\r\nThis movie reminds me a little of Tennessee Williams, the all-time master of damaged and traumatized human psyches. I see this work as a treatise on human issues, especially the labels given to us by others and those we give ourselves, and how they affect one's life and relationships.\r\n\r\nThe partial view of the \"Confessions of a Narcissist\" marquis that showed up in the background of the tet-a-tet between Augie and his almost-onstage-wife is a clue. The term \"narcissist\" didn't become popular psychology until the 1980s. There were other anachronisms, but this one is particularly striking in context.\r\n\r\nAnd what's with that song and dance number in the middle of the show? The band that showed up in this desert had no other raison d'etre!! Did Wes just reference the Time Warp from The Rocky Horror Picture Show??", "There is a void to fill regarding a yearly _Thanksgiving_ franchise. The Carver is outrageous enough to be more enjoyable if Eli Roth allows other directors to play in his grotesque cornbread-stuffing-filled sandbox in future installments.

And I say that as someone who has worked as a guard in prisons and mental institutions. There are a few extremely minor inaccuracies but these are necessary for the plot or are for safety reasons (after all, not everyone needs to know what exactly the actual safety measures in a prison actually look like in detail).\r\n\r\nThere actually already is an almost identical German movie called \"Der Totmacher\" (The Deathmaker). Though I am sure no one involved in this movie saw it, even though it's essentially the same movie and that's because that German movie's entire script simply consists entirely of the actual transcripts of an actual psychological evaluation of an actual serial killer. But that's how close to reality this all actually is.", "EXT. INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF THE LOST DIALS SKULL \u2013 DAY\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is more closely related to its recent sequel than its distant cousins of the original trilogy. It attempts to take the franchise's formula and shake it up; it throws in cameos, call-backs and references but suffers the same issue every recent Lucasfilm movie has. \r\n\r\nIt's another modern Disney reboot sequel with legacy characters left in the dirt, and a 'quirky & quippy' new character is presented to us. You know this character type when in the face of fear, they will make fun of the villain's Lactose Intolerance or something random because this character is flawlessly confident. They are knowledgeable on every subject relevant to the plot, smartasses because they are always correct, sassy when held hostage and always have an escape plan. This is Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridges), and she might be the only consistent character in the film. For the rest of the ensemble, Boyd Holbrooks Klaber speaks once in the movie and then chases after Jones in each scene; Mads Mikkelsens J\u00fcrgen Voller is the most forgettable antagonist of the franchise, Antonio Banderas is out of the film faster than he's in it and finally, Harrison Ford as Dr Jones is unfortunately back for what seems like a pretty good paycheck.\r\n\r\nI have nothing against the performances themselves. The cast is incredibly talented, but this skilled team cannot hide the terrible dialogue reinforcing the rather forgettable story. Ultimately, Indiana Jones has one of the greatest trilogies of films with a distance spin-off universe of sequels. Lucasfilm, post-2008, has not been your era.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT.", "\r\nI really like the Indie series, so I take no pleasure in saying, I found this unwatchable. \r\n\r\nReally US entertainment industry, when are you going to get the message that a lot of us aren't interested in \"the message\".\r\n\r\nIn summary, great cast, great sets, horrible script, full of the usual lecturing no one asked for. ", "_Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_ feels like the type of sequel that aimed to capture the magic of its predecessors, had worthwhile intentions, and a talented cast, but it just never properly materialized. The film seems to teeter on the sheer annoyance of a main character grappling with the fact that he\u2019s now a crotchety and wrinkly senior citizen and not the young, grizzled, adventurer he used to be.\r\n\r\nWith an ending that leaves the Indiana Jones character in a satisfying bookend for the franchise, hopefully _The Dial of Destiny_ is the final Indy film. Like Roger Murtaugh in _Lethal Weapon_, Harrison Ford is literally too old for this sh*t.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/destinysdial", "It took me a while to work up the courage to see this.  I mean, Indiana Jones was my hero as a child.  When I was sick I used to watch Raiders over and over again and that was a tradition I kept up through high school.\r\n\r\nAnd now... Thank you Doomcock, without your intervention this movie would have been even worse.  It shows, the plot is messy, the re-shoots are a little obvious story-wise as Disney did their best to attempt to avoid the fan backlash promised for when their plans were to kill Indy off and have Phoebe replace him....\r\n\r\n... and then when when they re-shoot it again because the fans didn't want to see Indiana Jones be ridiculed constantly by his female replacement in an effort to make the KK stand-in come across as better in every way... and a lot of that is still there in the final product.\r\n\r\nLike Star Wars did to Skywalker, Indiana Jones is constantly shamed by the younger more diverse version... who can't seem to decide what character she wants to be.  Rogue?  Scholar?  Conman? Her personality changes as the script dictates, but Indiana remains pathetic... so that Strong Female Lead can look better.\r\n\r\nIn the end it's a mess, and the result is that Disney killed another fan favorite Franchise.  Star Wars, Willow, and now Indy.  They paid out the nose for all of them and then made them worthless.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of conspiracies floating around about it, but it don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.", "\u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d is a stale, impotent summer blockbuster that marks another unimaginative entry in the popular adventure franchise. Excessively dull and far too long, director James Mangold\u2018s movie burns every last drop of goodwill that\u2019s left in the tank. This fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones saga is a pathetic sendoff to one of the most iconic big screen characters of all time.\r\n\r\nSet in 1969, Daredevil archaeologist Henry \u201cIndiana\u201d Jones (Harrison Ford) is still working as a professor, but today is his retirement day. In his final class, a young woman from his past turns up: his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She\u2019s in search of a mystical device that her father Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) obsessed over until the day he died, and Indy knows its historical significance all too well. It\u2019s been said that the Antikythera (the Greek name for the Dial of Destiny), can alter the course of history and time, and it would turn any person who held it into a god. Soon Indy and Helena find out that former Nazi and current NASA scientist J\u00fcrgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) also wants the device for himself so he can change the outcome of World War II, and it becomes a race against time (and a very dangerous enemy) if they want to save history as the world knows it.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a bad story overall, but it certainly is a mess of one. It\u2019s extremely slow, and the most interesting parts happen in the film\u2019s final 45 minutes. That means there\u2019s an abundance of bland filler and tepid action chase scenes that fill screen time before all the good stuff happens. There\u2019s a lot of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at play here, as Mangold tries to milk fond memories of the earlier (and best) \u201cRaiders\u201d films, and he\u2019s not shy about masking his intentions. The film brings back classic characters like Marion (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who only briefly appear as a means of tugging on the heartstrings (and reminding audiences of far, far better movies).\r\n\r\nThere are so many missteps in this film that it becomes more of a bore than a fun means of escapism. The opening sequence is a little fun, but it\u2019s too reminiscent of the circus train intro in \u201cLast Crusade.\u201d There\u2019s another tuk tuk chase that\u2019s eerily familiar to the mine cars in \u201cTemple of Doom.\u201d The script (which credits four writers) inserts plenty of winks and nudges as it references the most classic Indiana Jones films. While the crack of Indy\u2019s whip and the moment he dons his famous brown fedora may get those feel-good endorphins flowing, it also makes in painfully clear that a movie can only coast so far on nostalgia.\r\n\r\nA large chunk of the problem is (surprisingly) with the character. An archaeologist outsmarting Nazi villains feels more dated in today\u2019s society than it should, even though the film is set in the late \u201960s. Indiana Jones will always be a classic of course, and the studio should be applauded for its decision not to recast Ford in what is in the top two of his most iconic roles. What\u2019s cringey is the use of de-aging software for the scenes that take place in the past, which makes Ford look plastic, fake, and straight out of a Pixar movie. It doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s distracting, and it arguably was unnecessary within the confines of the story the film is trying to tell.\r\n\r\nOne of the positives is that Ford is clearly still a movie star, and he holds the movie together with what appears to be minimal effort. Yes, it\u2019s easy to tell when a stunt person is standing in and it\u2019s obvious through some clever (and choppy) editing that Ford wasn\u2019t personally able to perform all of the physicality the role demanded, but he still lives and breathes Indiana Jones, so much so that after a little bit of time, you don\u2019t even see him as an old man. The addition of Waller-Bridge adds a refreshing spark to the film, and her character and performance are quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d will perform well across generations, but Gen Xers and older audiences will be delighted to see one of their favorite characters back in his own action / adventure story. What a pity this is the best sendoff that could be mustered for Indy after all this time.", "\"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" delivers exactly what fans of the iconic adventurer have been yearning for\u2014a thrilling, action-packed adventure that pays homage to the franchise's rich history while introducing new and captivating elements.\r\n\r\nHarrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones with the same charm and charisma that has made him a beloved cinematic icon for decades. Ford effortlessly slips back into the fedora and whip, proving that age has only added depth to the character. His portrayal is a masterclass in blending wit, humor, and vulnerability, reminding us why Indiana Jones is an enduring hero.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast shines as well, with standout performances from newcomers and familiar faces alike. The chemistry between Ford and his co-stars is palpable, adding depth to the relationships at the core of the film. Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character, in particular, brings a refreshing and feisty dynamic to the story.\r\n\r\nThe film's plot is a rollercoaster ride of suspense and intrigue. From the moment the adventure begins, it never lets up, taking us on a globe-trotting quest filled with ancient mysteries, treacherous traps, and high-stakes encounters. \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" skillfully weaves historical and mythological elements into the narrative, providing a satisfying blend of history and fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. The film's use of practical effects and practical stunts harks back to the franchise's roots and sets it apart from modern CGI-laden blockbusters. Each action set piece is meticulously choreographed and filled with heart-pounding moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat.\r\n\r\nJohn Williams' iconic score is the icing on the cake, evoking a sense of nostalgia while adding new layers to the film's atmosphere. The music enhances every scene, amplifying the emotional resonance of key moments.\r\n\r\n\"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" also succeeds in exploring the character's personal journey and growth. It delves into Indy's motivations, regrets, and his enduring quest for knowledge and adventure, giving the character a deeper and more relatable dimension.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" is a triumphant return to the beloved franchise. It manages to capture the essence of what makes Indiana Jones an enduring hero while introducing fresh elements to keep the series exciting and relevant. It's a must-see for fans and a thrilling adventure for newcomers, proving that the magic of Indiana Jones is as strong as ever.", "I took my daughter along to see this, naively expecting light, family friendly fun and well, its not.

It _superbly_ voices the internal contradictions women need to navigate to be accepted. It works hard not to centre Ken, even while his role is a critical counterpoint, but also gives a little airtime to how much a male-dominated world makes it hard to be a man too.\r\n\r\nThe writing is out of this world, the pacing is spot on, and Margot Robbie utterly _nails_ the role \u2014 especially the emotional and physical aspects of being a doll in a way that playfully nods to the many ways that children play with Barbie.\r\n\r\nIt's a wonderful film that I'd encourage everyone to see. It's _hard_ to watch, as a man\u2014feeling responsible for so many challenges women face\u2014but Barbie doesn't judge, it voices.

Writer-director Greta Gerwig\u2019s latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that\u2019s about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What\u2019s more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like \u201cwriting\u201d than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, \u201cBarbie\u201d does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I\u2019ll easily forget before year\u2019s end \u2013 and one that conclusively proves the power of marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted.", "McKinnon and Gosling's acting is great, and the dance numbers are really well done. But the story is very weak -- the Gloria/Sasha tie-in felt ham-fisted and the 'bonding' Barbie has at the end with Ruth makes no sense in the context of the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that throughout the whole movie you're being hit over the head with a message that they *really* want to make sure you understand (how many times can you say 'patriarchy'?)

Needless to say, she wasn't best pleased and so now, some time after, he heads to Portugal to try to make amends (and so the crew can get some sun). Of course what he really wants is to reunite with \"Tessa\" but can he grow up enough to realise the errors of his ways and to reconcile with her? Well I really could not have cared less. Initially I found Tiffin to have a little charm about him, but now this part has been well and truly exhausted and he has neither that charm nor any charisma to bring to a role that really consists of a pretty odious and self-indulgent character. There's lots of familial discord, an on/off drink problem (probably for us watching, too) and the ending was more like a sigh of relief for all concerned. I know, I'm not the demographic - but money has been spent on this - and it's money that could have been better spent on - well, just about anything.

IF U CAN'T WATCH SIENTIFIC HISTORY JUST DON'T GO.", "Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that\u2019s precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan\u2019s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and na\u00efve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist\u2019s life, chronicles his development of \u201cthe gadget\u201d and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer\u2019s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture\u2019s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering\u2019s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.", "Cillian Murphy, so hot right now. Film is a little long though.", "The intersection of innovation, science, political bureaucracy, and ethics meet in writer-director Christopher Nolan\u2018s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a dark, challenging biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it\u2019s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.\r\n\r\nThere has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that\u2019s a far cry from what I\u2019d call \u201centertaining.\u201d It\u2019s a great movie that\u2019s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn\u2019t really worth it.\r\n\r\nNolan\u2019s film is poignant in a way that\u2019s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that\u2019s plaguing society. There\u2019s a very real moral question about humanity\u2019s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan\u2019s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.\r\n\r\nNolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer\u2019s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover\u2019s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won\u2019t be completely lost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn\u2019t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it\u2019s refreshing to see a riveting movie that\u2019s made for thinking audiences.", "The cinematic masterpiece that is Oppenheimer leaves an indelible impression on anyone who watches it. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this film, delivering a poignant message about the horrors of nuclear war. The superb direction and exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and others draw you into the story, making you feel as though you are right there in the midst of it all. Even though there aren't any action scenes, the movie still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire 3-hour runtime.

What a shame that it\u2019s buried under a heap of dreadfully unfunny attempts at humor, dumb pratfalls,and tired sex jokes that fall flat one hundred percent of the time. No bones about it: this is not just a really terrible comedy, it\u2019s an awful movie all around.\r\n\r\nBartender Maddie (Jennifer Lawrence) just watched her car get towed from the driveway, and needs wheels, fast. While browsing the want ads, she stumbles upon an intriguing job listing: wealthy helicopter parents (Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick) are searching for someone to \u201cdate\u201d their introverted 19-year-old son, Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman), before he leaves for college. The pay for sleeping with their son? A used Buick. Maddie decides to take the job but in the process, she gets far more than she bargains for.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a decent premise for a movie, but Lawrence is horribly miscast in the role. She\u2019s too old to play the part of Maddie, which makes her relationship with a teenager feel a little icky. Lawrence is also called on to do a lot of comedy work and as talented as she is, she simply lacks the knack for comedic timing (she\u2019s especially awful at physical comedy).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also a problematic message to send to young men: if you haven\u2019t slept with a woman before venturing away from home and off into adulthood, then you aren\u2019t much of a \u201cman.\u201d Just think if the roles were reversed here, and it was a 32 year old man trying to force himself on a 19 year old woman so she could get \u201cexperience\u201d before heading to college. The standard needs to be the same regardless of the sex of the main characters.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the story consists of ridiculous situations where Maddie is aggressively trying to seduce Percy, none of them funny and all of them growing old, quickly. Stupnitsky (and co-writer John Phillips) go for the lowest hanging fruit every time, and the only laughter I could muster while watching this dreck came from forced chuckles.\r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the major problem with the movie: everyone is trying so hard to turn it into a wacky, racy comedy that they miss the actual heart of the story.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between Maddie and Percy is somewhat charming, and the way they grow individually while together is actually heartwarming. All of that is overshadowed by the lame attempts to make it a raunchy, sexy, adult comedy. In struggling to be both, it succeeds at neither.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo Hard Feelings\u201d is best when it stops trying to be something it\u2019s not.", "Something Something Grooming... yeah, I didn't really get that vibe from this movie.\r\n\r\nBut it was creepy that a kids parents would basically pay someone off to... doink... their son.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately it doesn't work, Jennifer Lawrence is just a horrible person in this.  From pretty much start-to-finish she is a horrible human being, and in order for this story to work she needs to be likeable.  She needs to be relatable.  She needs to be someone that the male protagonist would actually fall for...\r\n\r\n... and instead she's the type of person that you don't want to know.  She's not even a rougish charmer.  She's not a lovable con artist.  She's just completely unappealing.  And that is why the film doesn't work.\r\n\r\nAndrew Barth Feldman comes across as legitimately socially awkward, but he also comes across as someone that doesn't want to be around her, and doesn't like her because of her completely toxic qualities.  \r\n\r\nThe script is at least aware enough to include that... but then does a 180 where he has to pretend that, after dealing with her, he actually wants to be around her... because the plot requires it.\r\n\r\nFor some reason he doesn't want to have sex with her because HE is awkward, not because she is awful. Which makes it a little unbelievable.  \r\n\r\nI suppose in their effort to show that Jennifer don't need no man, they forget that they were making her into someone no one would want to be around long enough to bang.

Emigration, discrimination, and family ideals are some of the many essential topics addressed.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the criticism surrounding the alleged \"fall of Pixar\" and this latest movie. I will continue to enjoy these stories, and I highly recommend that viewers try to do the same, without worrying about incessantly comparing to what came before.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "\"Elemental\" is an outstanding Pixar movie that utilizes the medium of animation to tell a compelling story. It goes beyond being just a rom-com and instead offers a powerful narrative about people, even though the characters represent elements. Pixar effectively uses various elements to convey a captivating human story that resonates with viewers. The film highlights the idea that despite our differences, we can coexist in a society that often tries to separate us. \"Elemental\" stands out as one of the most visually colourful movies with excellent music, including a memorable end credits song.

What's wrong with this film, though, is that it attempts to inflict a plot on what has been essentially, up to now, a series of (very) soft porn dance routines that allow those of us to relish some fit young blokes parading their abs and asses whilst giving us a good old dose of raunch! This offers very little of that, even at the end - and as such the thing struggles to engage. There are the odd moments that raise a smile, but Hayek overacts dreadfully and Tatum spends too much of his time standing around with his hands in his pockets as both deliver a rather strained and contrived dialogue. Simply, not enough happens on stage here and, well, let's hope it is, indeed, his last dance - this is poor, sorry.", "\u201cAir\u201d is a sports marketing drama that delivers satisfying entertainment with a feel-good, universal appeal. Never would I have guessed that a film about business deals and shoe marketing would be so engaging, but this true story about the game-changing partnership in 1984 between an NBA rookie named Michael Jordan and the athletic apparel company Nike is gratifying on all levels. You don\u2019t have to be a basketball fan or even know anything about Jordan to enjoy this film. It\u2019s a biopic all right \u2013 but of the men behind the Air Jordan sneaker line, not the superstar athlete.\r\n\r\nDirected by Ben Affleck (who also co-stars), the film explores the history of how the legendary Air Jordan sneaker line was birthed into existence, telling the story of the high-stakes business gamble that had the potential to make or break Nike.\r\n\r\nWhen scout and basketball division lead Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) sets his sights on the talented UNC rookie (who has recently been drafted by the Chicago Bulls) to be the athlete that Nike needs to boost their shoe line, he is met with resistance from his team of reluctant colleagues. They\u2019re skeptical at first, but eventually find Sonny\u2019s passion to be contagious and hop on board.\r\n\r\nMuch of the narrative is focused on the behind-the-scenes company men, discussions about money, and valid concerns about taking a huge risk on Sonny\u2019s gut feeling that this kid has the potential to become an international sports superstar. There\u2019s a lot shown about the creativity process, brainstorming sessions, and outside-the-box marketing that helped Nike sell their shoes to an up-and-coming NBA player. Although it may sound like it, this isn\u2019t a dry business story, but an enjoyable film filled with casual charm.\r\n\r\nAffleck includes a who\u2019s who of Nike in the 80s, from Peter Moore (Matthew Maher), Nike\u2019s Creative Director and the man who designed the Air Jordan sneaker (and also had the brilliant idea to put Jordan\u2019s silhouette on the product line), Howard White (Chris Tucker), who influenced the basketball player to sign with the company, Marketing Director Rob Strasser (Jason Bateman), and Nike co-founder Phil Knight (Affleck), who credits the Air Jordan as the product that saved his company.\r\n\r\nA secondary plot line involves Sonny\u2019s efforts to convince Jordan\u2019s bulldog agent David Falk (Chris Messina) and family, in particular his smart and savvy mother Deloris (Viola Davis), to sign with Nike over the more popular competing brands Converse and Adidas. Discussions between Sonny and Deloris deliver the film\u2019s most powerful scenes, especially when you see a tenacious mother who knows her son\u2019s worth and has no problem holding her own in a room full of corporate suits. It\u2019s unusual to find a film that keeps the audience invested in the story from both sides, and I found myself hoping for Sonny to land a great contract but also for Deloris to get the best deal possible for her son and family.\r\n\r\nTo reveal more about the story would constitute major spoilers, especially if you are unfamiliar with the history of the shoe, but Affleck\u2019s storytelling is so engaging that it will keep you emotionally invested even if you know the eventual outcome.\r\n\r\nAs a director, Affleck has an enviable, natural flair for telling true stories. His casual style and instincts are on full display here. The film is an example of one of those instances that are few and far between, where the subject matter is the perfect match for the director. This is a story that obviously is close to Affleck\u2019s heart, and it\u2019s reflected throughout the film.\r\n\r\n\u201cAir\u201d is a well-made movie about the American Dream from two different sides of the equation. There aren\u2019t many missteps here, and everything from the direction, lively screenplay (written by Alex Convery), and warm performances all flow together in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "Slightly forced 1980s aesthetic/nostalgia trip aside, <em>'Air'</em> is quality!\r\n\r\nThe 80s was before my time, so I guess I'm not best placed to talk about it, but the constant shots of 80s things with 80s music with extremely 80s enviroments did get a tiny bit tiresome to me. I recall people saying similar-ish with <em>'Stranger Things'</em> season 3, though I found the mix of it there to more befitting. I'm nit-picking, I know, but it just was super noticeable to me here.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of that unimportant stuff. The film is great. The whole cast do terrific work, particularly Matt Damon, Viola Davis (the phone call scene between those two is excellent), Jason Bateman and Ben Affleck. I'd say the secondary portion of the almost 2hrs is the stronger, prior to that I was intrigued but not invested... by the end I was both. It's a predictable story, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThe decision to practically not have a Michael Jordan character in a movie about Michael Jordan is an interesting one. It feels a tad awkward when he is in a scene and they intentionally 'hide' him. I get why, and it mostly works, but it does feel dorky at a point or two.\r\n\r\nOverall, very good.

THE ANATOMY OF ANATOMY OF A FALL - DAY</b>\r\n<i>Anatomy of a Fall</i> is an excellent film crafted from the mind of Justine Triet. It's beautifully acted, shot, scored and edited together. So let's look at the Anatomy of <i>Anatomy of a Fall</i>.\r\n \r\nStory:\r\nThe story revolves around the unconfirmed cause of death of <i>Samuel</i>, who has fallen out of his attic window. The only person in the house was his wife <i>Sandra</i>, <b>Sandra H\u00fcller</b>, the prime suspect. Their son <i>Daniel</i>, blind from an unfortunate event, is the only witness. The story is from the perspective of <i>Sandra</i>, and just like any courtroom drama, details are revealed over time. Fortunately, it's at a steady pace, never announcing too much or too little, giving us the correct information at the right time. While I'm mostly positive about the story, some moments slow right down, and we come to a standstill; overall, thanks to the following few components, they considerably make up for the story's flaws. \r\n\r\nPerformance: \r\nIts lead is <i>Anatomy of a Fall's</i> greatest asset, <b>Sandra H\u00fcller</b>. She is tremendous, pulling no punches in the role of Sandra, the deceased's wife. For the rest of the cast, no one except the dog is ever greater than Sandra! \r\n\r\nCinematography: \r\nThe camera in this film is on a swivel, always moving, keeping us engaged. The camera uses Visual humour quite a bit, which is always great to see. Finally, the colour grade felt natural and, at times, warm, giving a homely vibe. \r\n\r\nScore:\r\nA simple piano piece plays throughout the film; it is excellent. \r\nFinally, the editing:\r\nThis was a stand-out for me. It was cleverly cutting at points to hide us from the horrors but holding onto moments before it became too much. \r\nThere's a lot of love about this film \u2014 a highlight of the Cannes 2023 run. \r\n\r\n<b>FADE OUT.</b>", "The new Equalizer film franchise is devoid of the moderation, charm and gentlemanly grace of the original television series, with Edward Woodward.\r\n\r\nInstead, its mired in gratuitous, humiliating, dehumanising violence, with a key character who feels more like the Terminator, than an assassin with a conscience. In short its ugly stuff. I managed about 15 minutes of this, before calling it a day.

This is a positively dreadful film, and I\u2019m at a complete loss to understand how viewers have found it funny. When a pair of lesbian high school students (Rachel Sennott, Ayo Edebiri) establish a fight club (i.e., a euphemistically labeled \u201cself-defense program\u201d) as a means to surreptitiously bed down their cheerleader classmates (a story line that\u2019s more than a little dubious in itself), they subsequently launch into a meandering narrative that makes little sense and plays like it was made up by a group of stoners who\u2019ll laugh at anything when suitably smoked up. The film starts out trying way too hard and then proceeds to quickly go downhill from there. Much of the material is in questionable taste, too, such as sequences that feature unrestrained physical abuse against women, as well as other forms of sanctioned violence. How is this stuff supposed to be funny? \u201cBottoms\u201d has been described by viewers and critics as a go-for-broke/anything-for-a-laugh comedy, but I found its distasteful stabs at humor cringeworthy at best. What\u2019s more, the picture\u2019s feeble attempts at trying to inject the narrative with a message related to women\u2019s empowerment are completely betrayed by its many wrong-headed plot devices. To the film\u2019s credit, it does feature some passable performances by its supporting cast (most notably Punkie Johnson, Dagmara Dominczyk and former NFL star Marshawn Lynch). But, sadly, this effort is a big step down for director Emma Seligman and writer-actor Rachel Sennott, both of whom turned in brilliant work in their raucous collaboration, \u201cShiva, Baby\u201d (2020) (not to mention that Sennott\u2019s casting represents a laughable choice for someone who\u2019s nearly 28 attempting to portray an 18-year-old character). It\u2019s also quite a comedown for producer Elizabeth Banks, who scored big earlier this year with the utterly hilarious \u201cCocaine Bear.\u201d It occurred to me after watching this debacle that maybe I\u2019m just getting old and losing my sense of humor, but, after thinking it over, I realized that\u2019s genuinely not the case. This may indeed represent a case of changing movie tastes, but, if that\u2019s so, I\u2019m seriously troubled about the direction in which those tastes are headed.", "\"PJ\" (Rachel Sennott) and her best mate \"Josie\" (Ayo Edebiri) are starting the new year at school confident that they won't get laid!

Meantime, cheating school heart-throb \"Jeff\" (Nicholas Galitzine) is having a row with his girlfriend \"Isabel\" (Havana Rose Liu) that sees the latter take refuge with the girls in their car and the most minuscule of car accidents reduce this macho lad to a gibbering wreck! This is what inspires our duo to start a club at school that will ostensibly teach young women the basics of self defence whilst allowing them to maybe get some \"fun\" into the bargain! What now ensues is all rather puerile, I found. Maybe it's supposed to be satire, but that any school would allow the pupils to use the gym to beat each other up - under the supervision of a teacher - is just preposterous. The characterisations are just about as shallow as you can get and the writers need to appreciate that using the full gamut of Anglo-Saxon expletives doesn't actually make a film funny. As it lumbers on it becomes more and more cringe-worthy until a denouement that is just like something left on the cutting room floor from an edition of \"Happy Days\". I get that I'm not the demographic, but this is still a weakly constructed, over-acted and rather aggressive reinforcement of just about every stereotype there might be in an American school - and none of these people come off very well.", "**Scream VI cranks up the violence, paranoia, and chaos but also enhances the character development and story, making the new directors' second entry even better than I had hoped!**\r\n\r\nI have been hyped and anxiously anticipating this movie since the final moments of finishing Scream (2022) in theaters - and it did not disappoint! The Radio Silence team (Bettinnelli-Olpin and Gillett) prove they are the perfect new shepherds of the franchise. The four young survivors take giant leaps in character development as they grapple with the trauma, fallout, and spotlight of the last film's events. Their loyalty and care for each other draw immediate similarities to Sidney, Dewey, and Gale, which quickly endear the \"Core Four\" as beloved characters you desperately want to survive. The danger, kills, and gore all have been cranked up a notch, and for the first time in the franchise, even the survivors are possible Ghostfaces. I doubt and suspect everyone while simultaneously caring for them - that is masterful writing right there! On top of all that, having another legacy character back with Kirby Reed returning was fantastic. I loved this movie, but I really missed Dewey and Sidney. I also think the main Ghostface killer is a little too over the top when revealed, which keeps Scream (1996) and Scream (2022) ahead on my list. But those are incredibly minor complaints! Scream VI is another exceptional entry in the Scream franchise, and I hope we get another one soon!", "Pretty much what I expected from the fifth installment of a franchise that ended after its second - i.e., bad. Gale Weathers makes an appearance, but the original cast is gone.\r\n\r\nAt the start, the main character walks up to some guy and says 'I'm gonna taze you in the balls', and does so. Instead of spending the rest of the movie in a jail cell on sexual assault charges, and then getting sued into the ground, the film just goes on. (The victim was a white male, so modern hollywood wants you to think it's 'funny' rather than disgusting.) From that point on, the main character is in no way an innocent victim, so it's hard to care that she's being pursued by a killer. The plot is mediocre, there are no funny or cool characters that the viewer might actually care about, and the killer's identity has reached the level of 'roommate's friend's brother's dogwalker', aka 'who cares'. Very forgetable.", "Now don't judge. You mustn't judge. If you do this will come across as the most atrocious piece of cinema since \"Mesa of Lost Women\" (1953). \"Christopher Robin\" (Nikolai Leon) is taking his fiancee back to the wood in which he played with \"Pooh\", \"Piglet\", \"Eyeore\" etc. as a child. What he doesn't appreciate, though, is that in the intervening years things got tough for his erstwhile friends. They couldn't fend for themselves, and were reduced to cannibalism to survive.... Aside from altering the balance of their tiny mids, this also instilled in \"Pooh\" and \"Piglet\" a grim and determined need for vengeance. What now ensues is hilarious. What ever budget there was must have been spent on gin for the cast: the costumes and lighting are pretty dreadful and the script - well that is almost as bad as the acting. Leon is quite easy on the eye, but the sight of him being whipped to within an inch of his life with the tail of \"Eyeore\" by a large man in an ill-fitting yellow bear suit whose mouth was oozing honey like a drooling bairn just has to be seen. Cinema can be too earnest and worthy at times, and I think this is the perfect recalibration for that - it is certainly neither, nor is it a film you will ever (want to) remember after you've seen it. Still, the cinema was packed and there was laughter a-plenty throughout the eighty minutes or so this risible drivel lasted. It could easily be a school project - nothing here is of an higher standard, and it did make me squirm at times as the 1970s \"Doctor Who\" special effects department came back to life - but I didn't hate it.", "Rhys Frake-Waterfield... what in god's name have you done.\r\n\r\nLet me preface this with a note that I am no stranger to horror, terrible horror, and finding enjoyment in what the masses hated.\r\n\r\nI went into this knowing this was a godawful movie.

There are a lot of vapid scenes that do nothing to further the narrative, and the film has close to zero story or plot. Astute viewers (to be honest, even those who have only seen a handful of Hallmark movies) will figure out the big surprise long before its overlong reveal, leaving most of the audience bored, trying to savor the lovely scenery of the Italian countryside.\r\n\r\nThe cast is terrific, but I wouldn\u2019t call what they\u2019re doing \u201cacting.\u201d It\u2019s more like a camera has been turned on a group of old friends having fun together.

Thankfully, however, those days are largely behind us now, and speaking about them openly and honestly has become much more rational and commonplace. Such is the case in this new offering from directors Stephen Gray and Chris Radtke, who provide a comprehensive look at a subject that was once considered suspect \u2013 even laughable \u2013 but is now taken quite seriously, including by those who were once among its greatest detractors. The film presents a detailed look at the phenomenon, featuring interviews with such researchers as Raymond Moody, often credited as being primarily responsible for bringing NDEs into the mainstream dialogue, and experiencers of these events. It also presents a series of NDE re-enactments, including depictions of what led up to them and what happened as the experiences unfolded, all backed by stunningly gorgeous CGI effects of an admittedly indescribable reality and a beautifully emotive original score. This combination of elements thus provides an excellent overview of what make up NDEs while simultaneously conveying the obviously heartfelt emotions associated with them, bringing the experiences home to viewers in a way that other documentaries on the subject haven\u2019t previously been able to accomplish. It sheds profound light on what can happen when one goes through these existential gateways and how returnees are often fundamentally changed by the experiences, giving them new outlooks on life and their purpose in it. While it\u2019s true that this offering doesn\u2019t present much that\u2019s especially new about NDEs and that its pacing can be a little slow (and redundant) at times, it nevertheless does a superb job of immersing audiences in the material, again, a big improvement over previous attempts at addressing this subject. And pay no heed to the cynics who have erroneously called this little more than religious propaganda; while it\u2019s true there are a handful of Christian-oriented references scattered throughout the film, the overall take here is more spiritual in nature, an ecumenical approach at examining the afterlife than one that\u2019s exclusively rooted in any particular theological tradition. Viewers who may have been skeptical, unfamiliar with or skittish about this subject may find themselves surprisingly enlightened by what this release has to say. And the fact that it\u2019s playing widely in mainstream theaters to astonishingly well-attended audiences also speaks volumes about the appeal and apparent universality of this title. As this film so astutely shows, death isn\u2019t the end \u2013 and it\u2019s high time we stopped looking at it that way.", "The one thing a good whodunnit should not do is put its audience to sleep. Unfortunately, this latest cinematic adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel fails miserably on this score. Director Kenneth Branagh\u2019s third outing as Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot is a protracted snooze that leaves viewers caring little about the characters and even less about the story in which they\u2019re trapped. When the famed detective (Branagh) \u2013 now in retirement in Venice \u2013 is called upon by a friend and author of murder mysteries (Tina Fey) to help her verify or discredit the psychic powers of a medium (Michelle Yeoh) at a s\u00e9ance at an allegedly haunted Venetian palazzo, he\u2019s drawn into yet another of his famous investigations. The problem here is that what should be an engaging story is interminably dull, one that, regrettably, prompts frequent checking of one\u2019s watch. Moreover, virtually the entire film is shot with excessively dark camera work (so much for showing off the glories of Venice). And then there are the performances, which feature good turns by Yeoh and Jude Hill but a positively wooden portrayal by Branagh (compared to his previous depictions of the protagonist) and an absolutely dreadful performance by a woefully miscast Fey. To its credit, like its recent predecessors, the production values of this Christie offering are top shelf, but that\u2019s about all this release has going for it, a far cry from the much better overall work found in \u201cMurder on the Orient Express\u201d (2017) and \u201cDeath on the Nile\u201d (2023). Indeed, even fans of the famed mystery writer are likely to find \u201cA Haunting in Venice\u201d tiresome and tedious. Pack a lunch for this one.", "With heavy influences from Studio Ghibli\u2019s _Spirited Away_ and _Howl\u2019s Moving Castle_, _Deep Sea_ is the best animated film of the year that most won\u2019t see or even know about.

And it took less than a year.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it has a plot, a Kraken trying to pass as human turns into a Kraken and meh-essaging.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, it's another cartoon that cares more about pushing a political message than it does entertaining the audience.\r\n\r\nAnd it's made for children... do you really want to bring little boys to a movie who's primary narrative is that white males are evil and irredeemably so?  That sort of message isn't exactly child friendly, unless you are raising your child to hate.", "The numerous manuals on my shelves for 1st to 5e speak volumes of my familiarity with the game, as does the novels I own, and the numerous D&D computer games I've played, so I was ecstatic seeing the places, people, and creatures I know very well. I've heard others who have played the game say they wished they had done a movie about characters like Elminster, Drizzt Do'Urden, or Alias instead. While they would have been nice to see, those characters are from the lore not the game. What I was more hoping for was that the characters in this movie felt like the characters the players play, the adventures they go on, and the antics they get themselves into. This movie felt like that in spades, and it was an absolute joy to see. I watched this and was constantly reminded of the crazy things I did as a player or watched others do as their DM, and more importantly the fun we had playing the game we all loved. This is why I give it my highest recommendation to all others who have played the game, and especially to those who have not so they may see for themselves what Dungeons & Dragons is really about. 8/10", "Based on the legendary role-playing game, \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d is nothing like what I anticipated and much better than I expected. This irresistible fantasy adventure has a healthy dose of good humor, playful charm, and is easily accessible to all who love imaginary worlds filled with wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, knights, and fire-breathing dragons.\r\n\r\nCharismatic thief Edgin (Chris Pine) and his band of unlikely adventurers (including Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) the barbarian) undertake an epic heist to retrieve a lost relic and to liberate his daughter (Chloe Coleman) from Forge\u2019s (Hugh Grant) castle. Things go dangerously awry when they run afoul of the wrong people, but the group must work together to overcome seemingly never-ending obstacles as they continue their important quest.\r\n\r\nWhile directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein stay true to the origins of the game, prior knowledge of Dungeons & Dragons isn\u2019t necessary. The film explains everything you need to know, making this an action adventure that\u2019s appropriate for everyone. It\u2019s surprising just how accessible this movie is. You don\u2019t have to know the rules of the game to get a real kick out of this one. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of Easter eggs hidden around for the gamers, but it\u2019s not so insider that the uninitiated can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. This is definitely one of the film\u2019s greatest strengths.\r\n\r\nThe story (with a script by Goldstein, Daley, and Michael Gilio) is solid too, with well-developed characters and irreverent humor that keeps the movie from becoming just another based-on-a-game throwaway. There\u2019s a ton of heart and genuine emotion, which is elevated by the terrific cast. The actors play off each other well, giving a human element to what thankfully is not just a bunch of dumb CGI. You can feel the real connection between Edgin and Holga, best friends who always have each other\u2019s backs, and Rodriguez and Pine\u2019s chemistry finds the perfect groove. Grant, who is having a career resurgence lately, is as delightful as ever as the rogue Forge Fitzwilliam, as is Justice Smith as amateur sorcerer Simon and Sophia Lillis as shape shifting tiefling druid Doric. Most shocking is that Pine isn\u2019t doing yet another version of his annoying shtick here, which in itself is a massive achievement.\r\n\r\nThe pacing is brisk and the special effects are well done, even if the finale is stretched a little thin. I found it easy to become engrossed in the mythical world of D&D not only because the movie looks great visually, but the characters are appealing, too. There\u2019s plenty to root for.\r\n\r\nEven if you think you aren\u2019t a fan of the fantasy genre, I suggest you give \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d a try. This playful, character-driven adventure offers a ton of magical fun at the movies.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / www.ScreenZealots.com**", "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that strikes a perfect balance between high fantasy and comedy.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay for the movie was pretty average in terms of the overall plot, but the individual story beats and set pieces really carried the movie forward. What makes the screenplay stand out is the creativity behind each character, giving them interesting scenes and moments to shine. The dialogue was sharp and witty, filled with great laughs throughout. However, some of the comedy was very generic, with jokes and physical comedy that have been done a dozen times over.\r\n\r\nThe performances in the film were very solid, with Chris Pine stealing the show as the lead. Pine was extremely witty and charismatic, with excellent comedic timing. Michelle Rodriguez, while playing a pretty flat character, had incredible action scenes. Rege-Jean Page was a standout in every scene he was in, with over-the-top and hilarious moments that left me in stitches. Justice Smith, who hasn't been one of my favorite actors, did well here as a great comedic character. Sophia Lillis, while not getting a ton of time to shine in terms of her acting chops, was amazing in her action set pieces, especially in the long sequence where her character shape shifts while escaping from the castle.\r\n\r\nThe direction of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves was surprisingly stellar. The action was sharp and well-choreographed, with minimal cuts allowing the audience to really get a larger grasp of what was happening. The film balanced comedy and high fantasy elements really well. While the shots weren't overly creative, the movie looked fantastic with beautiful landscapes and above-average CGI.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that exceeded my expectations. With a creative screenplay, solid performances, and fantastic direction, it deserves to be seen on the big screen.\r\n\r\nScore: 82%\r\nVerdict: Great", "A B grade action flick masquerading as a A list title. That's my reaction to Expendables 4.\r\n\r\nYes, its a tired formula but at least previous Expendable films in this cheesy action franchise, showed a little genuine enthusiasm and included a  cast of well worn but also well known, action stars. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, the latest flick is easily forgettable with a good number of cast members, I've never heard of or seen on screen, infrequently. \r\n\r\nIn summary, looks and behaves like a decidedly B grade action film with a sparse sprinkling of A grade action talent. Feels too, likes its going through the motions but not really delivering, if that makes sense.", "I love all 3 parts before this 3rd class movie. The story is classic not bad not good for this type of movies and lots of actors from the previous movies are missing, but they bring us Megan Fox and ruin everything. I hope that this will last movie in this series.", "I've watched a couple of former cinematic takes on Stephen Kings Boogeyman novel and this is by far, the least inspiring.\r\n\r\nThe real issue lies, in what can best be described, as the treatment of the tale of the cruel, child stalking creature, that potentially lives in every  closet.\r\n\r\nIts tone is obsessively analysing, of the dysfunctional family dynamic, to the point of neurosis. Yes, grieving families don't work too well, unsurprisingly. The less than optimistic over statement of this fact, overtakes the actual horror story. This, in turn, renders this film, too dark and too depressing, for its own good.\r\n\r\nThe results a predictable, not terribly enjoyable watch, that left this reviewer feeling a little washed out and disappointed. \r\n\r\nIn summary, the too dark and maudlin treatment, robs this film of the glimmer of hope, that lies at the heart of any half decent, horror film.", "Movie is really good, but there is one obvious flaw and one important condition:\r\n\r\nFlaw: you'll have to endure every scene about Jann's relationships.

Racing.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, let's return to the condition: you have to love it when cars go BRRRRR. The main reason behind this movie is to sell you GT7 for your PS5, and believe me, after leaving the cinema, you'll at least check if there are any discounts for the game right now (yes, there are). Sound, shooting angles, tension during races \u2014 everything works perfectly and beyond! Just when you become bored, you'll be in for a surprise. When you want a new angle, you'll get it. When you forget who the sponsor of the movie is, you'll see graphics from the video game.\r\n\r\nSo, just believe me, if you love races, you have to go to the movie right now. Just select cinema with quality sound, please :)\r\n\r\nAnd as a bonus, you'll get David Harbour, who's stealing absolutely every scene.

Being completely unaware of the inspirational true story on which the movie is based made it even more fascinating, engaging, and wildly exhilarating. Lorne Balfe and Andrew Kawczynski's score contains countless tracks loaded with extremely high levels of adrenaline that transform all racing sequences into moments of pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nExceptional performance by David Harbour, who commits himself to his role in such a way that, if the awards season started now and there was no clear dependence on marketing campaigns, the actor would be one of the frontrunners.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend not researching anything about the real story *before* the film, even if just to avoid dealing with the predictable, formulaic structure of this type of movie.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "**Wrong in so many levels.**\r\nBig fan of the game since PS1 till that day. Trailer gave me no thrills so i was expecting nothing but no! Way worse than trailer. \r\nGuys ! Even GT (is a half-sim) has some reality way more than this. For starters Whats with the Hungaroring? Silverstone Academy is reverse Hungaroring, Le Mans (La Sarthe) is regular Hungaroring.... \r\nIn racing there is no wiggly helmets; cars don't explodes, engines do, there are no spotters except ovals!; track races have qualies, you don't start in the middle of nowhere; you dont pass your opponent with down shifts and sudden throttle; GT3 cars are fast as any car on straights; Le Mans 24H doesn't finish at the last lap; it finishes at the end of 24 hours + 1 lap; Nurburgring is 20.83 km and if you crash in the middle of it nobody waves yellow flags in start-finish straight. I could have add more but i am already bored. \r\nGood soundtrack, good cinematography, well blended CGI but no soul and no technical aspect. I don't even know how Yamauchi San gave his blessing to this as himself a real deal racing driver. Lastly this film is the second DRIVEN disaster IMO.(4/10)", "FNAF was great, Kinda wish it had blood, Every kill was offscreen or really dark and you cant really see the kill.", "Didn't Josh Hutcherson used to be famous? Well here he is reduced to the role of the struggling brother of \"Abby\" (Piper Rubio). Their aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson) is determined that this hapless bag of bones isn't fit to look after the young girl - after he takes out a visiting father in the fountain of a shopping mall and gets fired; so \"Mike\" has to get another job! Opportunities are thin on the ground, but there is a vacancy doing the security night shift and an old, derelict, pizza parlour. How hard can it be? Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer \"Vanessa\" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take \"Abby\" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of \"Mike\" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.", "Director Guy Ritchie is no stranger to crafting exciting action films, but his latest project is quite different than his previous work. The narrative is linear, there aren\u2019t any montages, and the story isn\u2019t about criminals, gangsters, or Brits. Fans of Ritchie will absolutely still recognize his visual style (hello, overhead shots) and testosterone-fueled themes, but \u201cThe Covenant\u201d is a more dramatic, mature, and restrained work from the legendary director.\r\n\r\nSet during the war in Afghanistan in 2018, the film tells the story of U.S. Army sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his local Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim). Called a traitor by his people for helping the Americans, Ahmed has volunteered to seek revenge against the Taliban that killed his son. He has also been promised visas for his service so his family can flee to safety in America. After a lethal ambush in the desert, Kinley is gravely injured by enemy fire. With his platoon gone, Ahmed refuses to leave a fellow soldier behind to die, so he drags Kinley through the mountainous terrain in order to get him back to the base for medical help.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of their 100 mile journey, but then pivots to Kinley\u2019s return to the United States. It\u2019s months after he gets home that Kinley learns Ahmed and his family were not given safe passage as promised and, as a way to repay the debt he owes his friend, he returns to Afghanistan to retrieve them. It won\u2019t be easy, because Ahmed has been placed at the top of the Taliban\u2019s most wanted hit list.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a meaningful story of honor and brotherhood wrapped up in an intense wartime thriller. The story is told in three major acts, from the early days Ahmed and Kinley spent chasing IEDs, to their dangerous journey, to the red tape of getting a man what he\u2019s owed. There are plenty of thrilling acting sequences throughout, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat.\r\n\r\nRitchie has an extraordinary sense of timing and instincts for shooting action scenes, and the brutal, graphic wartime violence puts you in the be-or-be-killed survival mind of a front line solider. The director\u2019s visual storytelling is terrific here, as he switches between handheld shots with uneven movements to dizzying aerial shots to sweeping tracking shots seamlessly within one action scene. It creates a greater sense of immediacy and danger, expressing the gravity of the situation at hand.\r\n\r\nSome of the scenes are so distressing that I found my heart pounding throughout, and Ritchie\u2019s use of harsh close-ups adds to the intensity. There\u2019s a lot of cat-and-mouse content that adds to the tension, but it doesn\u2019t feel gimmicky because this is a film that is unafraid to kill off characters at any time (so don\u2019t get too attached to anyone).\r\n\r\nGyllenhaal and Salim make a dynamic onscreen duo, and both men have a natural chemistry that is the highlight of the film. Salim\u2019s performance is dynamic and genuine, and Gyllenhaal proves yet again that he\u2019s a formidable leading man. He\u2019s in his natural habitat here, playing a rugged everyman with a non-threatening masculinity that gives him a broad, universal appeal. The performances from the supporting cast are also top-notch.\r\n\r\nThe story is one of integrity, loyalty, and respect, and these men have an incredible amount of honor. Ahmed and Kinley are forced to make tough decisions, but they never shy away from doing the right thing, even when it\u2019s the harder option. These guys are still combat killers and trained soldiers, but their friendship takes center stage. This is such a great story of brotherhood that you\u2019ll wish it was true (sorry folks, this is a work of fiction).\r\n\r\nThe film only makes a couple of missteps, and there are two major things that bothered me. First, the alpha male dialogue among the soldiers is openly homophobic. It\u2019s laughed off and never challenged. I found this to be a bit problematic, but the way these guys talk is also likely accurate and authentic. Second, the grand finale shootout feels a bit like military propaganda, where the brawny American saviors must step in and become the heroes. It\u2019s a sequence that\u2019s thrilling, but feels stuffed in as a way to appease the hyper-patriotic \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201d crowd.\r\n\r\nBut here\u2019s where it gets interesting: the film is also highly critical of the U.S. government and the heads of the military. The soldiers may have honor, but those at a higher level do not. The film offers a scathing criticism that applies to the many ways the U.S. abandons its veterans too, from dismissing allegations of sexual assault, making it difficult to obtain proper healthcare, crafting vague promises, and flat-out lying. It\u2019s a profound theme that may be lost on the majority of audiences (but I hope not).\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Covenant\u201d is an extremely well made wartime action film, and those looking for a thrill will find it. Go and enjoy the entertainment value, but don\u2019t lose sight of the small, emotional story that\u2019s at the heart of it all.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / www.ScreenZealots.com**", "After Guy Ritchie\u2019s last film, Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, was an absolute disaster, I seriously considered skipping his most recent outing, The Covenant. However, I'm very happy I didn't because it's become one of my favorite films of the year so far.\r\n\r\nThe direction is excellent, with amazing up-close shots and zooms that really add to the intense nature of the film. The first hour flew by with fantastic build-up and character development. The action was superb and brutally realistic, showcasing the true horrors of the War in Afghanistan in a respectable way. However, after this first act, the movie does slow down a bit, with a pretty substantial lull that lasted about 20 minutes in the middle of the film. It was not terrible, but something I definitely noticed. Performances were excellent, particularly from Dar Salim, who was a standout in the film. His grueling journey across the Afghanistan terrain was one of the most stressful and inspiring segments in any film so far this year and had me at the edge of my seat.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Covenant is a pretty straightforward war story, told with excellent direction, performances, and visuals. It handles the source material with incredible care, showcasing the environment of Afghanistan in a way I have never seen before.\r\n\r\nScore: 85% \u2705\r\nVerdict: Great", "_Transformers: Rise of the Beasts_ is a pointless entry in the live-action _Transformers_ film franchise.

You'll hate yourself for watching it.", "Writing a review for a sequel like \u201cFast X\u201d feels pretty pointless. It\u2019s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I\u2019m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect \u201cFast X\u201d to be a film that\u2019s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It\u2019s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.\r\n\r\nThe plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, \u201cFast Five.\u201d If you don\u2019t remember the movie, don\u2019t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He\u2019s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his \u201cfamily\u201d are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.\r\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cfaith.\u201d The jokes aren\u2019t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier\u2018s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman\u2019s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in \u201cF9\u201d seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie \u2014 but there\u2019s also plenty to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there\u2019s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.\r\n\r\nThe film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom\u2019s son don\u2019t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).\r\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019m a fan of all things \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. \u201cFast X\u201d feels like it\u2019s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you\u2019re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it\u2019s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.", "I've more or less enjoyed the Fast and the Furious franchise though with each installment, the writers attempt to go further in its goofiness from the previous movie, it's becoming harder and harder to really be entertained, not to mention care one iota about these characters. I will say Jason Momoa, in whatever he was doing, was a hoot in the cold-blooded villain. And in typical \"Fast\" fashion, there are scenes that don't make a lick of sense. I found some of the action scenes to be well directed I guess by journeyman Louis Leterrier who took over from Justin Lin who left only a week into production.\r\n\r\nGiven I wasn't that big of a fan of Fate of the Furious or F9, I think I've grown out of this franchise and would be a good thing to bring it to a close. **2.5/5**", "<b>INT. GANGSTERS IN OKLAHOMA - DAY</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nFilm students, film lovers, cinema-goers, and reviewers rejoice! <i>Martin Scorsese's</i> latest film is excellent! <i>The Irishman</i> might have been his last 'gangster' film. Still, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> might not be a gangster film, but there are many 'mob' elements within it.\r\n\r\nThe biggest fear people had going into this film was the runtime. Weeks before the release, speculations came out about the length of this film. I saw an article stating it would be 4 hours long! Alas, it's only 206 minutes long, not even coming close to the longest film here at Cannes. I can confirm that the film never drags its feet for too long; there are times when it slows down, but this is only during the film's opening hour. Thankfully it quickly picks up the pace and goes by fast once the whole ensemble is introduced. <i>Jesse Plemons</i> is a late bloomer in the film, only being introduced 2 hours in; as I said, this is where the film starts moving.\r\n\r\nThe story is simple: During the 1920s, oil was discovered on Osage Nation Land. Turning them into the richest people per capita in the world! <b>Ernest Burkhart</b> (<i>Leonardo DiCaprio</i>) returns to work for his uncle, <b>William Hale</b> (<i>Robert De Niro</i>). Ernest meets <b>Mollie</b> (<i>Lily Gladstone</i>), and they marry. However, slowly many of Mollie's friends and family are murdered, with those who married into the family taking ownership of the land\u2014eventually, the FBI steps in to investigate.\r\n\r\nLily and Leo have excellent on-screen chemistry, with Lily performing phenomenally. I hear talks about the Oscars for her, which is entirely valid. De Niro steals many of the scenes he's in, often providing the most laughs. He is ultimately the most 'mob-like character within the film, never pulling the trigger but commanding the troops. Jesse Plemons is the final major character within the story as <b>Tom White</b>. Unfortunately, Plemon's isn't that interesting; I wonder if Plemons wasn't given much direction or if he decided to make the character this way. Still, White moves from scene to scene without much interest. He's just there, leading the FBI but never being an individual; I didn't remember his name after the film; I just referred to him as 'FBI guy.'\r\n\r\nTechnically, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is a marvel (Not that Scorsese would like me saying the word 'Marvel'), but just like all of his films, everything is great. Nothing stands out as 'excellent'; the score, editing and cinematography are at the level you'd expect from the mind of Scorsese.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to my final thoughts on the film; recently, Martin has been talking about his age and his ability to make films like he used to. Scorsese is 80 years old and doesn't believe he has the same drive as <i>Ridley Scott</i>. Suppose this is to be his final film. In that case, I'd be happy knowing it's not a significant departure from what made him the famed director but a story worth telling from a creator who will continue to be studied and praised for the next many decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FADE OUT.</b>", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review-a-work-of-art/\r\n\r\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon is a remarkable cinematic feat by the master Martin Scorsese, with exceptional contributions from Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, as well as a striking, breakthrough performance by Lily Gladstone.\r\n\r\nIt unveils a harrowing narrative that prompts deep, poignant reflection on the past and present. Technically, all departments shine, but Thelma Schoonmaker\u2019s editing is simply flawless.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast\u2019s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn\u2019t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn\u2019t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love.

After a long time, Marvel delivers a beautiful and wholesome experience. While everyone from the cast gets their due share of high moments but this film belongs to Rocket. The true MVP of the film. The High Evolutionary's character was unforgiving and brilliant in the context of the story. The screenplay never dissapoints and keeps you engaged even with its long runtime of 150mins.

The voice at the end of the call warns him that he is sitting atop a weight-controlled bomb and that his family are in great danger should he not do as he is told. Just to reiterate that threat, he is to rendezvous with his colleague \"Sylvain\" (Arian Moayed) who is soon no long a concern! To add to the poor man's woes, when he tries to contact his wife he discovers that she is off meeting a lawyer! Can he salvage anything from this perilous, meticulously planned, scenario before they are all chum? For a while, here, Nimr\u00f3d Antal sustains a degree of menace as the mystery unfolds, but sadly - once it does, it's pretty obvious whom the protagonist actually is and the proceeding car chases make the art of simple urban road-blocking by the German police look just a little amateurish! The last twenty minutes are especially disappointing with a denouement that's not short on pyrotechnics but is short on just about everything else. It's a very derivative television movie that if you enjoy the genre, you probably won't hate - the pace sees to that. You won't remember it for long afterwards, though.", "As someone who was a victim of child sexual abuse myself and as someone who admittedly likes Trump (who praised this movie to no end) and also as a tiny bit of conspiracy nut and seeing all the mainstream media attack this movie and trying to smear it, I really, REALLY wanted to like and support and even praise this movie - but I just can't.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that it's a bit difficult for me to agree with the mainstream media's warning about this movie, but they really are correct for once - sometimes they throw you curve balls like that. I mean after all, there was a time when I trusted the mainstream media and I lost trust in them not because they were mainstream, but because they just started to get a lot of things wrong. But that also means that if they get things right for once, I can't just categorically disagree with them.\r\n\r\nAnd it's really not like they are just smearing this movie for no good reason. They do (for the most part) have a valid point. This movie does nothing to actually stop this crime or to help the victims or to help people recognize this crime when they see it. On the contrary, because it claims to be based on true events, it causes people to have a completely wrong impression about this and therefore makes it harder for people to detect it when it's happening, because this movie is less accurate in its depiction of the real world than a Liam Neeson action thriller. Actually, Liam Neeson's recent film \"Memory\" was pretty good and actually much more accurate in it's depiction of child trafficking than this movie.\r\n\r\nBecause this movie really does nothing but reinforce outdated and completely wrong stereotypes. This type of thing isn't something that mainly happens in South America or in \"other\" countries and children don't just get kidnapped out of the blue by complete strangers and against their will. The sad truth is that most cases don't involve a stranger at all, but someone the child trusts and the child isn't gonna come running to you begging for help, cause the truth is they are victims of years of extremely systematic and sophisticated psychological manipulation.\r\n\r\nAnd the perpetrators aren't all tough guys either. Actually a lot of them are quite educated, sophisticated and female because they don't raise suspicion. And also it's not just about forcing the kids to make movies - that only plays a very, very small part, but this movie would have you believe that that's the main part - that's the smallest part by far! Most of the aspects involved are MUCH worse than \"just\" that. \r\n\r\nAnd as much as I would love to think that there are plenty of officers (official or rogue) of government security agencies who are incorruptible and ceaselessly fight the \"bad guys\" in relentless sting operations, the reality sadly isn't as clear cut. Yes, sometimes SOME children do get rescued, but actually very rarely by police, much less government security agencies.

The plot was incredibly generic, filled with a bunch of cool spy jargon that made the agents sound really cool. The pace is way too fast, with jump cuts from scene to scene that attempt to be quick and seamless but just left me lost. I spent more time trying to figure out what was going on, where we were, and why we were here than I did enjoying the actual movie. The action was average at best, filled with cuts that tried to mask the poor choreography. When we were not spending time on lackluster action set pieces, it was used to deliver exposition dumps to help the audience attempt to understand what was going on. I have a hard time coming up with anything positive about my experience with the film.\r\n\r\nThe performances left a lot to be desired. I think Jason Statham and Josh Hartnett did a decent job, but they did not blow me away. None of the main cast had any amount of chemistry, particularly Statham and Plaza. The latter quite disappointed me in this film. None of her comedic timing worked, and I found her performance to be rather flat. With how stacked the cast was, I am leaning toward believing that the script was so horrid that it was limiting the actors abilities to put on a good performance.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a pretty terrible time watching this in theaters. I kept checking the time, waiting for the credits to finally roll.

The writing was so bad. There were so many great qualities this movie had going for it.

Co-directed by Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears and co-written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg, this animated feature is confident, action packed, funny, and is a visual delight. It\u2019s a crowning achievement in animation, and the perfect summer movie to boot.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the origin story of four turtle brothers, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), who were mutated after a dangerous laboratory explosion left them covered in radioactive ooze. Their adopted father Splinter (Jackie Chan), a kind and elderly New York City sewer rat, has sheltered his teenage sons from the harsh, dangerous, and judgmental human world for over a decade. Deciding that they want to be accepted as normal teenagers, the brothers head out into the city on their own, crossing paths with young reporter April O\u2019Neil (Ayo Edebiri). A fast friendship develops, and the turtles find themselves taking on a mysterious crime syndicate that\u2019s run by fellow mutants.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a good story that\u2019s elevated by across-the-board talent. Spears and Rowe\u2019s crackerjack direction is on point, especially when it comes to orchestrating thrilling action scenes. This is easily one of the most well-directed animated features I\u2019ve ever seen. Energetic and bursting with enthusiasm, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to have a blast watching this movie.\r\n\r\nThe characters are great, too. The turtles may be mutants, but they still act like regular, dumb teenage boys, finding humor in the silliness of everyday experiences. The voice performances are outstanding too, with a talented cast and a diversity that feels natural and appropriate. Everyone (including Paul Rudd, Ice Cube, John Cena, Rose Byrne, and Giancarlo Esposito) gives top-tier turns, and it makes the movie even better.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this animated film isn\u2019t made for little kids, and youngsters will likely be very bored and fidgety. This is more of a movie that\u2019s geared towards \u2018tweens, teens, and their parents (especially dads over 35 who grew up with the Ninja Turtles in various iterations). I would think longtime fans would be enamored with what the film does to their classic heroes, because a person like me who had very limited knowledge of the characters was quickly won over.\r\n\r\nFilms like \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d are exciting because not only are they breathing exciting life into the animation genre, they are setting the highest standards for quality, edgy animated films for adults.

This might have been a bit better if they'd just cut all the preamble and gone straight to the rig and to the underwater action, big fish and pyrotechnics. As it is, we spend far too long meandering about on the surface meeting the characters and there's way too much pointless dialogue throughout - though one or two half-hearted witticisms and puns help a little - before an ending that is entirely predictable and really rather processionally so. The acting is just banal, the continuity is all over the place - as is the editing - and the huge chunk of Ali Baba money that's floated this thing ensures that the switches from the English to Chinese languages actually smacks more of keeping everybody happy in the boardroom rather than engaging anyone in the actual cinema. Simply, even the charismatic Statham cannot rescue this from the doldrums of CGI-led mediocrity that churns out an unremarkable hybrid of \"Jaws\" and \"Jurassic Park\". It does need a big screen.

There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it\u2019s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they\u2019re a great onscreen duo.\r\n\r\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn\u2019t one misstep to be found.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d is the type of film that proves animation isn\u2019t just for kids, and it\u2019s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It\u2019s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema.

It has the message, but it isn't screamed at you at the top of it's lungs like most movies are these days.  In fact, it's so subtle that it's not even much of a distraction.  \r\n\r\nNot that it doesn't have it's distractions.  It has the same \"because the plot needs it\" occurrences that make you roll your eyes that seem to plague just about every movie these days... but even that is sort of muted.\r\n\r\nThe themes are fun and decent enough where you would actually want your kids to see it... and in the end it doesn't try to do anything new, it just attempts to make itself into a fun and enjoyable film.  That's really all I ask for in movies, especially these days.  I want to have fun at the box office again, and this movie delivers that.\r\n\r\nIt's just... you forgot it was even released didn't you?\r\nAnd you hardly ever heard of the character.  There was next to no publicity.  It wasn't really advertised, it came at a time when people were burned out from all the political super hero movies, and let's face it, everyone is sick of the huge CGI fight with the huge CGI villain/army.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end you had a bit of a flop, and an undeserving one at that, because the movie is fun, it does entertain, and it deserved more than it got.", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-mi-dead-reckoning-part-one-is-a-summer-blockbuster-in-its-purest-form/\r\n\r\n\"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers precisely what it set out to do: stunningly frenetic, relentless on-location action with adrenaline-charged energy levels. A 163-minute runtime rarely feels this light, thanks to the contributions of the sublime cast \u2013 Hayley Atwell is outstanding \u2013 and the truly memorable score that elevates all the otherworldly set pieces.\r\n\r\nIt has the \"problem\" of being the first of two parts, with some unnatural, repetitive exposition scenes that get in the way of its progress, in addition to a somewhat generic, ambiguous narrative around A.I.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it's a summer blockbuster in its purest form, as you'd expect from the icon Tom Cruise, to whom we owe our allegiance.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "The Tom Cruise \u201cMission Impossible\u201d franchise is one of reliable quality and equally dependable \u201cforgettable-ness.\u201d I\u2019ve seen every film, yet my memory is fuzzy when I try to recall what happened in any of them. And while it\u2019s almost a given that \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d will somehow sadly meet a similar fate, it\u2019s still one of the best of the bunch. Not one thing disappointed me about this seventh installment in the series, an exciting and entertaining ride that gets almost everything right. This is an absolutely terrific action movie that overdelivers, and I loved every minute of it.\r\n\r\nWorld class field agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) works as a field agent for an elite, top-secret branch of the CIA called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). His team, including associates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) have become close friends, and they\u2019re a well-oiled machine when working together. They regroup to embark on a dangerous mission to track down a new weapon that threatens all of humanity. The entire world is at stake, and Ethan must find a device before it falls into the wrong hands while dealing with some dark skeletons of his own past.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the most enjoyment out of the film, it\u2019s best not to read too much about the plot. What works so well about the story is that it has a modern angle, and the motivations of the villains are extremely strong. The stakes are high and there\u2019s a very real danger, which adds to the overall excitement. As one character puts it, they\u2019re fighting \u201can enemy that\u2019s everywhere and nowhere.\u201d It\u2019s smart, sophisticated, and polished in a way that tends to evade your typical summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nThere are a few high tech, double cross, master of disguise elements, but they aren\u2019t used as a distracting gimmick (as they sometimes have been in previous MI films). The high-concept action scenes are energetic and absolutely thrilling, making for some very clever and inventive spectacles. From a dramatic footrace through the canals of Venice to motorcycle jumps in the Austrian Alps to an epic car chase through the streets of Rome, there\u2019s never a dull moment. There\u2019s an inspired, extended sequence on a runaway train that will go down in history as one of the most creative and fun action scenes of the year, if not ever.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of strong female characters in the story, including the new addition of Grace (Hayley Atwell), a crackerjack larcenist, and Paris (Pom Klementieff), a fierce bodyguard who gives off strong Harley Quinn vibes. This movie, simply put, is packed with badass women. Seeing the gang reunited is always fun, and Pegg and Rhames have created characters that feel like old friends. There\u2019s excellent work from the supporting cast too (Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, and Shea Whigham). Cruise is starting to show his age, but he\u2019s still one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest working superstars. His performance is reliable, charismatic, and believable, which is exactly what it needs to be.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clear that this is a movie that\u2019s older and wiser and in turn, it\u2019s made with more mature audiences in mind. Nothing is dumbed down, the emotional meter runs high, and the level of style and poise is unexpected and welcome (and to be commended). This is a classic espionage thriller that achieves a balance between artistry and pleasure, which is no easy feat.\r\n\r\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning\u201d is the first part of a two part saga, but the finale isn\u2019t so open-ended that it leads to frustration. Instead, it\u2019s more of an excitement-based cliffhanger that\u2019ll leave you salivating for the second half. This is a movie that could stand alone, but I\u2019m awfully glad it doesn\u2019t.", "It was a good movie. Not better than the pervious one. But loved it", "Good stuntwork as usual from this series and the performances were well done and nice seeing the return of Henry Czeny as Kittridge and filling in the gaps from the first movie and that deal made with Max. They did a decent enough job with a villain that was essentially A.I. by giving it a face with Esai Morales's Gabriel character, albeit compared with the others in the franchise, was pretty weak. And for Cruise, he's at home as Ethan Hunt while the rest of the team had their moments.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback is some of the dialogue, especially during the intelligence agencies meeting, felt stilted probably because it was basically exposition dump.\r\n\r\nIt's not on the level of the past few movies but still entertaining, just had hoped the splitting of two movies thing was over and done with or at least was made justifiable (like Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame), which I'm not sure it is here. **3.75/5**"], "meta": ["It's sure to be a bone of contention...\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by S. Craig Zahler, Bone Tomahawk stars Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins and Lili Simmons. Music is by Zahler and Jeff Herriott and cinematography by Benji Bakshi.\r\n\r\nAh, yes, the horror western hybrid, a most difficult thing to get right at the best of times, even harder to entice newcomers to the sub-genre splice if they don't particularly like horror or westerns! This is a tough sell, a pic of startling originality, but of homage worthiness as well, that it kind of feels like a film made for a secret society of film fans. A society perhaps like the Troglodyte tribe who dominate the horror aspect of this particular tale.\r\n\r\nPlot is set in the wild west, where after a set of circumstances leads to the kidnapping of three people from the local jail - by members of the Troglodyte tribe, four men set off on a rescue mission...\r\n\r\nHow splendid to find a narrative that isn't afraid to nod towards one of the most revered westerns of all time, yet be its own entity at the same time. Bone Tomahawk will polarise opinions, no question about it, the whole middle section involves a travelogue pumped by characterisations and a need to set the stage for what will occur in the final third. However, to even think that the four horsemen of the apocalypse bulk of this movie is mere slow time cinema is unfair, for dark comedy is at work - a racist horse? Surely not?. \r\n\r\nSo the screenplay not only sparkles with wit, but it also pulses with drama, drama that comes from human stubbornness. Be it men who know that no matter what will happen, they will maybe die in honour due to mistakes or mismanagement, or just a matter of redemption, this mission on the surface seems pure folly, but in reality there is more at work here. And thus comes the horror, characters have been well formed, we know them and are interested in what will happen to them. Like or dislike is irrelevant, we bloody know them, so as the film hits its raging \"B\" movie straps, shouting at the screen or wincing in harmony becomes a requisite. As is squirming...\r\n\r\nIntricately paced, beautifully photographed and splendidly performed by a top cast who aren't interested in top billing or walk of fame recognition, Bone Tomahawk is a grade \"A\" culter. Zahler could be someone to keep an eye on. 9/10", "**The flea, the flay and an offspring.**\r\n\r\nIt's shocking to find how much this film was underrated. Certainly it is not a fairytale like from the Disney production. That mean not for the children, but for the adults. Based on the collections of tales by some 17th century Italian poet. All the tales blended together so well, You won't even feel the familiarity with the original tale, because the modifications were at its best. So I appreciate the writer first, and then the director, followed by the actors.\r\n\r\nSince the film has a multiple story narrative layer, like three, the opening and the ending was common to all. But soon after the initiative, the tales go separate ways with its own twists and turns and conclusion, till again falling back in the line to finish it off the film. First a royal couple tend to do anything to have their own child. After many years, having no luck with the pregnancy, they now follow the instruction given by a necromancer. The result is most certain, but not without a negative effect.\r\n\r\nThe desperate couple sacrifices greater to have a child. The remaining story takes place in the few years later where a royal born child and his mother have differences. A fresh complication arises that puts the mother again in a tight spot. How it is going to be solved narrated in the following parts.\r\n\r\nIn the second story, the king of a hill castle is obsessed with his new insect pet. That leads him to neglect his own daughter who is dreaming of getting married and have a great life. But the things are not going well between father and daughter with her mother's absence. When the king comes to realise that, he comes with an agenda to achieve two things in one shot. That does not please his daughter, and soon she ends up in the hands of an ogre. The remaining is to tell us what happens to her in a thrilling way.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a father's responsibility. If his wife was alive, their daughter would have been taken care at best. Compared to the others, this tale gets more exciting and edgy, even the locations. Of course they have used blue/green screens, but still beautiful like the one from the top of the castle scene. I liked the casting for this, particularly the princess part.\r\n\r\n> \"The equilibrium of the world must be maintained.\"\r\n\r\nThe third tale is about a lustful king. One day when he hears a woman singing in a beautiful voice, the next minutes he lands on her home's front door, not knowing the woman is aged and has the wrinkle skin. But she and her sisters play along hiding behind the door and asks for a favour in order to win them back, I mean one of them. So how the rest of the story develops and who gets what, followed by a twist, it comes to an end.\r\n\r\nIt is a spectacular film. But not visually as the fairy tales told in the present Hollywood films. Particularly, it minimised the computer related special effects. So it was more realistic, yet you will get that fantasy feel with how the tales shape up. It's a black comedy, and that's an absolutely well done part. You know designing the dark humours are not an easy task and this film has three layers, though not all of them has them. The conclusions were so perfect, reminds us the happy and sad are the parts of our life.\r\n\r\nOver two hours long film, there's no drag in the narration. The length is because of the three tales and each one was narrated with a pretty good pace. But still it gives the impression the film is slow and that's for being silent like less background score in the most of the parts. From Salma Hayek to Toby Jones, Vincent Cassel, all were so good. The casting was the advantage for the film to shape up well. Since it is an international project, that will help the global audience to their comfort.\r\n\r\nThe director's first English language film and I think I'm going to keep an eye on his future projects. Certainly I have not seen such film like this, not in the todays cinema. The film was like in the old days. It does not deliver a couple of quick jokes and/or breathtaking visual effects, but the depth of the tale was good. The writers, director did not hesitate to add extra minutes to get what they wanted. I would have liked it if another layer of the tale was included and extended for another 30 or more minutes. For the grown ups, I suggest it not to miss, you won' get a film like this often.\r\n\r\n_8/10_", "This movie was terrible; obviously up-rated by interested parties - boring & suspenseful.", "Pointless and terrible film that leads to nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe Director of Fish Tank, was not able to capture lighting in a bottle twice.\r\n\r\nMost of the movie is spent in a van listening to rap music, the other large part is the boring romance story with a protagonist who seemed better to be a prostitute, then a door to door salesperson.\r\n\r\nOther characters are introduced but no depth is added to these characters, even though we spend a lot of time in a van with them.\r\n\r\nThe movie doesnt even pay off with the Conclusion it seemingly leads too, it just ends.", "Terrifier is a gory movie with a sadistic killer clown that revels in mutilating his victims in creative ways and willing to use any kind of improvised weapon as well as one not often seen in slasher movies. The movie makes effective use of practical effects and the gory murders are graphic enough to make you know this movie means business. David Howard Thornton stars as Art the Clown and his portrayal is devilishly effective as a villain who is mute and must use facial gestures to express himself in his ghoulish clown makeup. The story is the usual cat and mouse variety but this film is more about watching Art capture, torture and mutilate his victims. Terrifier is an effective and bloody slasher film that follows the usual formula of 1980's horror films and has crowned Art the Clown as one of the new faces of horror.", "_Terrifier_ had a lot of hype behind it with its very successful sequel hitting theaters this month, and unfortunately it did not translate to a pleasurable viewing experience. Before I jump into my criticisms of the film, the on-screen quality of visuals and effects were top notch for a budget of a mere $25,000. It is amazing what this crew was able to do with their conditions and everyone involved should be proud. With that being said, the limited budget does not give excuses for a poor script, dialogue and performances. This movie had a tremendous amount of cringe with perverted dialogue that seemed as if a middle schooler wrote it. The performances were campy, but not in a good way. In classic horror films the camp has a sense of nostalgia and a sign of the times but with this modern film with kills and elements that are taking themselves somewhat seriously, it just comes off as bad. The actor behind Art did do a fantastic job though. His portrayal of a mute killer who communicates to his victims with mimes and clown tricks was funny and chilling at the same time. The plot on its face did not have much depth to it. It boiled down to people in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was no added depth or lore to why these events were happening, although I did enjoy how each character who was tragically murdered had a connection the plot and were not just some random people introduced and killed in a single scene just to pad the kill count. As horror film, this movie failed to add any stakes or tension. The director leaned more into the gore which can be unsettling to look at but never made me feel uneasy. There was no build up to any of the kills, these classic horror elements made the movie seem extremely bland. Overall, I think this film is a marvel from a technical perspective based on its low budget, but when judging it from a film perspective it left me bored and waiting for the credits.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _33%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Bad_", "This film picks up where \"Chariots of Fire\" (1981) leaves off with the Olympic champion Eric Liddell (Joseph Fiennes) now a missionary in the land of his birth - now war-torn - China. When the Japanese invade, he is initially f\u00eated - well fed and looked after, but that is all part of the ultimate game of humiliation as he is basically being groomed for a race against \"Xu Niu\" (Shawn Dou). This is quite an interesting depiction of just how this man's Christian faith and sense of decency were pitched against the ruthlessness of his captors who used both physical and psychological methods to reduce their captives to jelly. Whilst this certainly hints at those atrocities, the whole look and feel of the film is just a little sterile and Fiennes isn't really up to much in the lead. Somehow his strength of faith and purpose is lost in a really mediocre production that never quite gets going properly. Based in fact, it does offer us a truth about the truly shameful ending for this man of principle, but perhaps a remake with a better cast, writing and more vision from a director who understands how to better deliver a story of a complex individual would leave us feeling better fulfilled. Watchable, but forgettable I am afraid.", "**It's not just about survival...**\r\n\r\nThe title says it all. Then I read its synopsis and right away I knew how much should I expect from it. Because this might be a fresh attempt in the Korean film, at least for the first time I'm seeing in a Korean film, but not from the world cinema. Yeah, I have seen plenty, and I'd liked most of them. But this film was much, much better than it had been rated in the internet. The story, the main event starts without wasting any time. There's no initial developments like intros. When the thriller-adventure parts commences, reveals everything you have to know.\r\n\r\nJust over 2 hours long, the story frequently switches back and forth to where a man got trapped in a collapsed tunnel road and the outside where people and rescue team gathered. Like any other similar themed film, it borrowed a handful of clich\u00e9s, but still you can witness the effort for the avoidance. Like if you see something or someone's crucial part come into play, usually you would predict what might happen to it in the later part of the story. Since those are unavoidable, they simply skipped in the final act as it is understandable and not to waste developing them to some extent.\r\n\r\nSo a man is fighting for his survival after a disaster strikes. But he got a cell phone signal buried under a deep mountain that I could not get. Anyway, he does make know his state of condition to the outside world. Soon they all rally to get him out. This film is not entirely a serious episode, despite the theme was. A little bit of satire. If that's how the film was intended or not, at least I had a couple of good laughs. Kind of reminded me 'Peepli (Live)', about the media circus in such situation. But that is the truth, what todays media have become, because of competition among themselves.\r\n\r\n> \u275dDon't be weak and say you'll die, just live.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe trapped man has to make sure about food and water to survive till the rescue team reaches him down which could take a week or more. Yeah, they kind of mention the recent Chile event which was made into the film, 'The 33'. His portion of the story is like the combination of '127 Hours', 'Buried' and of course that Chilean film. There are lots of things happen, you could say twists and turns. Kind of too much at some point, the way they added more contents to it, but decently it all worked out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the outside world, not lags behind. It has its own set of characters and its circumstance events. Lots of fun and also highlights wrongs. Particularly like I said, the media and how politicians make use of such incident for publicity. And the final one about the construction firms and their shoddy works for profits. They have dug on these topics, but did not go deeper, because to keep it lighter and entertaining film than all about awareness.\r\n\r\nAll the way an engaging narrative. Means a long film, but very swiftly told story. Visually, it was a well made film, like everything's looked natural and believable. You could not differentiate the CGI/green screen work and the real objects of those disaster parts. But not the technical details such as drilling or the hollow space where he stays alive. When the narration progresses, it gets even worse, like you would say how could that even possible or just they wanted it that way to end the tale.\r\n\r\nA small part of the end kind of skips, but that's good for the film than dragging it for another half an hour. The casting was good, they all performed well, but my favourite was Oh Dal-su. As usual, I loved his part, one of the finest supporting characters in the world cinema. It's not a great film, but good, and acceptable as what it is. In the end feels like worth it. So I decided to suggest it for those who are interested, but could not decide whether to go for it or not, and for the Korean film fans outside the Korea.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_", "**They're trying to bring back the series!**\r\n\r\nSo the Amityville series continues. What this is like overall a tenth film. The last one was a decade ago. I'm okay with their idea of bringing it up. But there's nothing new in it. Only it was a different cast and timeline. So basically, you probably have seen this story in other flicks.\r\n\r\nA family of a single mother with one child with a serious medical condition moves into the most popular haunted house, the Amityville. The other one, a teen girl discovers the rumours from her new schoolmates. But the mother won't heed to it, till unusual events begin to unfold. So how it all ends are the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nThe cast was good, and that's it, the film was average. If you are a big fan of horror, then this would be even a worse film, because you might have seen hundreds of similar flicks. I think Amityville franchise is dead, because of bad storied films. Otherwise with good filmmakers, particularly the writer, it could come back to the old glory. So now, it's not that worth. I would suggest to check it out other horrors released in this year.\r\n\r\n_5/10_", "Weak entry to an already played out franchise.

For reasons not worth recounting, Lee\u2019s wife Leslie (Erika Christensen) decides to accept Christ into her heart; the atheist Lee reacts to the news as if she\u2019d just confessed having a lover (indeed, at one point he even accuses her of \u201ccheating on him with Jesus\u201d).  \r\n\r\nFollowing his mentor's advice, Lee sets out to prove that the Resurrection never happened and thereby discredit Christianity. The rest of the film is an illustration that for those who believe in God, no explanation is necessary, and for those who do not believe, no explanation is possible. I would add that for those watching The Case for Christ, no explanation is provided. \r\n\r\nIn essence, the titular case for Christ is made up of a mixture of ipse dixit, proof by assertion, ad hoc hypothesis, and cherry picking.

The movie treats Samson as if he was an Israelite version of Hercules (which he may have very well been); sadly, the only Hercules director Bruce Macdonald seems to knows of is Kevin Sorbo's in The Legendary Journeys \u2014 to the point of giving him his own Iolaus (though Iolaus at least had an equivalent in Greek mythology).\r\n\r\nThe year is \"1170 BC\" in \"ancient Israel\". I think the date alone would be enough to clue us in that we\u2019re not in 'modern' Israel; on the other hand, considering that the establishing shot of \u201cIsrael\u201d is a computer-generated image, perhaps the clarification is not as useless as it seems.\r\n\r\nWe meet Samson (Taylor James) and his heretofore unheard of younger brother Caleb (Greg Kriek) stealing corn; caught in the act, they both flee from Philistine soldiers who, for some reason, stop chasing them once Samson and Caleb pass through the city gates \u2014 unfortunately, the film fails to have a Philistine soldier tell another: \u201cForget it, Jacob. It's Chinatown\" (not as far-fetched as you may think; later there will be a direct reference to the Avengers\u2019 Hulk).\r\n\r\n\u201cWhispers of a Hebrew with great strength\u201d reach the ears of the Philistine prince Rallah (Jackson Rathbone); he doesn't take them too seriously, but his father, King Balek (Billy Zane), orders him to investigate further, something Rallah does with no little reluctance (to paraphrase Iznogoud, Rallah wants to be King in place of the King). Rallah, listen to your friend Billy Zane, he\u2019s a cool dude.\r\n\r\nRallah recruits a Philistine giant (who calls the God of the Hebrews a \u201cpuny god\u201d) to defeat Samson; Samson gets his ass handed to him at first, but when the Lord fills him with His spirit, Samson hulks up (that\u2019s a reference to the other Hulk, mind you) and soon has the giant saying 'no m\u00e1s, no m\u00e1s'. \r\n\r\nFrom here on out the plot sticks more or less faithfully to the biblical account, with a small but peculiar departure wherein Samson has to be tricked into visiting a brothel; the Book of Judges says begs to differ, though: \"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, Samson is anointed Judge and travels to the Philistine capital to negotiate peace with Balek; his conditions are \u201creduce the tribute, return the harvest that is rightfully ours [or else] you will face the wrath of God.\u201d \r\n\r\nIn the film\u2019s best line, Zane replies, with all the considerable sarcasm he can muster, \"So you threaten me with natural phenomena, freakish acts, and the weather.\" Ha! In your face Samson! It almost makes me forget that Balek and Rallah are just as imaginary as Caleb-Iolaus \u2014 not that Samson or Delilah are historical figures, but almost; their story is so well known that you don't have to know your Bible to realize that this Samson is as much a caricature as the Simpsons' version of David and Goliath.", "This film knocked my socks off, since it was exactly the kind of hard science-fiction that I often read as a young man. In it, we are transported to a future time when space travel is commonplace; in this movie we see a man and his daughter who are hard-scrabble people trying to get by in life, but not wealthy. They are prospectors, and hope to strike it rich on a planet where breathing the air is deadly, so the atmosphere has to be filtered & atmosphere suits must be worn when outside.\r\n\r\nThe planet is spectacularly real. The airborne spores can be seen, and we are shown their deadly effect; most of the action takes place while wearing the suits which filter out those deadly spores. This film impressed me mostly for its realism; the suits were well-worn, the spacecraft were also, and much of their equipment had to be jury-rigged to be useful. \r\n\r\nThe actors did a great job; Cee (Sopie Thatcher) was a natural, and totally believable, and had good chemistry with Ezra (Pedro Pascal) who really carried the movie; he sometimes reminded me of Nathan Fillian in Firefly. I would've preferred a bit more background on their characters, and a few times I was unimpressed by their emotional reaction to certain events, but those are minor quibbles about an excellent film, which I urge all lovers of hard science-fiction to enjoy, as I certainly did!\r\n\r\nAs there are so very few real sci-fi movies to compare it with, I give this film 5/5; it's excellent!", "This film is an excellent example of a low budget, realistic, drama Sci-Fi. It's not an action Sci-Fi so don't expect it to be one. It is a drama, style is somewhat reminiscent of some of the old classics where technology is still quite basic and mechanical. It is not a western but it is analogous to the pioneering days of young western cultures like USA or Australia when times were tough and prospecting could send you back to the heart of the empire either filthy rich or in a coffin.

The most significant balloon flight depicted here is based on the September 5, 1862 flight of British balloonists James Glaisher and Henry Coxwell. \r\n\r\nHowever, while Glaisher appears in the film (played by Eddie Redmayne, who looks like he landed on his face after his own parachute failed to open), Coxwell has been replaced by Amelia (Felicity Jones), a purely fictional character.\r\n\r\nThe lesson seems to be that it's not enough to discredit a real person simply because they belong to the male persuasion, but on top of that they have to 'empower' a unnecessary character that the filmmakers have dreamed up because they can't be bothered to research the subject their film is supposed to be about \u2014 if they had, they would know that the history of aeronautics is not short on women; for example, Katharina Paulus, who invented the first collapsible parachute (and didn\u2019t endangered a dog\u2019s life in the process, I\u2019m sure).", "Well, I like Jones and I like Redmayne so I had high hopes for this, plus it was based on true events... and I understood that it was going to be exaggerated for dramatic effect, but I didn't think it was going to be a total rewrite of history.\r\n\r\nI don't mind taking artistic licenses when making movies based on historical events... but I had no idea that Henry Coxwell was a woman named Amelia Rennes and I didn't know that she was the only one capable of doing anything of value on the flight.\r\n\r\nBut, I guess politics got in the way of history, and they decided that a total rewrite to the point where it was based around a fictional character needed to be done because the truth had too much meh patriarchy? Because they couldn't depict men as being intelligent or daring in any way?\r\n\r\nThey went woke, and filled it with trope of the new woke fad.\r\n\r\nSo, Jones doesn't really struggle, she never makes a mistake, she is always more intelligent, stronger, and braver than anyone else around her, while everyone else around her is a bumbling fool that only succeeds because of her capabilities.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, her character is entirely fictional.\r\n\r\nBut, it's a success if you want to entirely rewrite history to suit a political agenda.", "Honestly as much as there were some cringy moments, mainly bad dubbing, and poor acting from the likes of Schwarzenegger and to an extent Chan, I can't say I was bored mainly for how bizarre the movie was at times.

What on Earth are they doing in this dross? Indeed, though to a lesser extent, could that question be posed at rent-a-stars Charles Dance and Rutger Hauer. The story, not that it remotely matters, centres around Flemyng's \"Jonathan Green\" - a map maker charged with charting the Russian Far East.

It's trying, to be fair. It mixes the mystic with the scientific; it even has a go at being witty now and again, but the sum of the parts is nowhere near good enough at the end. It lumbers along for almost two hours with a largely pedestrian dialogue and a sort of portmanteau style of delivery that smacks of a student assemble-edit.

As such, their whirlwind romance didn't resonate and the surfeit of coincidences left me expecting an imminent lottery jackpot.

Not even close. Matter of fact, it might be the exact opposite. The only films which I find hard to write a review on are those who don\u2019t have a single aspect that is either outstanding or horrible. Those who are so \u201cin the middle\u201d that you forget about them less than 24h after you\u2019ve seen it. 47 Meters Down: Uncaged could very well be this type of flick, but its ludicrous logical issues story-wise are impossible to ignore. Even the title is just a marketing scheme to attract people who liked the 2017\u2019s original since it is entirely unrelated to it (the water depth at which the characters are is never addressed).\r\n\r\nThis is one of the worst movies of the year. It still doesn\u2019t beat Serenity, but it made me rethink about the latter\u2019s grade because I find it so incredibly difficult to acknowledge one single good thing about this terrible sequel. Had I scored Matthew McConaughey\u2019s film an F, this one would probably belong there as well. However, in the same way that a film without flaws isn\u2019t necessarily an A+, a movie with no redeeming quality isn\u2019t instantly an F. If there\u2019s one compliment I can give Uncaged is that there are two or three short sequences where a jump scare is effective, or the suspenseful vibe was accomplished \u2026 Nevertheless, these are still just a couple of minutes in an almost 90-min runtime.\r\n\r\nThe characters have no development whatsoever. The story follows the most pathetic path possible. The sharks (which are the reason people actually went to the theater) are not as visually realistic as in the original, reaching a point where the CGI was pretty awful.

Audiences all over the world fill theaters and enjoy these series for what they are: popcorn entertainment. No one goes for the complex plots or layered characters. People go for the action, the explosions, the epic scores, the visual effects, and all of that stuff. Uncaged doesn\u2019t have any of that to compensate its other problems. One or two scenes here and there aren\u2019t enough to warrant the price of admission. Even the acting is mediocre. \r\n\r\nAll in all, 47 Meters Down: Uncaged is nothing more than a silly attempt at the start of a new franchise. Don\u2019t be fooled by its title since it has nothing to do with the original flick. It doesn\u2019t try to introduce compelling characters, the shark sequences fall flat for the most part, and the screenplay is filled with laughable plot points. There\u2019s no sense of logic. For an 89-minute runtime, it astounds me how it can\u2019t be slightly entertaining, to say the least. Undoubtedly, one of the worst films of the year.

It probably has some deeper meaning that I missed but definitely not my kind of movie.", "When I was in San Francisco, the first place I went and the first thing I did was go to City Lights and buy a copy of \"Howl.\"\r\n\r\nBack then, when City Lights published it, it was the liberals fighting against censorship and the \"Nazis\" fighting to censor things on moral grounds.\r\n\r\nNow, in 2020, the very concept of Free Speech is considered \"Nazi\" and the left is fighting to censor as much as they can on moral grounds.\r\n\r\nBut then, back when \"Howl\" was published it was the left fighting against segregation and the concept that races have to be separated, the idea that excluding a race because of the color of their skin was repugnant and racist and evil.\r\n\r\nAnd now the left is doing it and accusing anyone that disagrees with it of racism.\r\n\r\n\"No Safe Spaces\" argues that censorship is still wrong, that free speech is still a necessity for the freedom of the nation, for ending things like racism and segregation, and takes the bold step that suggests that Black people and White people should freely mingle and exchange ideas, live together in harmony.\r\n\r\nAnd the left is saying that all of this is wrong. That it is somehow racist and evil. That, just because the tables have turned and it's now the Republicans that are defending Free Speech and arguing against segregation, that makes it wrong.\r\n\r\nWe live in a crazy insane world full of people shrieking and attacking others to demand censorship and segregation... and this shines a spotlight on it.", "I went into this blind, but as soon as it was over, I instantly knew I witnessed something special.\r\n\r\nThis is gonna be hard to talk about since the movie doesn\u2019t follow a conventional narrative. Although I believe that these type of movies will stay with you much longer, as the emotional connection you had will be remembered for years. In other words, I will try my best to keep myself collective through out.\r\n\r\n\u2018Waves\u2019 is an absolute gut punch of a movie. Incredibly unique with its film making and overall presentation.\r\n\r\nFrom \u2018It Comes At Night\u2019 to \u2018Waves\u2019, Trey Edward Shults is a director to look out for. I still haven\u2019t seen \u2018Krisha\u2019 yet. The way he crafts stories and the close examination of these characters feels so close to life. It hit me on a emotional level. I love how the aspect ratio changes whenever the mood changes in terms of tone. There\u2019s some impressive and effective use of camera work through out, but the scenes that stood out for me was every time someone drives, the camera will spin clockwise at the front - which reminded me of \u2018It Follows\u2019 clockwork-like spin. There was also some free flowing camera work that also reminded me of Terrence Malick movies.\r\n\r\nThe performances and characters were all fantastic. Sterling K. Brown delivers a fantastic performance as a strict and yet flawed father who\u2019s method of parenting is incredibly demanding. He has a son and a daughter, but in the first half we only see him hang around with his son and sculpt him to be the very best, while not realizing his putting the weight of the world on his sons shoulders. We barely see him with his daughter and when we do there\u2019s a sense of regret on his face, as if the painful realization is killing him.\r\n\r\nNewcomer Taylor Russell truly shines as the heart of the family, which you later find out was from her perspective this entire time. Alexa Demie, Kelin Harrison Jr., and Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry are all terrific, but most effectively was the characters portrayal that was both dynamic and soul crushing. Lucas Hedges is perfectly cast as a sweet young man with one of the kindest smile you could\u2019ve imagined; warm and welcoming.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of music from Frank Ocean and Radiohead, but it's something that the characters would listen to rather than the directors own playlist. It actually sets the tone throughout. While at times it can get a bit too much music, but that didn\u2019t ruin the overall experience. I don\u2019t know why, but this entire movie reminded me of \u2018Moonlight\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe best complement I can give to this movie is how unpredictable it is, because I had no idea where it was going. Putting aside that I went into this knowing nothing, but that wasn\u2019t the reason. It's a long movie, but I was invested the whole time. What took me by surprise is how the movie is structured and how every act unfolds a new chapter. The first act was a rush of energy in terms of pace, but the second act is almost a different movie and feels almost mystical. And every action the characters make will lead a massive impact to other peoples lives...\r\n\r\nBecause when pain and tension rises, expect it to come crashing down and shatter you into million pieces.\r\n\r\n\u2018Waves\u2019 is great, but really underrated.", "'Waves', while certainly ambitious, is so busy trying to be a future indie classic with its camera acrobatics and needle drops that it forgets to give any impetus to care about the supposedly profound stories it's trying to tell, instead coasting on its stylistic flairs and hoping these will distract from how shallow its writing is, making the 135-minute run time incredibly laborious. By his own admission, Shults modelled his film on the two-part structure of Frank Ocean's 'Blonde', an album which is featured prominently in the film. What audiences get instead is the cinematic equivalent of putting the album on while having a cry in the shower, a deep dive into misery porn, yet 'Waves' is a far less rewarding experience than just doing the real thing yourself.\r\n- Ashley Teresa\r\n\r\nRead Ashley's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-waves-high-school-misery-porn-drowned-by-its-aesthetic", "\u2018The Dead Don\u2019t Die\u2019 is a luxuriously paced, wittily gory zombie comedy.

No, I'm not going to ease you in. I literally spent ninety minutes of my weekend feeling frustrated, angry, stressed out, and genuinely annoyed at how many aspects Force of Nature is horrible at. This is an atrocious film in every imaginable way. There's no redeeming quality or a little tiny positive note. I'm going to be as straightforward as I can. I'm not going to waste the usual time I need to write a review, this one will be written in less than fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the narrative. This movie is about a group of thieves that attempt to steal something from a building during a storm. It's a Category 5 hurricane, and all the film shows is rain. There are no windows breaking, doors flying, or any sort of indication that the weather is dangerous in any way. Every single character is plainly stupid. There's no way of describing them more accurately. Everyone makes astonishingly dumb decisions, based on the most illogical and unrealistic scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe action lacks everything it must have: energy, choreography, good editing, and everything else you can think of. A character dies, the camera goes in for a close-up, and the eyes are still freaking moving. That's the level of amateurism Force of Nature displays. The sound design comes from the past century, with punches, kicks, and gunshots sounding like I'm watching an anime. The editing is terrible throughout, but it's far from grabbing the spotlight with so many baffling stuff.\r\n\r\nEven the cast delivers laughable performances. Emile Hirsch (Cardillo) has the worst emotional range I've ever seen in an actor. His expressions are cringe-worthy in almost every single situation, independently of how serious the latter is or not. I have no idea what Mel Gibson (Ray) is doing in such a wretched flick. The \"plot armor\" that protagonists regularly possess is taken to a whole new level. Usually, they survive a 99%-chance of dying scenario, and the audience simply accept it. But the \"bad guys\" in this movie are ridiculously portrayed, almost like the actors are interpreting caricatures of their characters.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole film, I felt continuously frustrated. Every single minute is packed with story inconsistencies and truly irritating characters. I've never felt so uncomfortable watching a movie before. I never wished so hard for a film to finally end. I was moving around on my couch and giving these nervous chuckles because I was honestly feeling extremely annoyed at what I was watching. Michael Polish and Cory Miller should be ashamed of what they did. This is an embarrassment for any filmmaker. Believe me: I could easily write 2000+ words about this piece...\r\n\r\nForce of Nature is indeed a force to be reckoned with... for the \"Worst Movies I've Ever Seen\" contest. From the baffling character decisions to the illogically absurd narrative, Michael Polish directs an appalling film packed with excruciatingly embarrassing acting, horribly dated sound design, a nonsensical attempt at creating a catastrophic atmosphere, awful editing, impressively lousy action, and last but not least, one of the worst screenplays ever put to screen, by Cory Miller. The level of amateurism is genuinely jaw-dropping. I've never felt so uncomfortable watching a heist movie. I'm feeling incredibly frustrated, bitter, annoyed, and unsure how a film like this was made possible. Please, stay away from this abomination. Even if you're interested in watching it just to know how bad it actually is, be careful. Because you're not going to feel that well after watching Mel Gibson fall to this level.\r\n\r\nRating: F", "From Mel Gibson's worst fake smokers cough I have ever heard to every line delivered by Emile Hirsch making me cringe, this is one of the worst action/crime films I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through.

It is here, teamed up with \"Jess\" (Stephanie Cayo) that they become embroiled in a heist, in the midst of an hurricane, that sees them held hostage by some ruthless robbers in search of a room full of art in an ordinary residential block. Luckily, though, retired officer \"Ray\" (Mel Gibson) is on hand to help them survive. What Gibson is doing in this is anyone's guess. It is a poorly paced, shockingly derivative affair that has all the hallmarks of a college project, just with a bit more cash.

I enjoyed it like any other kid who enjoys almost everything, but it was never a show that made me nervously excited during the day, waiting for it to come on TV. I vividly remember getting pumped, knowing that a new episode of Dragon Ball Z or Timon & Pumba would broadcast on that particular day. I never felt that way with Scooby-Doo, and honestly, I don't know why. I was always curious about sci-fi and \"what lies beyond\", so maybe the fact that the goal of the show was to justify every single paranormal activity with some \"guy in a mask\" didn't really appeal to the kid in me...\r\n\r\nEither way, I still liked the series, and my memory is filled with all of the show's classic signatures: the (double or even triple) un-masking of the villains, Scooby jumping to Shaggy's arms because they both got scared, the ridiculously large sandwiches, you name it. Ironically, the biggest compliment I can give the film also relates to its major flaw. For any fan of the show, these classic moments will provide high levels of nostalgia and entertainment, so anyone who comes looking for that will definitely get what they desire.\r\n\r\nHowever, even though Scoob! is far from feeling like a corporate flick packed with product placement (looking at you, Sonic the Hedgehog), I can't help but feel that the studio was embarrassed by its own property. They try so hard to make this movie belong to 2020 that they completely forgot about what makes the show special for so many people. From the weirdly confusing song selection to the way too modern plot points, Scoob! 's narrative distinctly follows an Avengers-style plot (including an obvious allusion to Captain America holding his shield) focusing strongly on the superhero theme.\r\n\r\nThey didn't believe that Mystery Inc. and the (successful) formulaic story were enough to hold the target audience's attention, so they decided to borrow from one of the most entertaining and financially impactful genres of today, losing the essence of their own IP. Therefore, despite Scoob! having almost all of the cartoon's classic scenes, it still feels detached from the source material. In addition to this, if you're not a fan of Scooby-Doo and if you don't know anything about it, then don't expect this film to explain anything to you.\r\n\r\nFred, Velma, and Daphne get separated from Shaggy and Scooby early on (due to a hilariously dumb scene that only kids will accept), so almost no character development occurs within the first group of people. This movie focuses more on the pair's adventure and their relationship dynamics (which are explored in a cliche yet efficient manner), leaving 3/5 of the Mystery Inc. feeling left off. Actually, now that I think about it, Scoob! doesn't even have a mystery to solve!\r\n\r\nIn the cartoons, every episode is about discovering what or who's causing a specific paranormal event. This film basically follows that formula for the first fifteen minutes (which serve as an origin story of the gang) and then takes an entirely different path story-wise. I'm not going to complain about the plot's absurdity because it's undeniably a kids' movie, but these forced attempts to adapt Scooby-Doo to 2020 are what ruin the whole thing for me. The voice acting is great, though, and hearing Frank Welker interpret Scooby again is incredibly joyful.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Scoob! possesses almost all of the classic moments from the original cartoon, which will surely leave fans of the series satisfied and feeling that heartwarming nostalgia. In addition to this, the voice work is really good for the most part, especially from the legend, Frank Welker as Scooby. However, the studio hurts the film with countless attempts to adapt the formulaic yet successful screenplay that the show employed for decades into 2020. From the superhero-like plot to the lack of a central mystery, Tony Cervone finds himself in a writing mess (four screenwriters and three \"story by\" credits) from a company ashamed of its own product. If you're a hardcore fan of the animated show, this movie might leave you satisfied. But if you don't share a special connection with these characters and their classic adventures, or if you don't know anything about this franchise at all, Scoob! not only doesn't care to introduce or develop its characters, but it definitely isn't going to convert you.\r\n\r\nRating: C-", "Never my favourites of cartoon characters, this sadly doesn't really do much better than the pretty far-fetched, slapstick, animation series from the 1970s. It starts off by way of an explanation as to how the young \"Shaggy\" and his eponymous canine pal initially hooked up, before jumping forwards to present day where the two, along with the rest of the \"Mystery Inc.\" gang, must work together to thwart an evil plan to unleash the legendary guardian of the Underworld - a spectral form of Cerberus - on mankind. To be fair, it doesn't hang around and the animation quality keeps the style fairly similar to the original television series; it's just that the writing is really lacklustre and cheesy with the characters - for me, at any rate - just downright irritating, playing to just about every stereotype imaginable. The reveals at the end were always pretty silly, and here is no different - it's all just too lightweight and disappointing. I'd have backed Cerberus any day. Perhaps it is just aiming for a nostalgic audience of adults who recall it more fondly than I do? In any case, I really cannot see this resonating with the kids today and maybe this is one cinema release that lockdown did us all favour by restricting.", "The Secret: Dare to Dream is based on a self-help book, which is turn based on a pseudocumentary. I have not read the book (nor will I ever), but judging from the movie, it must be a lot like Brian Griffin's Wish It, Want It, Do It \u2013 complete with the 50 blank pages.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the movie does is instruct me that there are two ways I can live my life; one is as if everything were a miracle, and the other as if nothing were. But if everything is a miracle, then nothing is a miracle; the very concept of 'miracle' would not exist. Let's put it this way: if everything were a miracle, then many of the things that Jesus does in the Bible would no longer be special.\r\n\r\nThe only gospel, however, that TS:DtD preaches is the New Age Gospel. God's name is invoked only once (when Einstein is misquoted as saying that \"Coincidence is God's way of staying anonymous\"). The film revolves around the Law of Attraction, a pseudoscientific belief that positive or negative thoughts bring positive or negative experiences into a person's life.\r\n\r\nThe most curious thing about all this is that the movie stars Katie Holmes; this doesn't mean that she believes this nonsense, although it's no secret that she's not very picky when it comes to choosing belief systems; either way, I sincerely hope this is not what she left Scientology for.\r\n\r\nAccording to IMDb, \"Miranda (Katie Holmes) [is] a young widow trying to make ends meet while raising her three children and dating her boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell). A devastating storm brings an enormous challenge and a mysterious man, Bray (Josh Lucas), into Miranda's life. Bray reignites the family's spirit but, unbeknownst to Miranda, also holds an important secret - one that will change everything. With its timeless messages of hope, compassion, and gratitude, The Secret: Dare to Dream is an inspiring and heartwarming film that shows how positive thoughts can transform our lives.\"\r\n\r\nThe message is that if we think very hard we can all have a huge house, a pony, and a Mac computer. Of course there are caveats; sometimes you think of Matthew McConaughey and the best the Universe can come up with is Josh Lucas. And what about Tuck (O'Connell), Miranda's boyfriend \u2013 briefly fianc\u00e9 \u2013 whose engagement ring she returns, breaking his heart? Weren't his thoughts positive enough? Or maybe he just looks too much like Tom Cruise for her taste.", "Disappointment that it didn't live up to the first film.\r\nAt least first film was edgy, a little scary, even had goths.", "Sigh... not that I expected anything that equaled the original The Craft even partially, this is an insult to decades of pre-woke era American culture.\r\n\r\nSensitivity and tolerance notwithstanding, this is thematically and aesthetically a major step down from the original film and urinates all over the legacy of that classic contribution to American cinema.\r\n\r\nMost glaring from a visual standpoint is casting of the 4 leads, a double wide boy posing as a girl(!?), a girl who looks like a boy, a legitimately ugly girl, and (at least) a beautiful descendant of the kings and queens of Africa.

A sort of elongated episode of \"Buffy\", written by someone who has little, if any, grasp of how to construct a suspenseful story and directed with the same level of skill. It reminded me of female equivalent of \"The Covenant\" (2006) and what David Duchovny is doing here is anyone's guess. In my view, it's well out of it's depth getting a cinema release at all - it's a pretty pointless exercise on just about every count that belongs on daytime teen television.", "The Cronenberg name is tightly associated with the body horror genre, and rightfully so. 'Possessor' feels like a fever dream, delivering unsettling violence, thought-provoking creativity and remorseless direction.

Boasting two phenomenal performances from Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott (Colin Tate), Possessor is one of the most visually shocking films of 2020.\r\n\r\nFrom the extreme gore to the unrestrained depiction of insanely violent murders, Cronenberg fills his movie with creepy imagery that will definitely trigger many viewers to simply give up. Its slow pace helps establish the never-ending suspenseful atmosphere, which ultimately delivers some of the most intense sequences I've seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nDespite the interesting narrative and its eye-opening developments, Possessor fails to keep the momentum going throughout the entire runtime. The weird imagery helps with visual storytelling, but it reaches a point where it becomes too distracting and unnecessary. The third act is also quite predictable, contrasting with the somewhat surprising first half.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's still one of my favorite horror films of the year.\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "One of the MOST boring attempts at making a Western by a Top shelf actor to date..

Blake Lively injured herself on set, consequently delaying the movie until the end of 2019, and then again to the well-known \"trash month\", so obviously, my expectations were quite low. It's the first time I watch a feature film directed by Reed Morano, as well as Mark Burnell, who makes his debut as a screenwriter. As usual, the only thing I knew about the movie was its synopsis and crew, but I also caught the overwhelmingly negative feedback from critics and audiences alike...\r\n\r\nWhile its flaws are undeniable (and I'll get there), I don't find Reed Morano's film to be worthy of belonging in January with so many worse movies. Sean Bobbitt's cinematography is a technical standout, by delivering two fantastic one-take action sequences (one of which is edited to feel like one take), and some wide shots look genuinely stunning. I always love when a film is set in actual cities or remote locations since these offer a realistic atmosphere, and given the right treatment in post-production, the tone can be better controlled by the environment surrounding the characters.\r\n\r\nThe cast is also really good. Blake Lively delivers one of the best performances of her career, definitely the most somber one. Her character is constantly placed in challenging situations, physically and emotionally. Blake incorporates Stephanie's state of mind seamlessly, carrying the narrative forward even when the latter fails to captivate the viewer. Jude Law is Jude Law, and Sterling K. Brown offers a notable display as well. However, the positives end here.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, The Rhythm Section lacks creativity and uniqueness. Besides being way too straightforward and predictable for an action-drama with a central mystery, it's edited (Joan Sobel) in such an uncommon manner that makes the movie feel incredibly tiresome. Tons of moments are drawn out for extra seconds or even minutes. Almost every scene weirdly goes on for far too long. There's no new information to transmit to the viewer, nothing is happening... The whole film is edited like this, consequently ending with almost fifteen/twenty minutes of nothing. Also, some dialogue scenes are intercut with something that's going to happen after that particular conversation, which is confusing in the sense that the viewer doesn't know where the focus is supposed to be on.\r\n\r\nThen, the actual narrative raises tons of logical questions. I hate to be \"that guy\" who nitpicks character decisions or plot points like CinemaSins (even though this channel makes so for comedy purposes), but this movie really makes the viewer wonder \"how/why the hell is she able to do this?!\" Stephanie is trained to be an agent, and while a specific part of her training is straight-up impossible, I believe that the character possesses the required skills. My issue is that she barely uses anything that she learned: she continuously runs away from everyone and everything and she gets other innocent people dead in her partially failed missions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her, there are other characters with either unclear motivations or questionable lifestyles, having in mind that this film deals with secret intelligence, terrorism, and stuff that very few people have access to or knowledge of. The score also feels extremely awkward. Similar to the editing issue, the song selection doesn't fit the dark, depressing tone that the movie carries. Sometimes, Stephanie is about to go on a serious mission, and upbeat pop music is playing... Why?\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Rhythm Section isn't as awful as most January films, it certainly doesn't deserve the record of the worst opening weekend of all-time, but it still carries tons of issues. The editing (Joan Sobel) is weirdly unconventional, drawing out scenes for extra seconds or even minutes where absolutely nothing happens and intercutting dialogue sequences with unnecessary flashbacks or flashforwards. Reed Morano isn't able to bring creativity or anything remotely original to her movie, and Mark Burnell writes a predictable screenplay packed with questionable plot points and logical issues, not helping the already dull pacing. Steve Mazzaro's score doesn't fit the tone of the film, but Sean Bobbitt's cinematography delivers a couple of surprising action sequences and some neat wide shots. The cast is really good, and if not for an outstanding Blake Lively, this movie would have been a lot worse.\r\n\r\nRating: C-", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAneesh Chaganty's Searching was enough to add its debutant director-screenwriter to my list of \"filmmakers to follow closely\". Run solidifies Chaganty's place in Hollywood as one of the most technically impressive directors working today. His undeniable talent allows him to effortlessly generate incredible suspense throughout the movie's entire runtime, and his second feature-film is no exception.\r\n\r\nPossessing the type of premise I enjoy the most in thrillers, Chaganty and Sev Ohanian's screenplay is packed with excruciatingly long takes, filled with extremely tense dialogues, shocking developments, and a brutal amount of pain. All are enormously elevated by one of the most physically-demanding, emotionally powerful performances I've seen in the last few years: Kiera Allen, who uses a wheelchair for mobility in real-life, turns her acting debut into a genuine, realistic display of the challenging obstacles people with her condition have to overcome daily.\r\n\r\nSarah Paulson continues her trend of playing truly evil characters, and I advise her to keep following this dark path of phenomenal interpretations. Her interactions with Kiera are remarkably intense. Story-wise, even though the constant revelations are narratively shocking, most of the script's developments are somewhat predictable. However, the \"movie logic\" problems stretch believability to a point beyond my limit, ultimately becoming one of those films people will either deeply enjoy or really hate depending on how nitpicky they choose to be.\r\n\r\nI'm as moderate as I can be, and the truth is, I didn't really think about these logical issues during the actual viewing. Having in mind Run's brilliant technical attributes (notably Nick Johnson and Will Merrick's editing, and Torin Borrowdale's score), its two impressive lead performances, and its endless suspenseful atmosphere, I can't help but recommend it to every fan of the genre.\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "I watched a lot of movies and it had been a long time (over the pandemic year/s) since I have seen such a gripping thriller involving a family. In Run, a mother and a daughter's relationship starts to strain when the latter suspects her mother is doing ill on her. As you continue to guess what it might be, Run takes you by surprise. It delivers the goods and it keeps you hooked till the last second. Go, watch it already!", "If you doubt the need for another Austen, let this gorgeous film change your mind. Instead of ignoring the offers made to the period film genre by great films like 'Anna Karenina' and <a href=\u201c/article/review-the-favourite-a-delicious-work-of-magnificent-insanity\u201c>'The Favourite'</a>, 'Emma.' runs with them, finding a new language for approaching the great works of one of the great writers, realising her wit and humour in new and exciting ways while honouring the deep intelligence and generosity within them. I spent the entirety of Autumn de Wilde's wonderful film with the dumbest smile on my face, mixed with peals of laughter and gushing tears of joy. This is how we must approach the great classics - a celebration of what we love about them and an engagement with how they can speak to us here and now. That's how and why they can continue to matter so much.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-emma-a-dazzling-new-adaptation-of-jane-austens-classic", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nEmma. is Autumn de Wilde's feature film directorial debut, as well as Eleanor Catton's screenwriting debut. I never watched any previous adaptations and period movies aren't exactly \"my thing\". This doesn't mean I can't appreciate them! The Favourite and Little Women are the most recent examples of films belonging to said genre that I absolutely love. The main reason why I felt the need to watch this adaptation was Anya Taylor-Joy's first time as the sole protagonist.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe she'll become one of the greatest actresses of her generation, along Florence Pugh, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Hailee Steinfeld, Kaitlyn Dever, Saoirse Ronan, and a few others. Her performance in this movie is yet another argument to validate my prediction. She's phenomenal as Emma! It took me a while to get used to her voice since she applies a much higher tone than her usual one. Seeing actors doing different accents is pretty common, but changing their voice as Anya does, even if it's a simple modification, it still shows how committed she was to her role.\r\n\r\nAs cliche as it might sound, she carries the whole story on her shoulders. She's the link that connects all storylines and characters. Without her, the film doesn't work, so her display had to be near-perfect. Anya demonstrates her range and emotional ability, as well as a seamless control of the complex and rich script. Most dialogues possess long sentences with sophisticated vocabulary, something only the best actors can deal with effortlessly.\r\n\r\nAnya shines, but her character does too. Emma's arc is quite interesting. Besides being \"handsome, clever and rich\", she has no respect for the poor, manipulates her friend's romantic decisions, and sometimes acts in a very selfish, arrogant manner. Her transformation into a better person is the most captivating arc of the screenplay, but it also demonstrates my main issue with the movie as a whole. Ten minutes in, and I knew everything that was going to happen.\r\n\r\nNow, I always try to avoid thinking too much ahead. But when it comes to relationships between characters, it's all so predictable and obvious to me that I can't help but guess the whole story. The same screenplay trick is used throughout to twist certain relationships, becoming repetitive and a bit dull. I never felt truly invested in the film until the one-hour mark. It's mostly well-paced, but when nothing is surprising, innovative, or creative regarding the overall narrative, there's not that much that can keep me captivated.\r\n\r\nThe first act is a tad confusing, with too many characters getting introduced too fast. Honestly, I just discovered while writing this review that a secondary character is supposed to be blood-related to one of the main ones. Story and characters are the two pillars of any movie. I've always written this. If these two don't work, then everything else crumbles. It's far from collapsing, it's actually very well-structured, but it's like these two pillars are just like thousands of others. There's no distinct characteristic that makes these unique.\r\n\r\nWeirdly enough, I never felt bored. The cast really does a nice job of keeping me entertained by every remarkable performance. Bill Nighy (Mr. Woodhouse) and Miranda Hart (Miss Bates) are quite funny. The costume design is gorgeous besides being extremely important since it actually elevates the story by clearly identifying who's rich and poor. Production and set design are fantastic. Great cinematography (Christopher Blauvelt), and an enjoyable score (Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer). Nevertheless, as outstanding as the technical achievements might be, the film still lacks a unique directing style, which is normal, having in mind it's the director's first feature.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Emma. doesn't reach the latest period movies' level like The Favourite or Little Women, but it's a fine start for debutants director Autumn de Wilde and screenwriter Eleanor Catton. Anya Taylor-Joy delivers an exceptional performance as a very well-written Emma Woodhouse, carrying the film on her shoulders until the very end, cementing her place in Hollywood as one of the greatest actresses of her generation. The rest of the cast is also pretty great. The costume design steals the \"technical show\", but the production level in this movie is impressive. However, the narrative lacks surprising elements, making the existence of this new adaptation a bit questionable. Why make another film if there's nothing unique about it? Predictable from the get-go, confusing first act, and very hard to feel invested before the one-hour mark. If you enjoy period comedy-dramas, I recommend it. Otherwise, the two movies mentioned above are probably a better choice...\r\n\r\nRating: C+", "When I saw the previews for this latest interpretation of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, I envisioned a reimagining of the classic, with the plot or the setting radically changed with creative license applied liberally throughout. I was ready to not like it.\r\n\r\nBut instead I discovered that wondrous creativity was launched to make small tweaks to details. There was Harriet Smith, who may have been plain, but marching here and there with her classmates, dressed in matching red dresses and large hats, providing a very striking Image for the eye. There were the chorale music resonating at the end of scenes, leading to or melding into the beginning of the next scene. And Bill Nighy, who was suitably wary of illness and draughts, but had a spring in his step at times to juxtapose with his fearfully cautious nature.\r\n\r\nI thought Rupert Graves and Miranda Hart were imaginative choices for the roles of Mr. Weston and Miss Bates. And there is even an creative tweak to the one-word title, whereby a period is added after the name to indicate that the movie is - wait for it - a period piece.\r\n\r\nSo this is the third version of Emma in the past 25 years - two movies and a mini-series - and for now at least, it is my favorite.", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIf you've been following me for a while, you know I'm not the biggest fan of rom-coms. It's not that I don't like the genre (I appreciate and enjoy every single one), but I find its movies tremendously difficult to *really* love. The massive majority follow the genre's formulas and cliches to such an extent that I rarely end up truly loving one of these films. Some are way too cheesy. Others are way too unrealistic and dream-like. But the aspect that throws me off the most is the lack of originality. I can't remember the last rom-com I watched that didn't borrow from countless other installments. I didn't know a thing about Palm Springs: no trailers, no knowledge of critics/audience's opinion, nothing... And I'm extremely happy about that!\r\n\r\nI usually watch the main trailer for every film I review *after* I've seen the actual movie. I ignore all other trailers, clips, images, and so on. I do this so I can have some sort of knowledge regarding how far I can take my spoiler-free reviews. This way, I'm sure that I don't write about something I shouldn't. The official trailer for this film doesn't ruin the experience in any way, but it does tell its viewers the most relevant aspect of its screenplay. So, I could address it in this review, but I won't... because I enjoyed this movie a lot more, not knowing a thing about it than if I knew how it developed its story.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I'll keep it really vague, and just write that Andy Siara's first feature-film screenplay can easily snatch a couple of nominations when the awards season comes around. This is a rom-com like no other due to its refreshingly unique concept. It's true that it's not an entirely new method of storytelling. Many other movies also employ this idea, but Siara holds so many surprises within his narrative and so few of the genre's common traits that the whole film is elevated by his outstanding writing.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the most entertaining movies of the year. With a short runtime and a fast pace, Palm Springs is constantly being genuinely fun, engaging, and even mysteriously intriguing. Its original plot makes the viewer think and remember previous lines that take a whole different meaning a few minutes later. There are no predictably dumb narrative decisions, and its characters escape the cheesy and forced relationships that these films usually insert them in. The dialogues are hilariously captivating. Almost every single plot point packs an emotional punch, a jaw-dropping revelation that never crossed the viewer's mind.\r\n\r\nAndy Samberg and Cristin Milioti share such great chemistry. Their characters are exceptionally developed, and their relationship feels incredibly real. I'm rarely that viewer who requires the main characters to be together, kiss, fall in love, and all that, but Nyles and Sarah are two wonderful protagonists I can definitely root for. Both carry an interesting \"baggage\", which is also explored at a deep level. They deal very differently with the \"situation\" that the story puts them in, and it's so much fun to watch them go through it and evolve as characters. Oh, and J.K. Simmons (Roy)... this man doesn't know how not to be utterly remarkable!\r\n\r\nMax Barbakow (directorial debut) demonstrates his talents as well, by allowing Siara's screenplay to shine under impeccable direction. Tonally, it never loses its balance. It keeps its comedy pretty grounded, considering the craziness of its premise. It never relies on the genre's formulas, cliches, and cheesy outcomes. It really separates itself from the majority of modern rom-coms. I don't really have any flaws to point out... The ending does have a \"just accept it\" narrative component, and there are a couple of unnecessary scenes, but I'm nitpicking here.\r\n\r\nI can't believe I'm going to write this, but Palm Springs is not only one of the best rom-coms I've ever seen, but it's also one of the best (if not *the* best) movies of 2020, so far. With the help of their first-time director (Max Barbakow), Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti spread their extraordinary chemistry all over the innovative, original narrative, written by the also debutant, Andy Siara. The latter is undoubtedly the main responsible for such an entertaining film. Siara takes an imaginative concept and develops it in the most captivating, fun, hilarious, and even intriguing way possible. A surprising screenplay packed with emotionally impactful plot points, revelations, and twists that keep the enjoyment levels extremely high. The two protagonists are exceptionally developed, as well as their compelling relationship. With a fast pace and a perfect balance of its tone, Palm Springs sets itself apart from the other movies of the genre, staying away from all of the cliches, formulas, and stereotypes associated with it. J.K. Simmons also lends his awesomeness because why not? Whether you're a fan of rom-coms or not, I definitely suggest giving this one a look. You won't be disappointed!\r\n\r\nRating: A", "Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend, especially for fans of \"time shifting\" tropes.\r\n\r\nTime shifting is where your mind goes back in time, but not your body.  Essentially everything resets like a save point, except your have all this knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Time shifting\" was made popular by \"Groundhog's Day\" and there have been several movies that mainly consist of dying / sleeping and repeating like a video game, and this isn't THAT different with a few exceptions that make all the difference in the experience.\r\n\r\nAndy Samberg (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) finally steps up and shows everyone that he can do a somewhat serious role, and not just a straight man.  Cristin Milioti (How I Met Your Mother) does an excellent job in her lead role, with a great supporting cast, to include J.K. Simmons (Cave Johnson) leading a wonderful supporting cast, except for Tyler Hoechlin (CW Superman: \"Supergirl\", \"Flash\", etc.), who I might just not like because he was Superman, but it's supposed to be an disliked character...so....good job?\r\n\r\nThe medium of the transfer being shown is an interesting option as we saw in the \"Happy Death Day\" movies, but it does allow for a reasoning of how it works, can it be broken / manipulated as opposed to divine will.  Most importantly, it allows for more than just one subject being affected, which is really where it gets set apart.\r\n\r\nThe trope bleeds a little when you have multiple people trapped in the loop: you have multiple people trapped in a thing: you have multiple people trapped in a prison.  When multiple people are trapped in a environment together, they tend to get a little strange, and we get that sort of thing a plenty.  Because we have multiple story threads to follow, we're almost seeing 3 stories all overlapping, and the movie does a great job of showing those, whether or not their in chronological order, or happening at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhether you see it as a prison break movie, or a time loop movie, this movie has a lot of fun in it, along with deep metaphysical philosophy, so there is something for everyone.", "Palm Springs puts a new spin on the old time loop story, and I am surprised at how well it works. Andy Samberg is fantastic as ever and shows off a little more acting chops than I give him credit for with the more emotional scenes in the film. The chemistry that he and Christin Milloti share is spectacular and felt so incredibly genuine. I felt so many things during this movie ranging from happiness, sadness, and laughter, it really takes you for a ride and it is such a fantastic one at that. This is such an underrated film and I cannot recommend this enough.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_", "'I Still Believe' is just another forgettable romantic film, and thankfully it's also forgettable in the religious film genre.

But, let us start at the beginning. A US military convoy is transporting an unknown cargo from Area 51. The two soldiers in the cab of the truck debate the contents of the box (\u201cthe original draft of the Constitution written in the blood of the Founding Fathers\u2026 Amelia Earhart, long live \", etc.).

Hero is offered a job. Hero turns down job. Hero changes his mind and takes the job. Hero assembles team. And so on and so forth. So as to leave no clich\u00e9 unused, the hero also has an estranged daughter, Kate (Ella Purnell); this, however, deserves some more attention.\r\n\r\nKate works in a quarantine camp for zombies, which is nothing short of a logic-defying concept. It is first established that the zombie bite takes immediate effect, transforming the victim into another zombie \u2013 and one does not quarantine a zombie; one shoots a zombie in the head and moves on.\r\n\r\nNow, it has always been a habit of zombie movies to play fast and loose, depending on the requirements of the script, with the time it takes for a bite to kick in, but two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.

I anticipated being blown away by many movies that I knew nothing about or didn't recognize the crew and cast involved. I expected some films to emotionally impact me so much that I'd save them close to my heart until the very end of the year. With this said, I was unbelievably far from imagining that the very first viewing would be a heavy contender for my absolute favorite movie of the entire festival.\r\n\r\nCODA (Child Of Deaf Adults) is the first film I watch by Si\u00e2n Heder, and after this session, I can't wait to see what she did so far and what she's going to do in the future. The clearly interesting premise is developed through a much more emotional narrative than I expected. From rich visual storytelling to exceptional use of sign language, Heder is able to capture something unique and deeply important to transmit to the audience and to today's society. The world was fortunate enough to get Sound of Metal last year, and CODA reinforces the essential message that being deaf must not be seen as a massive disability or a brutal handicap.\r\n\r\nAs the movie cleverly communicates through its impeccable screenplay, having some sort of \"limitation\" doesn't automatically characterize someone as weird, different, or that the respective family members don't love each other as much or more than the so-called \"normal\" families. Except for a somewhat insignificant love relationship featuring the main character (that could have brought up an entirely different, unnecessary, and even distracting topic to the film's central, vital themes), I was incredibly invested in every single storyline.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I find every interaction within the deaf family much more compelling and captivating than any other dialogue in the movie, and this is mostly due to the amazing performances from the cast. Leaving the protagonist to the end, Daniel Durant (Leo Rossi, brother) and Marlee Matlin (Jackie Rossi, mother) are great as supporting characters, but Troy Kotsur (Frank Rossi, father) and Eugenio Derbez (Bernardo Villalobos, music teacher) literally left me in tears with their heartfelt displays. I could feel the outstanding commitment to their roles, and I'm delighted that Bernardo Villalobos isn't just another stereotypical, cliche, hysterical choir adult.\r\n\r\nHowever, the biggest praise in my bag must go to powerful glue that holds everything together, elevating the whole film to a whole other level: Emilia Jones as the only hearing member of the family, Ruby Rossi. First of all, I love music, and Pentatonix is actually my favorite group (acapella or not), so hearing so many wonderful voices singing together would always be a massive plus for CODA in my review. Nevertheless, not only Jones' voice is sumptuously heartwarming, but her performance has everything an actor needs to receive acting nominations. I can't remember the last time I was fully invested in a single character in such an emotionally powerful manner, and Jones is definitely a major reason.\r\n\r\nA final praise to Paula Huidobro's visually grabbing camera work and Marius de Vries, who composed the movie's subtle yet efficient score and who I'm guessing had a hand in the song choices. Either way, terrific job.\r\n\r\nCODA may very well end up as my favorite film of the 2021's edition of the Sundance Film Festival, and it will undoubtedly become a must-watch movie when it's available worldwide. Si\u00e2n Heder offers her impeccable direction and beautifully written screenplay, which is packed with emotionally powerful moments that left me tearing up for the last forty-five minutes. Boasting an educative, meaningful message regarding the deaf community and what our society perceives as a tremendous handicap/disability, the characteristic visual storytelling and the captivating interactions within the deaf family prove to be incredibly investing, deeply elevating the overall piece. With the help of heartfelt, genuine performances from the supporting cast (mainly Troy Kotsur and Eugenio Derbez), Emilia Jones takes off and lands one of my favorite female performances in a long, long time. A tear-inducing, thoughtful film that I hope will conquer audiences all around the world.\r\n\r\nRating: A", "I cannot think of one person to whom I wouldn\u2019t recommend \u201cCODA,\u201d an uplifting, emotionally rich movie from writer / director Sian Heder. This crowd-pleasing film is one of the first real gems to debut at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, and I\u2019m still riding the wave of good vibes hours later.\r\n\r\nBeing a teenager is difficult enough, but try being Ruby (Emilia Jones). The 17-year-old is the only hearing member of a deaf family, and she spends most of her spare time working on her parents\u2019 (Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur) fishing boat along with her older brother, Leo (Daniel Durant). and serving as their sign language interpreter. Ruby juggles her family responsibilities, her schoolwork, and a newfound passion for her high school\u2019s choir club (and her cute duet partner, Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo)). When her music teacher (Eugenio Derbez) hears that special something in Ruby\u2019s voice, he encourages her to think about a life beyond fishing and supports her in applying to a prestigious music school. This unfairly puts the responsibility of the household on Ruby\u2019s shoulders, and she must choose between keeping her family afloat or pursuing her dreams.\r\n\r\nThis very funny and very honest story has a universal appeal, with charming performances and a likeable family that you\u2019ll want to spend time with. Kotsur and Matlin are terrific as Ruby\u2019s randy parents, and Derbez brings a genuine charisma to his role as the young woman\u2019s mentor. The cast includes three deaf actors, so much of the dialogue is expressed in sign language \u2014 and everything about that feels normal. This film goes a long way in shattering stereotypes about people who are hearing impaired, and that is to be commended.\r\n\r\nHeder has created a film that\u2019s filled with insight, refreshingly direct dialogue, and a fully developed cast of characters that all add up to solid storytelling all around. Not only is this a coming-of-age story for Ruby, but it\u2019s one for her family, too. The four of them struggle through the disappointment that life throws their way, hoping to work together to emerge stronger than ever.\r\n\r\nHeartfelt but never corny, \u201cCODA\u201d is a really special movie about unwavering support, unconditional love, and what it means to be a family.", "**Full Review and Analysis at SpotaMovie.com**\r\nProduced and released by Apple in 2021, CODA is an inspiring movie. It delivers music and voice to deaf people, highlighting important topics. **The Story:** Ruby is the only hearing person in her deaf family. They run a small business as fishermen, and she helps and supports them, mainly translating everything to her family in the deaf signs language. As a result, she splits her life between her family and her dreams.\r\nRuby discovers an incredible talent, something that makes her feel alive and happy. But the two worlds are not easily manageable for her because society and her parents are not ready to understand each other. Ruby\u2019s role becomes crucial for her family, especially when a new law threatens their business and future. Therefore to keep her dreams moving forward, she will need to fight, sacrifice and change the reality around her story. Fortunately, Ruby meets an incredible character during her journey and something powerful will happen. It\u2019s an engaging story. **Opinion**: It\u2019s a film of revolution, passion, family and friendships. It teaches us about integration and shows us the difficulty deaf people face every day. The pieces of music are perfect, and the film has pace and rhythm. The performance delivered by the actors is incredible and makes the movie more engaging. It's a must watch in our opinion because it makes us better person.", "Admittedly, there is nothing brilliantly creative about the script, which is why I gave it only 8 stars. The elevator story: a teenager trying to find, and assert, herself in the world and her family, who itself is struggling to remain commercially viable in an industry that's been devastated by commercialism and global warming. The wrinkle in the story is that the protagonist's parents and brother are all deaf. (CODA = Child of Deaf Adults.)\r\n\r\nThat's where ho-hum departs, and I have two things to say about it: First, this film deserves all the accolades and awards it's received. Second, this may the first time I've known a remake to exceed by far the original.\r\n\r\nThe acting from nearly everyone in the cast is unbelievably great. The production values are fantastic. The film is incredibly hilarious (thanks to brilliant performance by Troy Kotsur), and also, surprisingly emotional.

It made me feel a huge range of emotions and has a very satisfying ending. The script is excellent and it is elevated due to fantastic performances from the entire cast. Joaquin Phoenix is superb and his chemistry with both Woody Norman and Gaby Hoffmann is excellent. Norman was great, he had such a wide range for a young actor and was able to make his emotions feel genuine, which is difficult in a lot of child actors. Hoffman was also quite good, she displays her helplessness to care for both her son and ex-husband tremendously well. Cinematography was top notch and the audio design was brilliant. There are some really cool things that are done with the interview sections/street recordings that create a very unique listening experience. My one complaint is that the movie drags on a little longer than it should. There is not a lot going on in this film, and that is fine because you get to spent time with the characters and see their relationship blossom. But that creates a very slow pace that could have been corrected with a slightly shorter runtime.\r\n\r\nScore: 79%\r\nVerdict: Great", "seriously i haven't watched any of bella throne's movie before but i loved the way she acted in this movie. loved the way of direction from directors really. loved alyvia's acting too. i came to know about the movie from her though. she's really doing well. loved the ending as well it was really unexpected. big love to all the team.", "Generally I love crime-thrillers (both fiction and non-fiction) and this had some good elements, but the editing was shoddy, performances uneven with Bruce Willis once again phoning it in.

Lukas Haas as the serial killer has his moments though his performance and the character isn't anything different than what had been done on Criminal Minds.\r\n\r\nWanted to really like this but never quite works.

It's fine, but it just doesn't resonate terribly well with me. Not to mention it feels a bit like a stage-play, taking place all on one street. I understand it's supposed to be the world through a child's eyes, but there's not much there. Conversations and issues feel breezed through, and yet 'Belfast' sags in the middle around the third time they have the same set of conversations. It's good enough, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone.", "A swell little film, this.\r\n\r\nI may not have a connection to the events portrayed onscreen, but <em>'Belfast'</em> is - despite the not so good true events that it's retelling - is a pleasant film to watch. With a perfectly timed length of around 90 minutes, this 2021 flick holds a lot of heart - it's also rather funny, it had me laughing a fair number of times.\r\n\r\nThe star of the film is undoubtedly youngster Jude Hill, who is an absolute joy in the role of Buddy - some performance from the 11-year-old! Buddy's connections with every single character are lovely, especially with those played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds and Judi Dench - wait... that was Judi Dench?! I legit didn't even notice until the end credits, which shows how convincing her performance as a Northern Irish grandmother is... or perhaps I need my eyesight tested, who's to say.\r\n\r\nJamie Dornan and Caitr\u00edona Balfe also merit props, in what is a very good release from Kenneth Branagh & Co. The target audience, along with others of course, will adore it, I'm sure. Also... love the choice of black-and-white, fwiw.", "Belfast is packed with powerful images \u2014 shot in Haris Zambarloukos\u2019s majestic black-and-white cinematography (except for a handful of color shots at key moments, notably the escapist windows that film and TV offer the characters) \u2014 beginning with an early scene in which the young protagonist, Buddy (Jude Hill), armed with a wooden sword and a shield/dumpster lid, confronts a mob of unionist protestants who come to attack the houses and businesses of Catholics on Buddy\u2019s Street.\r\n\r\nIn an inferior movie, Buddy would be foolish enough to think that his makeshift weapons could measure up to the rioters\u2019 Molotov cocktails; here, however, it marks precisely the beginning of the end of childhood innocence \u2014 a point driven home later by a reading of chapter thirteen of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (\"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but then I became a man and left childish things behind\u201d).\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s depictions of violence are doubly effective because Branagh resorts to them sparingly, and when he does, he shoots them in a realistic style; when a car explodes in the middle of the street, you can bet your sweet ass it doesn\u2019t just go up in CGI flames.\r\n\r\nThe most striking images, however, are those whose composition evokes an air of domesticity; several of them have in common the background presence, as if detached from the action, of Judi Dench. Branagh, who has collaborated with her on almost a dozen productions, knows very well that the veteran actress is able to conjure, simply by virtue of being there, enough gravitas to anchor a scene in the real world (now, this is not to say that Dench is reduced to prop status; quite the contrary, her character provides the emotional center of the history).\r\n\r\nThese images stay with us because they are all about what is at stake in the film: a fragile lifestyle in which \u201cWe have known this street and all the streets around it all our lives. And every man, woman, and child that lives in every damn house, whether we like it or not. And I like it. And you say you have a little garden for the boys? But here, they can play wherever they want, because everyone knows them, everyone loves them, and everyone cares for them.\u201d Establishing this delicate way of life is the reason that the threat of violence is so much more effective in creating tension than the violence itself.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, Belfast is an episodic slice-of-life-seen-through-a-young-boy\u2019s-eyes that isn\u2019t, believe it or not, a million miles removed from A Christmas Story, and indeed the script introduces a placid, elementary sense of humor that nicely counterbalances the more dramatic material.", "This is the kind of cinema that we always hope to see - brilliantly fresh, tight script, beautifully shot, amazing performances, an autobiographical-based story of the directory himself, Sir Kenneth Branagh, and ... Van Morrison soundtrack. In essence, it's a coming-of-age movie of an adolescent, set against \"The Troubles\" of Northern Ireland. Buddy has a special love for movies and theater, encouraged by his cranky, old grandmother (Dame Judi Dench). The beautiful relationship between the grandfather and grandmother is mirrored perfectly in the mother and father, and then again in Buddy's budding romance with Catherine. There's so much going on in the film that it's very nearly a tone poem.", "\"**Space Sweepers**\" is South Korea's first-ever space science fiction show. For their first venture into space, they did not disappoint and made sure audiences were awed by the show's deep story and unforgettable space adventure.\r\n\r\n> **Space Sweepers** ***is lightyears better from recent Western space scifi shows.***\r\n\r\n## Story\r\nThe story started out as a typical Western space scifi. Humanity encountered a life threatening situation and the only way out was up, out there in outer space. Slowly and perfectly the Korean signature in storytelling and plots surfaced up and it started to get very interesting.\r\n\r\nThere was a grand or overarching story guiding Space Sweepers but they instead zoomed-in and told the story from a human perspective. This approach allowed them to tackle the questions from the vantage point of ordinary humans, attaching the audiences to the characters in ways not possible from a \"bigger picture\" method. A story about a crew of \"Space Sweepers\" but at the same time it was not about them.\r\n\r\nIt is rare to see this type of story and storytelling in live-action movies considering the limited time available and yet they were able to flesh out the characters, presented a family relationship plots, questioned human moralities and ethics, and explored the notion about \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\".\r\n\r\n## Acting/Cast\r\nThe casting was excellent. Song Joong Ki, playing as \"Tae Ho\", and Kim Tae Ri, playing as \"Captain Jang\", are two popular and veteran Korean actors. They were joined in by Jin Seon Kyu as \"Tiger Park\", Yoo Hae Jin as the Robot, and the child actress Park Ye Rin as \"Dorothy\". Five actors who complimented each others' acting style enabled them to bring the story closer to the audience.\r\n\r\nKim Tae Ri is best known from her 2016 movie \"The Handmaiden\" and the Netflix TV series \"Mr. Sunshine\" in 2018. Despite the huge jump from historical romance genre to a space scifi action and adventure, Kim Tae Ri has proven once again her talent in acting. She showed her character's strength and fierceness and yet behind it all she was caring and loving.\r\n\r\nSong Joong Ki is well known from his major role in the hugely popular 2016 TV series \"Descendants of the Sun\". He masterfully played his character, a man who lost his daughter in a tragedy and ended up as a sweeper of space debris to make his living. Throughout the movie, he showed perfectly the thoughts and goals of his character despite of what was in front of him. His emotions and expressions were in check, thus completing the aura of his character while at the same time letting the audience feel his sadness and difficult choices.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention is the child actress Park Ye Rin. She is technically a newbie in the industry, having only appeared as a guest in a 2020 TV series. Having thrown in a blockbuster film this early would have a huge challenge for her and yet she amazingly showed that she was born an actress. She played as \"Dorothy\", one of the key characters in this film. This being a space scifi, which means they had a lot of filming in front of green screens, Park Ye Rin was not distracted and was able to deliver her dialogues and interacted with her co-stars naturally. Oh, did I not say that she's only 7 years old?\r\n\r\n## Production\r\nThey did not shy away from giving this a budget. The superb visual effects, cgi, and editing, definitely placed this movie equal in rank with Western shows like \"Star Trek\" and \"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy\" to name two.\r\n\r\nIt was also a brilliant idea to bring in actors from different nationalities and to use their native languages. This is rarely done and is simply explained as some magic or technology like a \"universal translator\". But that's not where it ends \u2026 even though they have a \"universal translator\", they did not resorted to \"English\" or \"Korean\" as a \"universal language\". They showed all directors in the world how to properly portray different languages even if there is a \"universal translator\" available.\r\n\r\nThat deserves a huge mention especially for a show which concerns multiple nationalities, languages, and cultures--the planet Earth. The flow of the story was not broken even though the characters were speaking different languages. Everything was flowing smoothly, this is how it actually will be like if \"universal translators\" become a reality. Well done!\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nWhile this is a space science fiction film, the story was about you and me, being a human, and the relationships we build in each of our adventures. This is what \"Space Sweepers\" was about. It is about you and me. Our humanity. Our frailties. The challenges we face every single day and how to ultimately triumph (or not).\r\n\r\nCan you guess how many languages were spoken and nationalities represented in \"Space Sweepers\"?\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nOriginally posted on my [blog](https://youronly.one/yuki/review-space-sweepers-2021-202137/) under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 International License.", "\"Army of the Dead was far from surpassing any expectations, but amid its several issues, Zack Snyder actually created a rather interesting post-apocalyptic world.

Matthias delivers a fun, engaging performance that, unfortunately, is partially damaged by the excessive, dull jokes.

The only connection to the HBO series is Michael Imperioli, and even then it's just his voice used as little more than en excuse for some lame retrospective dramatic irony.\r\n\r\nWhen he sees Tony for the first time, baby Christopher starts crying his eyes out; someone takes the opportunity to randomly comment that \u201cSome babies, when they come into the world, know all kinds of things from the other side\u201d. So baby Chris could somehow sense that uncle Tony was going to eventually murder him in cold blood? And if so, a fat lot of good that prescience did him. \r\n\r\nAs for the audience, we (even casual viewers like myself) remember very well that Tony Soprano strangled Christopher Moltisanti (which means 'many saints', hence the title of the film), because it\u2019s practically the first thing that Imperioli tells us in the opening narration (to paraphrase Borges, saying something too much is almost as bad as not saying it). \r\n\r\nWriters David Chase and Lawrence Konner and director Alan Taylor even manage to ruin the only good thing about this piece of crap movie; i.e., the late, great Ray Liotta, who must have been paid very good money \u2014 and completely deserved it for appearing in this debacle \u2014 because the filmmakers kill off his character half an hour into the movie, just to introduce his identical twin (and I mean identical to a T; how many pairs of twins are still getting exactly the same haircuts in their late 60s?). \r\n\r\nSomeone at New Line must have thought that Liotta was overpaid and demanded that the actor pulled double duty; how else to explain this farcical turn of events?", "Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nIt's usually a good sign when the worst part of a time travel movie is the time travel.\r\n\r\nI could probably make an hour long video on the time travel in this movie, especially compared to \"Looper\", but I'll forego that enough to say that it's well leveraged for the purposes of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe \"White Spikes\" are amazingly well put together, though I think projectile spikes are an odd biological evolution.\r\n\r\nThe story is far from perfect, but the cast, the acting, the situation, and especially the action are all executed wonderfully with a high production value to back it up.", "**Overall : A fun popcorn sci-fi blockbuster with fun characters, scary aliens, and great action that far outweigh its minor faults.**\r\n\r\nThe Tomorrow War is a fun fighting alien creatures, time travel, sci-fi action flick that thoroughly entertains despite its flaws. The film's premise lends to some confusion with trying to change timelines, leading to moments of disjointed logic and confusing plot points. But let me be honest, if you don't take the science seriously, you will enjoy the movie. The aliens are super creepy and overwhelming. Transporting soldiers to the future to help try to overcome a failing war for survival provides a fresh take on the alien battle trope. I enjoyed the parts of the movie that took place in the future where the risk and danger were higher than the present-day parts that were more focused on exposition. Because The Tomorrow War was released straight to streaming, I had low expectations that were undeniably exceeded. I will be back to watch this one again.", "_Bones and All_ is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. It somehow simultaneously disgusts me while filling me with intense emotion capable of drawing tears to my eyes. It is a perfect blend, that I was unaware that I needed.\r\n\r\nThe journey our characters take in immense in terms of emotion and distance. I had such a great time watching our leads travel across country going wherever their hearts desired or wherever their noses took them. There were some creepy and intense encounters that had me on the edge of my seat but that was balanced with intimate moments between our leads. These scenes fill the majority of the 2 hour and twenty-minute runtime, and while that is a decently long film, it flew by, and the pace never seemed to lull. There were some scenes that could have been cut to save some time, but I argue that they were essential for character development and to make the film whole.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the runtime there are intense introspective themes of morality that are at constant play. Watching the characters balance desire and need was so heartbreaking and real. Despite the horrific acts our main characters are performing, there is a deep hidden shame that seeps out as our character learns more and more about what she is.\r\n\r\nThese are very complex emotions to handle on screen and our two leads absolutely nailed it. Both Taylor Russell and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were brilliant! I will be honest, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is one of the big reasons why I wanted to see this movie so much and while he did an excellent job, he was outshined by Taylor Russell. She was so excellent, honestly perfect! This is the first film I have seen her in, and I was blown away. She deserves all the award recognitions for this film.\r\n\r\nBones and All is a masterpiece and needs to be seen in theaters. This is a hard movie to sell to an audience, but it was done perfectly and deserves all the credit, awards, and viewership.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _94%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Masterpiece_", "A beautiful and intense coming of age story", "Where has the \"magic\" gone? Disney muddles the mix once again and ruins a childhood favorite by removing the accomplished Buzz frontman Tim Allen for Chris Evans? I was so wanting to see the quick quips and humor a comedian such as Allen has always brought to the Toy Story franchise and sadly they went the other direction here. Formulaic and predictable. This could have been any other space-based children's animation.", "Lightyear is a lighthearted and fun sci-fi adventure. Let me get this out of the way first and foremost, the visuals in this film are spectacular. The artists who did this deserve a raise because this might be the best looking animated film I have ever scene. I really enjoyed the touch of changing the resolution at a certain point. With that out of the way, I really enjoyed this film, the exploration of a new world was really well done. I liked the time traveling elements that were presented, borrowing some from Interstellar, and it brought some really sad moments that nearly drew a tear from me. The cast of characters were funny and their evolution throughout the story was a joy to watch. I was not super impressed with this movies interpretation of Zurg.

It encapsulates an era like no other and dares to be so different, yet so appealing. On the surface this film is a very straightforward plot, following our three leads and their attempts at success in the ever-changing world of cinema. But deep down, there is another message that is so relevant to everyone's life: accepting death/irrelevance.\r\n\r\nJust as fast as our characters achieve their dreams of being stars in the industry, these dreams are quickly whisked away by the brutality and cutthroat nature of Hollywood. This is juxtaposed with Brad Pitts character, a man already on downward spiral of his career, trying to desperately hold on to what remains. These arches are so honest and vulnerable, I found very compelling.\r\n\r\nThe performances were top notch all around, and I would expect nothing more from a stacked cast of actors including Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt. But the surprise of the bunch was Diego Calva. He was fantastic and stole many scenes he was featured in with both Robbie and Pitt. He is the true lead of this film and does an excellent job bearing the load.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed almost aspects of the film, but towards the end there are some sequences that I feel got away from Chazelle. They are so over the top and kind of feal out of place in this somewhat grounded story. The tension is there in these scenes, but it just doesn't fit. This whole subplot could have been shorten tremendously helping reduce the bloated runtime of the film.\r\n\r\nThat being, I never really felt the length of this picture with it being quite well paced. Overall, this movie was real treat, and it is quite a shame that marketing was jumbled up so poorly because this film deserves viewership.\r\n\r\nScore: 88%\r\nVerdict: Excellent\r\nTheatre Verdict: See It", "**Thor: Love and Thunder** is a sequel to the 2017 film Thor: Ragnarok. It is written and directed by Taika Waititi and based on, of course, the Marvel Comics by Stan Lee. The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster / Mighty Thor, and Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher.\r\n\r\nAnd the story? The gods are in danger! The God Butcher is coming for them! And only the mightiest of them all can stop him: Thor. But Thor is in bad shape. He's lost his hammer, his friends, and his confidence. He'll need all the help he can get to save the day. He'll have to relearn what it means to be a hero, and Jane Foster will have to become the Mighty Thor.\r\n\r\nI was looking forward to this movie. I loved Taika Waititi's direction in Ragnarok, and the cast is amazing. I was hoping for another fun, fast-paced, and humorous film like its predecessor. But unfortunately, Thor: Love and Thunder falls flat. The story is convoluted and slow-moving, and there are too many characters for any of them to get enough development. The humour is forced, and it frequently fails. And the ending is just...Stranger things have happened, I suppose.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in **Thor: Love and Thunder**. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, you might enjoy it, but if you're looking for another fun and exciting Thor film, I think you'll be disappointed, too.", "Bad humor, characters teleporting all over the place, terrible plot. A thing capable of altering the universe happens to exist, you don't even need infinity stones *facepalm* I can't believe there is a worse Thor movie than The Dark World.", "Best Movie by MARVEL. LOVE YOU THOR", "Nice actin movie.", "It appears that disgraced asshat Bob Chapek (not going to link to IMDb for this asshat since his bio there is just corporate gibberish written by Disney themselves, and not updated to show that he got fired) has scared away any form of actual talent from Disney so that even when they do something that is not blatantly woke and preaching it still turns into a turd.\r\n\r\nAlready in the first scenes I was going what the f\u2026 is this? Are they turning the franchise into a comedy?\r\n\r\nThor himself has been turned into a rambling moron. The rest of the Gods are either unbelievable assholes or fat slobs only caring about their orgies or some combination thereof. Most of the movie I was just cringing in my seat.\r\n\r\nIf they were actually going for more of a comedy movie than an actual Thor movie they failed miserably. The \u201cjokes\u201d where unfunny, unintelligent and just bad. Superhero slapstick at best.\r\n\r\nThe only character that I found remotely likable and cool in the movie was King Valkyrie. Jane Foster was not too bad either. The rest was just a joke. The portrayal of the mighty God Zeus and Olympus was an affront. The bad guy was not too bad although I would not call him likable of course. He is not supposed to be likable. At least he was not turned into a parody.\r\n\r\nIt is really a shame because the underlying story is not half bad\u2026 if it had been given to someone with actual talent to implement. It is predictable of course but it is okay. If it had only been given to someone who could have turned it into a real Thor movie instead of this failed comedy turd.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that I did not have my hopes up very much when starting to watch this movie. Given what Disney has turned into I was afraid that they were literally going to turn Thor into a female and luckily that did not happen. Unfortunately they found another way of ruining the franchise. This movie is nothing like the previous Thor movies. I really liked Thor: The Dark World for example. To me this movie is very close to a franchise killer.\r\n\r\nThe one and a half stars is for the special effects. They were pretty good. The rest of this movie is really bad.", "_Halloween Ends_ is such a weird film, as a standalone movie I enjoyed it but in the trilogies totality it underwhelms and undermines. With each entry in this trilogy, the movies get farther and farther away from what Halloween is. With Ends there is no tension and no horror, there are some good kills but with nothing building up to it they felt stale. This movie also tears down Michael Meyers in a way that felt out of place in the trilogy. Halloween Kills built Michael up to be an indestructible force with the ability to withstand fire or multiple gunshot wounds, but in Ends that is flipped on its head making him weak due to the ending of the predecessor. It left me feeling like the writers had no idea what they were doing in developing this trilogy. The marketing of the movie was a total farce as well. It was building up to a final clash between Laurie and Michael, and while that does happen the majority follows a character that was just introduced (Corey Cunningham). Even though I really like the opening sequence and backstory to Corey, it had no place being centerstage in the final installment. Overall, this movie was slightly better than the sequel but still squanders the potential that Halloween (2018) had for the trilogy. If any more movies or trilogies are made in the future, please for the love of God hire a producer/writer to develop the entire series instead of piecing it together film by film.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _44%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Poor_", "**Poor writing and a confusing story overshadowed a few shining moments and satisfying conclusions to character stories.**\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so hard to choose whether I liked or disliked Halloween Ends. I enjoyed the resolution to Laurie Strode\u2019s 40-year story arc and the hopeful journey for her granddaughter, Allyson. Even the final showdown between Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers was satisfying, although the story didn\u2019t build to the climax well. Sadly that is where the pros stop. The story was a convoluted mess that ignored all the build-up of the first two films and focused on a new character that didn\u2019t matter to the overall story and didn\u2019t have much impact on the film. As a result, Halloween Ends forgot what made its two predecessors successful and told a pointless meandering tale that had its moments but ultimately disappointed.", "An unfortunate end, to a horror franchise, that started way back in 1978. \r\n\r\nHalloween Ends, is an inarticulate mess, that fails to build on past films. Instead, it delivers an incomprehensible story, that makes little to no sense, save that it brings the overriding story, to a somewhat confused, conclusion. \r\n\r\nOn the upside solid acting and some tense, jump scare moments but really, its not enough.\r\n\r\nIn summary, a reasonable cast in a poorly scripted film, that add's little to nothing that is meaningful, to the tale of serial killer, Michael Myers.", "It's a sad state of affairs when HALLOWEEN ENDS (2022) is being classed as a \"bad\", \"terrible\" or \"disgraceful\" motion picture and I worry for cinema as a whole if the only direction the mass want is nothing but cookie-cutter.\r\n\r\nThis film is a straaaaaaange beast and it probably holds the world record for the quickest development of a relationship on screen. Bloody hell, I wanted that relationship to succeed.\r\n\r\nI'm going to be controversial here... did we need Michael Myers at all here? Maybe the 2 or so scenes we get in the sewer early into the film and that's it... maybe pass the evil on and Michael die of his wounds.\r\n\r\nThe evil is contagious element worked for me and Corey (played by Rohan Campbell) was the standout character.\r\n\r\nIssues? Yes, there are some - the narration and memoir aspect weren't needed and Corey's mum... erm, I'll leave it there.\r\nBut I admire this film, oh boy do I. I'd rather the risk be taken than them fall back into the same old routine.\r\n\r\nNow, before I start the Corey Appreciation Society, all I have left to say is... give a new biscuit a try.", "Well there is a hewn-out pumpkin that looks ever so slightly scary... Otherwise, this is just one \"Halloween\" movie too many and it's only scream yells \"put me out of my misery\" pretty much from the start of this slow and plodding denouement to the franchise. Rohan Campbell (\"Corey\") is bullied by some kids who end up shoving him from a bridge. He is dragged into the storm drains by you know who and emerges a man possessed. He has also attached himself to \"Allyson\" (Andi Matichak) who just happens to be the daughter of long suffering \"Laurie\" (Jamie Lee Curtis) and after a bit of hysteric family melodrama, all of her demons are flee-flowing and we are heading, slowly and ponderously to a conclusion that the best of which has already been seen many times in the trailers. This is far too long, virtually nothing happens until the last fifteen minutes and even then, there isn't even the vaguest hint of menace or jeopardy. The production is adequate, but JLC doesn't really feature often enough - as in \"Halloween Kills\" (2021) to make much impact - and the whole thing is episodic and smacks of made for television. Please let it be the final instalment - this bears no resemblance whatsoever to the original 1978 introduction to \"Myers\" et al.", "Okay, seriously, when is the real \"Halloween Ends\" be released? What I saw for the bulk was some lame CW-like story. I have to think at this point David Gordon Green and the writer crew are just pulling a prank. I half expected a post-credit scene with Impractical Jokers...\r\n\r\nI don't even know what to say.

As such, I was extremely interested in the first chunk of this. It builds up nicely, revealing details here and there. The ending isn't as strong but I still dig it, don't get me wrong.\r\n\r\nThe cast are terrific, even if Florence Pugh completely wipes the floor with her co-stars... and I don't mean that negatively on them one bit, it's simply a case of Pugh giving an outstanding performance. This is only the third film of her's that I've seen... gotta watch more!\r\n\r\nAway from Pugh, I was impressed by Harry Styles. He can act. I will say, though, that Shia LaBeouf would've been greater in the role though. Elsewhere, Olivia Wilde (also dir.), Chris Pine and Gemma Chan do good things.\r\n\r\nIs it a perfect film? Not at all. Is it entertaining? Sure is. Each to their own, but I thoroughly enjoyed this 2022 release.", "Pretty cool, I wasn't expecting the reveal of what's really going on towards the end. Wish it leaned into the horror / unsettling aspects a bit more.", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling\u201d isn\u2019t the massive mess that so many predicted, but it does suffer from a few major problems. The script (written by Katie Silberman) lacks grace and polish, one star\u2019s questionable acting skills is amplified by the other lead\u2019s performance, and Olivia Wilde\u2018s direction is noticeably weak. But there\u2019s still something mesmerizing about this feminist-tinged film and its commentary on the supposed ideals of a patriarchal society.\r\n\r\nAlice (Florence Pugh) and Jack (Harry Styles) live a charmed life in the experimental utopia known as Victory. The town is exclusively for employees of the top-secret Victory Project and their families, and it\u2019s truly the most perfect place in the world \u2014 or so it seems. Company CEO Frank (Chris Pine) is the visionary behind it all, a stylish, confident leader whom the men all want to emulate. He provides everything the town\u2019s residents need, asking only for loyalty and obedience in return.\r\n\r\nVictory is a place that embodies the idyllic 1950s life, where the women cook and clean, dress to perfection, and spend their free time day drinking, lounging by the pool, and gossiping with friends. The men fulfill their role in this society too, by going to work at the mysterious headquarters and returning like clockwork in the evenings. It\u2019s a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell type of community, until Alice begins having strange, nightmarish visions. She begins to explore the more sinister side of Victory, hoping to eventually expose what\u2019s really going on beneath the facade of domestic bliss.\r\n\r\nThe plot is one that\u2019s been done before, and there isn\u2019t much by way of originality. What makes the first part of the film so successful is that the story is told from the point of view of the women in town. By presenting the narrative through the lens of an army of happy homemaker wives, there\u2019s an ominous tone throughout \u2014 especially when the ladies in town turn to self-harm in order to take back control of their lives.\r\n\r\nAlice is a strong female character, and Pugh proves yet again that she\u2019s one of the most exciting talents working in Hollywood today. Much is asked of her and she is up to the task of doing the heavy lifting here, especially in her many scenes with Styles. To put it bluntly, Pugh acts Styles under the table and then some. I believe the film would have been more successful with a more talented leading man.\r\nWhen the ending finally comes through a long drawn out reveal, it\u2019s a letdown that feels like an episode of \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d If you examine some of the film\u2019s earlier scenes, the story doesn\u2019t feel quite as airtight as it should.\r\n\r\nThe themes are excessive and overdone, presenting the conservative male ideal of relationships and life. It\u2019s a chilling statement about women\u2019s rights and responsibilities, and men\u2019s desire to control and dominate. The timing for this message couldn\u2019t be more perfect with the tumultuous political climate that\u2019s spreading around the world. As a woman, I appreciate the sentiment of \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling\u201d and the feminist lens in which its presented, but I just wish the film had been more successful overall.", "**Overall : A big YEP to NOPE!**\r\n\r\nJordan Peele\u2019s creativity is unrivaled! Nothing is typical of anything he does. Even knowing it is an alien movie, he keeps things fresh with surprising twists and eerie tension. Unlike anything I have seen before\u2014there is excellent symbolism through the flashback sequences. I also enjoyed the developing relationship between the main two characters. My only complaint is that the horror and dread so palpable at the beginning fades completely about two-thirds into the film.", "They said it and you wont hear me disagreeing with it. Did I find it entertaining? \"nope\". Did  I feel the story was cohesive and comprehensible, with a clear contextual message? \"nope\". Were characterisations relatable and relevant? \"Sort of\". \r\n\r\nNope's characterisations are moderately relatable but somehow, also seem to appear oddly misconstrued. The mostly monosyllabic cowboy character, for example, only adds to the sense of ambiguity (perhaps that's the idea).To my mind however, this ploy, if that's what it is, stifles development, of the already ambiguous, story line. The sister, his complete antithesis, is superficially verbose but seems equally, to lack any depth of self awareness.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can say conclusively about Nope, is the visuals are  compelling, complex and, at times, almost intricate. This film certainly scores a A+ in this regard. \r\n\r\nThat said, so much else is lacking, in particular a clearly articulated narrative, that it failed to resonate, with me. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I found Nope a frustrating, dissatisfying watch. Somewhat  reminiscent of M. Night\" Shyamalan films Nope is visually stunning but does  not offer up enough morsels of knowledge, leaving this viewer hungry for more.", "I do noi Ike horror movies as a rule, but I liked this one, so I suspect that \u201cNope\u201d didn\u2019t have enough gore or shocking surprises for the average fan of that genre.  I thought the acting and writing were fine, and the title was a subtle selection. The odd subplot of the incident with Gordy the monkey reminded me of the movie Magnolia for some reason. I wonder if that film was any kind of an influence on Jordan Peele\u2019s storytelling style?\r\n\r\nThe entity in this movie is rather quirky and odd as we learn how it operates and its likes and dislikes. I will say no more than that because learning about it is part of the fun, though I am sure it made it too slow moving for thriller fans. It won\u2019t be a favorite of mine, but it makes the short list of horror movies I have watched and liked just fine.", "All you all that like movies like this are going to be really embarrassed once it's not hip to be racist anymore.  You know, one this woke crap ends and we go back to judging people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.\r\n\r\nBut then isn't judging people by the content of their character \"racist\" today?  You have to judge by skin color right?\r\n\r\nThis is Peele, he makes a point about that, because once more all white people are idiots or evil, and now all Asians are idiots and evil too, because in woke culture they are \"white adjacent.\"\r\n\r\nIt's more veiled racism that people today applaud, call intelligent, and when the woke market ends, they are going to liken it to \"the Turner Diaries\"", "A really well made flick!\r\n\r\n<em>'Nope'</em> comes across as a pretty unique film, even if the core premise isn't necessarily that. I enjoyed seeing it all come together, the conclusion is the most entertaining part - as it ought to be, I guess. The cinematography, meanwhile, is ace.\r\n\r\nI also dig the special effects, although oddly I feel like the main thing's effect slightly (!) dropped off a bit towards the end - but that could just be the fact that we see more of it at that point, as opposed to the prior snippets.\r\n\r\nKeke Palmer is excellent throughout, the clear standout in my opinion. Daniel Kaluuya and Steven Yeun are also enjoyable, as are Michael Wincott and Brandon Perea to be fair - albeit less so. Neat to see Keith David involved too, I need to see him in a more prominant role at some point - only ever seems to be a bit-part in what I've seen of him thus far.", "It's quite fun to try and spot the famous names who pepper this otherwise puerile and really rather unfunny film - but that was about it for me. It's all about a \"Dante\" (Brian O'Halloran) and \"Elias\" (Trevor Fehrman) who run a small-town store. They spend much of their day quoting lines from their favourite films until poor old \"Elias\" has an heart attack. Whisked to hospital, his friends decide to make a film about life in their convenience store. What now ensues may well offer us an isight into just how a sudden medical emergency can focus the attention and motivate people, but I just found the references either too in-your-face or absurdly obscure and contrived. Perhaps this will rate better in the USA, but here in the UK this just comes across as a rather sad indictment of rural life where it's all about weed and dumb wheezes. It is extremely difficult to marry the threads of humour and tragedy. Dark humour, in my view, is the hardest to write and play well - and I am afraid that nobody here really carries it off with much distinction. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but I didn't hear anyone else in the cinema laughing either. Not for me, sorry.", "I guess Kevin Smith is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nBut, as the Dark Knight pointed out \"you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" I guess Smith live long enough.\r\n\r\nChasing Amy was always my favorite, but Clerks and Mall Rats were classics, Clerks II was pretty hysterical, Dogma (especially if you are Catholic like me) is absolutely cutting and brilliantly so. Jay and Silent Bob... to much of the side characters, but at the end of the day they all had something in common...\r\n\r\n... they all cut into fandoms in only the way that fans, legit come to the comic book store every Wednesday, know what Diamond Distribution is fans of geek fandoms can completely and hysterically criticize the things they love.\r\n\r\nHe even cut into the original Star Wars. It was Geek Counter Culture and we loved every minute of it.\r\n\r\nClerks III has NONE OF THAT. Smith used to criticize pop culture, and now that he's part of it, his scripts don't work. They lost their edge. The brilliance of his early work has faded to the land of sell outs.\r\n\r\nNow you are more likely to see him weep over a bad Star Wars movie in an obvious shill than you are to see him make jokes about how many innocent construction workers died in the second Death Star.\r\n\r\nAnd when he stopped being able to take apart fandom's and playfully make jabs at them, when he stopped criticizing pop culture and started to shill for it, he became irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to watch Clerks III, everything that made the first two... that made most of his early work great is absent in this on.", "**A worthy end to a franchise that took a while to captivate my interest.**\r\n\r\nI didn't like the first film very much, as I even mentioned in the text I wrote for it. However, I was able to enjoy the sequel, and although this film is not as good as it is, it ends up being able to give a decent ending to the trilogy: Dante and Randal continue to run their shop, and both are haunted by heart diseases, the result of of the bad life habits they had. After recovering from a heart problem, Randal decides to make an autobiographical film based on his professional experience.\r\n\r\nThe movie was specially thought for Clerks fans. There is no concern about attracting new audiences or pleasing the general public, it is felt from the beginning that it is a film designed to close a larger work, not to give it continuity. The greatest proof of this turns out to be the omnipresence of metaphysical themes, such as illness, religion, death and what happens after it. The characters are the same as usual, and the film even has some special appearances (as had been customary in previous films), and there is nothing surprising in what they do or say.\r\n\r\nThe cast remains the same, with Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson pontificating and dominating everything with a remarkable job, very well done. Next to them are Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, who have an important part in the most hilarious scenes. And although Rosario Dawson has a good capacity and talent for comedy, her character takes on a much more dramatic and profound facet here, which gave the film greater emotion.", "I tend to like movies with less action and more introspection and more \u201ctalkative.\u201d Still, since I had read the book on this and saw other reports, I wondered if this might all seem like old news when I watched it. But I found out to be enthralling. I engaged with the lead characters and appreciated the excellent work of the secondary characters. For example, a quiet but strong portrayal of the partner of one of the reporters who seemed to be a reporter in his own right but who was supportive of her efforts.\r\n\r\nI felt they didn\u2019t go for the melodramatic approach here as they well might have. They merely hinted about moments like one of them wondering if a car occupant was watching her, and used just one threatening phone call when they probably actually had many of them. It kept the story cleaner and moving forward.\r\n\r\nShe Said reminded me of All the Presidents Men, with the two investigative reporters being held to a standard of having sufficient sources to back up their reporting but where Woodward and Bernstein seemed mostly concerned with holding people accountable for their illegal actions, the journalists in she Said connected and formed a personal bond with the victims they located and encouraged to speak out.", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\nImportant subject matter doesn\u2019t always translate to a good movie, and \u201cShe Said\u201d is a botched attempt at retelling the true story of two New York Times reporters who took down the infamous Hollywood abuser, Harvey Weinstein. It\u2019s something with which the industry is very familiar, and the years of sexual misconduct that the two women uncovered is horrifying. It was one of the most important articles to ever run in the newspaper, but this story would be better suited to the page and not the screen.\r\n\r\nThe film follows writers Megan Twohey (Carey Mulligan) and Jodi Kantor (Zoe Kazan) as they investigate the Miramax movie mogul, trying repeatedly to get big name actresses to go on the record to expose Weinstein\u2019s gross abuse of power. Instead of offering new insight, director Maria Schrader uses the same old newsroom clich\u00e9s to create a pedestrian investigative journalism film. It\u2019s procedural, boring, and repetitive, with a series of scenes featuring the two leads making phone calls, writing or reading text messages, and sitting in editorial meetings. Of course, this is less than interesting because the story isn\u2019t cinematic: it\u2019s dull.\r\n\r\nThe film touches on the more interesting aspects of working as a woman in Hollywood, as many of Weinstein\u2019s victims refused to be named on the record because they were terrified they\u2019d never work again. This did happen more often than not, and he either bought or forced their silence. Perhaps if screenwriter Rebecca Lenkiewicz had decided to focus more on the personal dilemmas and fallout his victims faced rather than only briefly touch on them, this would have been a stronger and more powerful movie.\r\n\r\nEven worse, the film doesn\u2019t feel timely. The decision to tell this story now seems dated and past its expiration date. Women will always remember the #MeToo movement and it will go down in history as one of the most important feminist campaigns of the 2000s, but many of us would rather forget about Weinstein while he rots away in jail.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s where my biggest problem with the film comes in: the story leaves a really bad taste in my mouth, especially when you stop to realize that many of Weinstein\u2019s employees, friends, and peers either aided in covering up his crimes or even worse, willfully looked the other way. Harvey\u2019s touchy nature and treatment of subordinates was the worst kept secret in Hollywood circles. He was as creep, and many who met him were uncomfortable being in his presence. It feels a bit disingenuous (or perhaps just a bit ironic) to make a movie about it, even if the story\u2019s focus is on the two reporters.\r\n\r\nThe better parts of the narrative inspire with the proof of the power of journalism to encourage change, and Kantor and Twohey absolutely played a huge part in giving women who were victimized the courage to come forward. Mulligan gives a strong performance, but it\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t have an equally robust script to work with. Both of the leads feel wasted, especially when they are called on to do little more than rattle off facts and name-drop big actresses who came forward to expose the year of abusive behavior by Weinstein. None of this is a substitute for compelling drama, and \u201cShe Said\u201d fades into the void of forgettable procedural journalism films.", "The story was good, but acting was bad and the devastating part of this movie was horrible CGI. Such CGI in 2022 isn't acceptable.", "the only \"terror that surfaced\" was the ACTING!", "**The Requin falls victim to its extremely annoying lead and a budget that apparently couldn\u2019t afford water in its shark movie.**\r\n\r\nHaving an actress with some big-screen films on her resume would help The Requin rise above its cheesy shark movie competition, but it most definitely did not. In fact, the lead character of this movie was the worse part! Her frantic screams, frustrated outbursts, and emotional moments made the typical c-list shark movie actors look much better. It is shocking how annoying her performance was. On top of that, the green screen was very noticeable and overused, making me wonder how much water even made it into this movie. I am surprised that this director also made The Princess, which was a well-done, fun action movie. What happened to this movie, then? The Requin isn\u2019t just a bad movie; it is bad for a bad shark movie! Don\u2019t waste your time.", "Redeeming Love looks great. It features great locations shot with great cinematography, but that\u2019s about all director D.J. Caruso can do to entice us to keep watching. It\u2019s terrific to see a story unfolding in a non-CGI, true-to-life setting, even if it\u2019s Cape Town standing in for California (but then some of the greatest westerns were filmed in Europe, so there\u2019s that), but while this movie arguably achieves the western look, it fails to conjure up any sort of western feel.\r\n\r\nThe script concerns a Hooker with a Heart of Gold known as Angel, who is so sought after that the local Madame, who calls herself Duchess, holds a daily raffle to determine which lucky slack-jawed gold miners \u2013 there is more than one winner per day \u2013 get to hold sexual congress with her. This is such a cumbersome arrangement that it actually gets in the way of the plot, so that co-writers Francine Rivers and Caruso Hand Wave it not long after they have introduced it.\r\n\r\nSo-called \u201cdirt farmer\u201d Michael Hosea becomes smitten with Angel, so what does he do to get near her? Does he buy all the numbers in the raffle? Does he have the raffle rigged? No and no; he simply \u201cpays double\u201d. That\u2019s it. Why this hasn\u2019t occurred to at least some of the yokels who form a daily scrum outside the brothel is anybody\u2019s guess. Another good question is where Michael, who is not a miner, finds enough \u201cgold dust\u201d to gain access to Angel on three different occasions.\r\n\r\nAngel wants nothing to do with Michael owing to a deep-seated hatred and distrust of men, which is established in a series of flashbacks that are so many and so long they could make up an entire, separate movie all by themselves. They are also the reason that Redeeming Love unnecessarily breaks the 120-minute mark. But the oddest part about these flashbacks is that they show Angel escaping a life of compulsory whoredom only to enter a life of voluntary whoredom. Twice. Maybe even thrice, but that last time is once again against her will. In any case, it gets to be quite repetitive after a while.\r\n\r\nIt is only after Angel gets the tar beaten out of her by the Duchess\u2019s lackey Magowan that she relents and agrees to marry Michael \u2013 but first he has to pay off her \u201cdebt\u201d to the Duchess, and the irony that he literally buys Angel off in order to make an honest woman out of her is lost on Michael and Caruso alike.\r\n\r\nRedeeming Love\u2019s greatest achievement, other than its photography, is how well it masks its biblical pedigree. According to Wikipedia this is a \u201cChristian Western\u201d based on an homonymous novel by Rivers (unread by me, though it wouldn\u2019t surprise if she had first published it under the pseudonym F.R. Ancine), which in turn is inspired by an obscure Old Testament book \u2013 not that you would even guess at any of this by watching the movie, and that\u2019s actually a good thing. It may be long and boring, but at least it\u2019s not overtly preachy.", "_Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery_ is a lighthearted murder mystery filled with effective comedy, fantastic performances, and a somewhat predictable plot.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a great time with this film and the theater experience was one of my favorites of the year. The plot is somewhat similar to the first, a murder happens and Benolt Blanc is there to solve it. It hits all the familiar beats but does not work quite as well as its predecessor, this is mainly due to the characters. The performances were great and they work well in isolation from the overarching story, but all of them are such over-the-top caricatures that are hard to believe their connections or motivations to kill. Their banter with each other is charming and funny and helps carry this movie forward.\r\n\r\nThe first quarter of this movie was pretty poorly done. A lot of the setup had pandemic references and humor that felt really out of place in 2022. So many movies before this have touched on those topics that it felt overdone and boring. Really interesting choice for this type of film, but once the characters get to the island all of that awkward setup is left on the mainland and the movie starts to find its footing.\r\n\r\nFrom this point forward, I had a great time. Daniel Craig was fantastic as Benolt Blanc and it was quite funny to see him as a fish out of water surrounded by corporate elites. The majority of the lines I laughed at were delivered by him with a dry pan sense of delivery. It was organic and played well on screen. Edward Norton was a fantastic addition and the majority of the cast did excellently. They were really funny and delivered the stereotyped character performances well.\r\n\r\nMuch like the beginning of the movie, the last ten minutes did not work tremendously well for me. It was quite corny, over the top, and unrealistic. It diminishes the greatness of the middle of the film.\r\n\r\nEven though this movie fails to reach the heights of the original, it does enough to deliver a very entertaining mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed. It is a shame that Netflix is only having a limited release for this film because it is best in a crowded theater on the silver screen.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _77%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Great_", "MORE SPOILER-FREE MINI-REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/mini-reviews-2022-edition/\r\n\r\n\"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery would never disappoint.

Exceptional performances from a shockingly talented cast - Daniel Craig and Janelle Mon\u00e1e are the standouts - elevate a screenplay slightly lacking in character depth as well as better control over its clear yet repetitive message concerning opportunism, vanity, and hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nOriginal remains supreme, but this sequel deserved a worldwide premiere on the big screen.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "Brilliant!\r\n\r\nMy first film of 2023, which has started with a bang!

I did, admittedly, predict the general gist of what was going to happen, though (in this case, minor) predictability doesn't always equel badness - like here, I was thoroughly entertained no matter what.\r\n\r\nThe cast from the first film are better, though those that star in this 2022 release are excellent. Daniel Craig is, of course, superb as Benoit Blanc once again, every single moment with him is terrific. Janelle Mon\u00e1e also gives a fantastic performance, I predominantly know of her from music but with this, and <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hidden-figures/\">Hidden Figures</a>'</em>, she can certainly act too.\r\n\r\nKate Hudson, Dave Bautista and Edward Norton are the best of the others, though even the likes of Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr. and Madelyn Cline are good value as well. Like its predecessor, it's very astutely cast.\r\n\r\nThe film is put together in high quality fashion, Rian Johnson & Co. did a great job - particularly with the framing of certain shots, as well as the music which is real neat.

There were a few interesting plot twists and, even though the dialogue could have been more witty, it was intelligent and realistic.\r\n\r\nI did find that the Renoir character reminded me of an Agatha Christie character, in that he reeled off suppositions he\u2019d made based on information we hadn\u2019t been given full access to. Also, he owed some of his success to a character who he asked to take a snoop around, and she proceeded to be in several spots just in time to hear critical details. Pretty lucky. Then again.

Secondly, yes it presents us with a group of stars with beautiful charisma on the screen.\r\n\r\nThis time, the events of the film take place during the pandemic. This time, the main investigator, the hero of the story, is facing deadly boredom due to him staying at home all the time due to the pandemic and the lockdown. This is what drives him, without hesitation, to participate in one of the games organized by a rich person. This game is to solve a crime, hypothetically a crime that didn't happen in reality. This invitation reaches the investigator and some close friends of this rich person, but during their arrival to the place of the invitation, we begin to discover many mysterious things.\r\n\r\nThe first is how the friends get to know each other. Each character is completely different from the other character, a rich person, a YouTuber model, a scientist, in addition to a political figure and an investigator. We begin to discover, by starting the conversation from the beginning, that there is a suspicious or unhealthy past for each character, but the most important thing is that it is far from the game and the hypothetical investigation. We begin to discover real crimes in the place of Al-Daghwa, and now everyone is a suspect, and through the story we will learn who the culprit is.\r\n\r\nYes, I am almost certain that the characters of the second part will continue on the same path as the movie of the first part. What I did not like about this movie. Yes, they showed us the motives and reasons, but I could not get behind any motive in them, and in these types of stories, the most beautiful thing is that it shows that you made a mistake about who the murderer is, not Only in deceiving you, but showing you that your deductions were wrong, makes you doubt one or two or three people, and in the end you discover that all your doubts were wrong. In this part, I was not able to doubt anyone.\r\n\r\nYes, it is true, there are many good plots in the scenario, and there is good manipulation, but I cannot be certain that I doubt any character, as if I was waiting and seeing the events for the vision to appear. I could not participate in the game, which is very important in this type of movie. In addition to clarifying things, there were many coincidences to the point of being so ridiculous. The only reason some mysteries and some indicators were discovered is that the character, for some reason, was present at the right time and the right place without any actual intelligence to find the information.\r\n\r\nI don't know. I feel that my feelings were confused towards the end of the movie. I would almost describe it as childish ending. the actions of some characters led to the flattening of this movie.

After a brief exploration of the place, they find themselves at the mercy of a board game that requires their undivided attention else a crossbow will put paid to each of them. Initially they are all petrified - especially as two of their number take fairly early exits (perhaps they'd read the whole script?) - but gradually they realise that team work might be their only hope of salvation. What now ensues is just a mess. It contrives to include just about every stereotypical character known to man in what seems like an overlong hundred minutes of attitude that really just fell flat. After about twenty minutes I was merrily supporting the would be killer who just couldn't mow down this lot fast enough. There's a bit of a twist at the end which might have worked better had I cared in the slightest about their survival, but even that seemed engineered only to create something that, horrifyingly, suggested that a sequel might be in the back of someone's mind!

This sense of despair soon leads to horror as the plot progresses, creating some uncomfortable moments for both our main character and the audience. Overall, there is just something about this movie that is able to hook me. I had many laughs mixed while feeling completely heartbroken for Padriac.

I understand why some people might not fully appreciate the story (which reminds me of Aronofsky's Black Swan in that it's a painfully slow descent into Hell). I find this film as complex as a fine scotch, or a fine wine. The top note is, of course, the beautiful visuals created by Ben Davis. The acting all around is phenomenal. Farrell and Gleeson were, of course, nothing short of spectacular. The real surprise was the character created by Barry Keoghan. I couldn't help but be amazed by how real his character was. Although I was expecting the banshees to be like in the horror film I saw as a kid, I really appreciated the Shakespearean witch device. It was perfect in this context. The second note of flavor of this masterpiece is all about relationships in a closed community. If you ever lived in a condo, an association community or the like, you will recognize the day-to-day pettiness that everyone thinks is so important. A subtle addition to the complex layers of flavor is Burwell's perfect score. And the deep flavor of this movie? It is the parallel that the protagonists finally draw to the meaninglessness of the Civil War that rages on the mainland. If two people within a single tribe cannot make a peace, how is this poor world ever going to live?", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n_This film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival_\r\n\r\nWriter and director Martin McDonagh is no stranger to creating stories that find humor in darkness. In fact, it\u2019s arguably what he does best. With his latest film \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin,\u201d McDonagh captures the sadness of a breakup between two longtime friends with his signature darkly comedic, cynical tone. It\u2019s an emotional character study about loneliness and isolation that expertly blends humor and cruelty, and it\u2019s one of my favorite films so far this year.\r\n\r\nSet on a fictional remote island during the Irish Civil War of 1922, the film tells the story of buddies P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson), two men who find themselves at an impasse. It all starts one day when Colm unexpectedly and abruptly decides to end their friendship, offering no explanation and leaving his former pal stunned and saddened. With the help of his sister Siobh\u00e1n (Kerry Condon) and the troubled islander Dominic (Barry Keoghan), P\u00e1draic plans to do whatever it takes to repair the estranged relationship. His repeated efforts to reconcile annoy Colm to the point that he delivers a shocking ultimatum, which in turn escalates the petty feud to an alarming standoff that could have violent consequences.\r\n\r\nWorking from an outline of a sad breakup, McDonagh\u2019s script flows with a natural rhythm that\u2019s brimming with sharp wit and wry, dark humor. This isn\u2019t a complex narrative, but the dialogue is impassioned and poignant with a genuine understanding of the human condition. McDonagh\u2019s writing is like no other, with a natural talent that\u2019s enviable. The script plays directly to the specific strengths of his cast, too.\r\n\r\nFeaturing Oscar-caliber performances, Gleeson and Farrell strike the perfect harmony as Colm and P\u00e1draic. Their rapport is natural and relaxed, and there\u2019s a comfortable feeling between the two actors which no doubt stems from being reunited with McDonagh. This trio should continue to make movies together because something magical happens when they do. Condon and Keoghan are also excellent in this story of conflicts, as Siobh\u00e1n grapples with the realization that she may risk dying from an unhappy and unfulfilled life if she continues resisting her her urge to flee, and Dominic must deal with the mental suffering of being worn down by his abusive policeman father.\r\n\r\nThe strongest supporting turns come from the scene-stealing animal actors, who represent loyalty and unconditional friendship in a story that\u2019s peppered with a dark undercurrent. Even as the humans around them struggle with their worlds falling apart (and a civil war raging nearby), their equine and canine companions keep them grounded. One of the most memorable scenes features a touching moment between a miniature donkey and a horse, and it is one that absolutely destroyed me. It\u2019s moments like these that add up to a fiercely affective film that is adept at delivering a highly emotional experience to the audience.\r\n\r\nNot only is McDonagh an effective writer, but he is also a talented director with a knack for capturing and creating a mood. Working in tandem with his cinematographer Ben Davis, the film is filled with stunning photography and astonishingly gorgeous scenery of coastal Ireland. These desolate landscapes lend a natural beauty that in turn creates a strong sense of place, providing the perfect backdrop for the story.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin\u201d is an example of that increasingly rare instance where a film fully and completely achieves its desired effect. Backed by two of the finest performances of the year and a superbly written script, this is a piece of accomplished, outstanding filmmaking.", "_Memory_ juggles so many subplots to unsatisfactory results. It\u2019s as if the story throws a ball in the air for every concept in the film (Alzheimer\u2019s, human trafficking, the FBI vs the police, rich people getting whatever they want, etc) only to allow each ball to smack against the ground without trying to catch them after their initial toss. For a film about a guy who kills people with the authorities chasing him for nearly two hours, _Memory_ is a monotonous bore. Not even Liam Neeson lighting himself on fire to cauterize a bullet wound can save what is otherwise a forgetful and fatigued memoir of a hoary hit man.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Memory-2022-Review-A-Forgetful-and-Fatigued-Memoir-of-a-Hoary-Hit-Man", "**Memory isn't terrible, but it's a little too slow for an action thriller and isn't edgy enough for a crime thriller.

Non-Stop, The Commuter, and The Grey were all solid films, too, but let's face it\u2026 he isn't getting any younger, so his action movies are slowing in pace. Memory was smart enough to incorporate that into the script while still having Neeson kick some butt. This movie is an improvement over some of his recent stuff like the Marksman (and, from what I hear, Blacklight), but I sure do miss the days of Taken or Kingdom of Heaven. My hopes were higher with Martin Campbell directing, but I spent most of the movie looking at my phone. It's not terrible, but it needed to be a little darker and more menacing to hold my attention. In the end, you won't care to remember much about Memory. Neeson is still the man, though!", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/violent-night-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Violent Night is one of the biggest surprises of the year, instantly becoming a contemporary Christmas classic! David Harbour expertly embodies a shockingly brutal, savage version of Santa Claus that somehow still delivers lovely messages.\r\n\r\nFighting sequences feature truly violent practical stunts, taking advantage of the R rating to provide unmeasurable amounts of gore. Creative use of Christmas songs will leave audiences crying with laughter.\r\n\r\nA brilliant homage to the seasonal genre classics that should be seen in a packed theater!\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "Yeah I'm going to give this top marks, not because it is really that good, but because it came out in 2022 and was probably the best thing in the theater at the time (which was probably why the other Movie Data Base started deleting positive reviews of it).  \r\n\r\nBut a lot of it is done right, it features an interracial family but doesn't make the race a key part of the story.  In fact, it doesn't even mention it at all.  Instead it follows the story of a little girl and Santa. \r\n\r\nAnd the Santa is a bit weird, there is a lot of things that just don't fit with his character, but that doesn't matter because the story is just so fun that you willingly suspend most of your disbelief.\r\n\r\nIt is violent and does a great job of making the violence both exciting and at times comical.  It drops Easter eggs in some of the best possible ways.  Not all the men are evil and idiotic and not all the women are practically perfect in every way.  They are just written as, well, as unique characters.\r\n\r\nAnd you really have to appreciate it in 2022 when most movies drop characters for checked boxes.  \r\n\r\nIt was probably the only movie that you could go into in 2022 and just be entertained by.  That was the clear intent in making this and that was the end result.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago it would have been \"Meh\" but in 2022 it is the best thing in theaters.", "A well done flick, I'd say.\r\n\r\nI didn't even know this existed until I was invited a week or two back to go watch it, which is a surprise as I'd imagine a Whitney Houston biopic would've got enough hype that I would've seen it mentioned around the web - perhaps I just happened to miss it? Either way, I'd very much recommend <em>'Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody'</em>.\r\n\r\nI'm no Houston brainiac but of course knew of her top songs and unfortunate personal issues, I feel like the film does a commendable job at covering all aspects - the pacing is top notch, in my opinion. I'd imagine it takes liberties with the truth, as per for this genre, here and there, but that doesn't bother me much if so.\r\n\r\nNaomi Ackie is terrific in the lead role, quite the first performance of her's to watch on my part. I hope to see more! The rest of the cast, from Stanley Tucci to Ashton Sanders to Tamara Tunie to Nafessa Williams to Clarke Peters, particularly the latter, are also very good throughout.\r\n\r\nI found the run time to be spot on, while the music is - as you'd expect - excellent. Houston sure did make a tonne of hits!", "Such a blast!\r\n\r\nPersonally, I wasn't expecting much from <em>'Bullet Train'</em> at all. The (most overplayed) trailer didn't fill with me with much interest and I thought the bullet train aspect would be gimmicky and perhaps even too limiting. However, to my surprise it's the exact opposite to all that. It's supremely entertaining and very amusing!\r\n\r\nI love the whole style of the film, the editing is top notch. the bloody visuals are class and the music is superbly chosen - every track hits. Then you also have an excellent cast. I thought, again based on the trailer(s) that I saw, it would be a run-of-the-mill Brad Pitt feature, but his performance is terrific throughout.\r\n\r\nAaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry are a quality double act, I thought their accents and dynamic would get tiresome but if anything I enjoyed them the more I saw them - funny guys! Joey King was the only character I wasn't sold on during the film, though by the end I dug her performance too.\r\n\r\nAndrew Koji and Hiroyuki Sanada are also very good, while Michael Shannon, Benito A. Mart\u00ednez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) and Zazie Beetz are welcomed cast members as well. There are also a few other noteworthy people involved, including two that Pitt knows well from a different <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-city-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2022 flick</a>. Seriously, what a cast!\r\n\r\nIf I had to mention one gripe, it would be the run time/pacing - this is me nit-picking, though at like one or two (no more than that) moments I did feel like it wasn't paced incredibly. Again, no biggie though. All in all, I most definitely had a great time with this and would certainly recommend it.*\r\n\r\n*still, if you want an even greater film set entirely on a train then you gotta check out the outstanding <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/source-code/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source Code</a>'</em> - one of my favourites!", "A well-timed, funny, action packed train ride, I was not bored for a single second of this film.", "This was a fund movie indeed, and quite woke-free at that. The fact that the woke crap site Rotten Tomatoes has marked it as rotten (despite it having more than 50% positive critics reviews) was a good sign of course.\r\n\r\nIt is an action/comedy about an unbelievably unlucky (and a bit stupid) assassin played by Brad Pitt. The movie mixes action, comedy, a bit of suspense and a fair amount of gore in a quite enjoyable package.\r\n\r\nThe movie balances the comedy bits right on the line where it would turn silly and cringe-worthy but there was really only one place where I went \u201cOh no, what the f\u2026?\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe action bits are overall quite good but this is Hollywood with their armada of clueless script writers so sometimes they get a bit ridiculous. Like being able to hang on to the outside of a bullet train while it speeds away.\r\n\r\nAlthough fairly unbelievable and over the top, the core story actually makes some sense but then, it was not written by some Hollywood hack but instead based on a novel.\r\n\r\nOverall it was a fun movie with a lot of laughs. The end twist with the tangerine truck was absolutely hilarious.", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\nIt takes a lot for a film to surprise me, and I love it when one does. \u201cBullet Train\u201d is chocked full of so much stylish, bloody, violent fun that it reminds me why I love movies in the first place. Director David Leitch brings a confident, creative vision to his Guy Ritchie-meets-Gareth Evans-meets Matthew Vaughn-meets Quentin Tarantino style that\u2019s rambunctious, frenzied, and in your face. While some will detest this sort of mayhem, many fans of the genre will join me in enthusiastically screaming, \u201cshoot this into my veins!\u201c\r\n\r\nUnlucky assassin Ladybug (Brad Pitt) is tired of the brutality. He\u2019s back for another job, but has pledged to work peacefully and without a weapon. Ladybug has been tasked with retrieving a silver briefcase from a high-speed train in Japan, which seems simple enough. Fate steps in, naturally, putting a damper on his well-intentioned plans. The train is filled with the most lethal adversaries (and one deadly snake) from around the globe, and they all want the same thing. Chaos ensues in what may be a literal last man standing scenario.\r\n\r\nBased on the book by K\u00f4tar\u00f4 Isaka, the film takes place almost solely onboard a train, but it never feels claustrophobic. Despite tight close-ups and many dialogue-heavy scenes with questionable writing, the cast (including Joey King, Andrew Koji, Michael Shannon, and Hiroyuki Sanada) keeps things engaging. Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a pair of professional criminals are particularly entertaining, and Pitt exercises his movie star chops with great aplomb. The storytelling is terrific (one of my favorite bits is the tale of Wolf, which is wonderfully executed), even if everything doesn\u2019t quite come together as well as it could.\r\n\r\nThis is also a gorgeous looking film. Jonathan Sela\u2018s colorful cinematography is alluring, with a richness that elevates every scene. Leitch is skilled at directing action scenes that are thrilling, and fights that are well choreographed. Even the CGI is exciting.\r\n\r\nThe film reaches just the right balance between action, violence, and humor, and it\u2019s one that I cannot wait to revisit. From the killer soundtrack to the rapid-fire visual storytelling, there\u2019s a lot going on at all times. If you\u2019re not paying attention, you\u2019re guaranteed to miss something. I feel this one could benefit from subsequent viewings. Plus, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve wanted to rush back to re-watch a movie the second it ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cBullet Train\u201d is a film that will prove to be an acquired taste. It\u2019s the type of movie that you\u2019ll either love or loathe, with very few landing somewhere in between. It\u2019s illogical, confrontational, and it\u2019s sometimes evident that the film trying too hard, but I found it easy to overlook the flaws because it\u2019s just so damn entertaining. Talk about a nonstop thrill ride.", "_The Invitation_ started off so well, but eventually morphed into a generic film that I could have predicted from a mile away. The set up to the movie was decent, but the second act was when I really thought this movie nailed it. I really enjoyed the somewhat sadistic back and forth between the two leads. On one hand, you see a woman ready to give herself over to the thought of love for the first time. While on the other hand, the audience knows this chance at love is built on a lie. Despite this fact, I found the chemistry incredibly strong between the two leads. I was smiling as their love story progressed, even though I knew it was not going to end well. Nathalie Emmanuel and Thomas Doherty do such an excellent job in this film. I loved their chemistry and Dohery does such a great Jekyll and Hyde with the unearthly vampire masked by the charismatic lord. Super entertaining watching them do great work here.\r\n\r\nThe creepy disturbing nature of the trailers was not overly present here, almost all of the unsettling imagery was used for the trailers and leaves the rest of the movie feeling pretty generic. This is even more evident when the movie turns into a vampire action flick reminiscent of the Twilight movies. At this moment, I was completely ripped out of the movie and was ready for it to end. This drastic change in tone really did not fit well here for me. Even though the last quarter was a disappointment, there is still good elements to the movie that is worth watching for those that were initially interested.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _55%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Average_", "This is just the gift that keeps on giving... Only thing is, once you take the admittedly attractive wrapping from the box, the present is empty! This continues the on/off, love/hate, familial discord of \"Tessa\" (Josephine Langford) and her beau \"Hardin\" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). The thrust here (and there is far less actual thrusting in this film than in the others) seems to be to prove that the young lovers are maturing; they are beginning to realise that they are more two peas in a pod than we might have originally considered. This also develops the roles of the parents - especially \"Trish\" (Louise Lombard) and \"Ken\" (Rob Estes) as we discover they have plenty of demons of their own, and so frankly it is no real wonder that the weans have grown up quite so dysfunctional. It is hard to know just quite who this film is for. The story is all over the place, the melodrama weak and implausible and the characterisations become less and less engaging as this tiresome and frankly rather boring franchise drags all of their unwanted dirty washing onto the screen. It is also quite difficult to know whom this is relevant too or for, and HFT is as wooden as a board throughout.

Suffice to say, he doesn't quite manage and next thing the whole load of them are in peril of their lives. This contains one of the daftest old age sex scenes I have ever seen, but that is all I found even vaguely memorable about this rather derivative film. Sure, it's got an hungry alligator but the ending is weak, and the characters just parodied everything crass from the tacky late 1970s adult entertainment industry in a really flat, sterile, fashion.

It is so interesting to be so emotionally connected to the killer but yet disturbed by the actions they take as well. I just cannot get over how good this movie is!

The filmmaker's lack of restraint may be a trigger for some, but the impact of his messages couldn't be more memorable.\r\n\r\nBring tissues.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "The Whale is a heart breaking story of our main character, Charlie (Brendon Fraser), as he tries to make amends for abandoning his daughter. Charlie is obese, an ailment that has manifested itself as a coping mechanism for a life of regret. In every scene and interaction this regret is worn by Charlie as a cloak of his past that will stay with him until his dying breath. This character is an immense undertaking and Brendon Fraser plays him perfectly. The emotion he delivers is palpable, which lends itself so seamlessly to scenes of raw sadness and despair. Not only is Fraser a highlight, but the entire supporting cast does an excellent job. Hong Chau is superb, and despite her tough, no nonsense, science focused exterior hides a deep and genuine connection with Charlie. She is incredibly hurt by the way he is treating his body, but is defenseless to his desires, resulting in her to continually feed his addiction. It is a brutal back and forth that is tackled with immense care. Sadie Sink is great as well, she is delivers a brutal performance that leaves the character of Ellie easily hatable with very little redeemable qualities. I understand that this was the point of her character, and by no means is this a knock on Sink's performance, but it felt like a bit much. She was too cruel, to the point of unbelievability, which took a bit away from the message that was trying to be delivered. The pace was a bit slow for my liking. I felt as if the Thomas subplot was a bit pointless and could have been cut from the movie with no ill effects. But despite my minor complaints, the movie is carried by fantastic performances, amazing cinematography and intense emotions that will leave many viewers pleased with their experience, but will not be for everyone.\r\n\r\nScore: 82%\r\nVerdict: Great", "I doubt I can add much more to what has already been said about <em>'The Whale'</em>, but in a word: Bravo!\r\n\r\nBrendan Fraser truly is sensational in this role. I heard about all the acclaim and seen a few of the standing ovations he has received and all I can say is that it is unequivocally deserved. Truly outstanding from the first scene (yes, even with that... ha) to the very last. It's great to see the dude that I first saw as a kid in <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/george-of-the-jungle/\">George of the Jungle</a>'</em> well and truly back in the game.\r\n\r\nOne thing about Fraser getting all the (undoubtedly merited) plaudits from this Darren Aronofsky flick is that I didn't know what to expect from the support cast, and man are there some absolutely stellar performances behind Fraser. Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton are top notch, though Hong Chau is a cut above that trio - brilliant stuff from her!\r\n\r\nThere are some powerful scenes in there. I'm not one to cry with fictional works (my brain automatically knows it's 'fake', I can't help it) but man even I got major goosebumps and gut punches (pardon the pun?) from what's portrayed onscreen. Fraser, and Chau, are naturally the major reasons for that, but everyone - on and off the screen - deserves big props for this 2022 film.\r\n\r\nThe definition of a must-watch.", "I like this one.\r\nIt really made me feel something.", "write something honest\r\n\r\nAny movie directed by Darren Aronofsky contains a lot of violent scenes that are unfamiliar and hard on the eyes to see. Darren Aronofsky is a director whose work must be eagerly awaited because one of his films, Requiem of Dream 2000, is one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nThe most important event in the movie The Whale is the star Brendan Fraser, after suffering from many health problems, especially with the spine, and was forced to perform surgeries, in addition to the withdrawal of lights and fame from him, and his playing movie roles that didn't achieve wide success.\r\n\r\nBrendan Fraser played a terrible role that deserves an Academy Award due to his genius performance, and you do not expect this wonderful acting performance from him, especially since he is an actor who is very good at comedy roles. He did a lot of dramatic work, but he didn't reach perfection like the one in the movie The Whale.\r\n\r\nThis amazing drama was like a oneman show although the other actors did well but the main reason for my admiration for the movie is Brendan Fraser. It was the make-up and the way the breathing was unbelievable and it's mind blowing how someone can pull off such a role\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in only one location, with the exception of the flashback scenes.

The finale is grossly manipulative, corny, excessive, and if what came before wasn\u2019t so great, it would diminish director Darren Aronofsky\u2019s entire project. Thanks to a heartbreaking script (from writer Samuel D. Hunter) and a once-in-a-lifetime lead performance from Brendan Fraser, it takes little effort to overlook the film\u2019s more negative aspects.\r\n\r\nBased on Hunter\u2019s 2012 play of the same name, the psychological drama tells the story of Charlie (Fraser), a reclusive English professor who is living with severe obesity. Weighing over 600 pounds and unable to leave his home, Charlie spends his days alone in his small, dingy apartment with intermittent visits from his friend and nurse Liz (Hong Chau), who is his only companion. It\u2019s been an interesting week for the man, as he\u2019s had two additional unexpected visitors: a religious missionary (Ty Simpkins) who is compelled to continue his visits, and Charlie\u2019s estranged and hostile teenager daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink). With his health in grave decline (he repeatedly refuses to seek care at a hospital), Charlie decides to do everything in his power to gain one last chance at redemption in his daughter\u2019s eyes, and every ounce of time he has left is spent reconnecting with her.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place in a confined space, and the lead character spends the majority of his time sitting on a sofa. This cramped setting feels suffocating, which in turn conveys the feelings that Charlie is also experiencing. This is a story about empathy, and it\u2019s admittedly challenging at first glance to feel a ton of compassion for Charlie no matter how accepting you may think you are or claim to be. His outward appearance is shocking and repellant, and it\u2019s part of human nature to look at him as if he were a freak show attraction. What\u2019s interesting about the film is that it digs deeper beneath Charlie\u2019s obesity and lets you into his heart. I was surprised to find by the end of the story just how much I had grown to care so deeply for him.\r\n\r\nFolks who have seen the film and are crying that it is \u201cfat shaming\u201d are missing the point. This isn\u2019t a story about humiliation or degradation, it\u2019s a film about actually seeing the person inside a repulsive exterior and giving them humanity. This is not a project that mocks obesity, as has so often (and sadly) been the case with many Hollywood films. This is a story with substantial and challenging themes about depression, mental illness, and addiction. In this case, Charlie has spent years self-medicating his despair and unhappiness with food, and is now suffering from an eating disorder that has raged out of control.\r\n\r\nNone of this would be so emotionally touching if not for Fraser\u2019s lead performance. He is impressive and outstanding as Charlie, and it\u2019s one of the greatest cinematic performances in years (and definitely of the actor\u2019s career). It\u2019s not the spectacle of the makeup or fat suit that makes him memorable: it\u2019s how Fraser thoroughly embodies Charlie with a deep, soulful pain in his eyes. His performance absolutely ripped my heart right out of my chest to the point where I found it difficult to breathe. He\u2019s _that_ good.\r\n\r\nWhile there\u2019s been so much talk about Fraser, Chau\u2019s performance is equally heartbreaking. Through her facial expressions and body language, you can see and feel the pain Charlie is causing Liz. Everyone is simply waiting for the man to die, and you\u2019re right there by Liz\u2019s side as she cares for her best friend in a final act of selfless affection. It\u2019s an agonizing thing to watch and experience, and Chau conveys her torment in an understated, poignant way.\r\n\r\nIf it sounds like this is a tough film to watch, I will assure you that it is. You won\u2019t leave the theater floating on air when it\u2019s over. This is an adult drama that will leave you in tears with its story of resentment, vulnerability, regret, and humanity.

The sound design is excellent, and the sinister feel really adds to the movie's overall mood. The acting is good, but nothing too spectacular. No performances really blew me away. However, the body horror in the movie is fantastic, and it had the hair on the back of my neck standing up. Even though I do think it is not entirely needed, I have to give props in that department.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the script is pretty dreadful. The message is very in your face, overly complex and did not work for me. It was quite a turn off too, as it seemed as though the director was trying to say all men were the same and were terrible human beings. I know it had deeper meaning than that, but that surface level message is undeniable. I mean honestly, every person she encounters is such a massive piece of shit, not one person would have held out a helping hand? \r\n\r\nSomething that did really bother me was that the movie starts off as a creative psychological horror, but takes a spin in the third act that divulges into body horror mixed with slasher elements, which really takes away from the intriguing first 45 minutes of the film.

( Set in a broken home ) and some early techniques at effects the film maker used to better his home movies.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d starts in the 1950\u2019s with Sammy Fabelman experiencing for the first time the magic of cinema with his parents. Slightly traumatised by the movie, particularly a train crash scene, it\u2019s from this emotional experience the first glimpses of becoming a film maker appear. Who of us that have delved into the arts ( film making, actors , singers , performers , etc ) didn\u2019t start off creating these types of home made replicas? \u00a0The idyllic family set up, with the ever growing confident and more adept young home movie maker, \u00a0becomes derailed when after editing his 8mm footage of a family camping trip he discovers all was not as he remembered. \u00a0The impact of what Sam discovers about his concert pianist mother and that fateful trip results in the eventual breakdown of his parents.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs the movie moves into the early 1960\u2019s and Spielberg\u2019s high school years \u201cThe Fabelmans\u201dtouches on religion, race issues and first love. Due to the impact of that fateful camping holiday and therefore following a hiatus of not wanting to make any further home movies, Sam is persuaded by his girlfriend to film the end of school year beach party get together. \u00a0The impact of Sam\u2019s return to film making is clearly visible after the graduation film he produced is shown at the school prom to great acclaim. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d is well documented as being a love letter to cinema but equally it is Spielberg\u2019s love letter to his family. This is the movies key fact, the acceptance of multiple things happening all at once. Vocation is driven by both fear and talent, loving relationships break down, and movies that appear simplistic are highly sophisticated. With an extremely satisfying ending \u201c The Fabelmans\u201d is a beautifully crafted work of art and remarkable insight into one of the most famous and influential directors Hollywood has ever produced", "First of all, let me say that I don't rate movies based on happy ending or bad ending. I rate them by their impact. If movie had an impact on you, if it affected you, this means movie was strong and achieved its goal, doesn't matter if it's a positive or negative impact. And Based on my criteria, this movie is 10/10! This movie actually traumatized me. I have seen a lot of horror movies, but this one affected me a lot, because unlike those paranormal movies about demons, devil and etc, this one is realistic, which means this what happened in this movie, might be happening in real somewhere. And when we - viewers watch movies, we feel for main characters and what I felt for them in this movie was very big pain. It left me very angry and whole night I had last scenes in my mind when I was lying in bed, because I was imagining what if I was in their place... I won't give you a spoiler, but be warned, if you're sensitive person and if you decide to watch it, it will traumatize you. It's a masterpiece, but with a very sad and bad ending.", "Let me start off by saying that I completely understand all of the hate this film is getting, and that's because for the first half of the film I hated it too. For too much of this film, a lot of the characters are just unlikable slobs . . . especially Mel Gibson's character of Bill Long. Also, the story plays out . . . well, it plays out terribly for the first half of the film. It wasn't until later in the film when Stuart Long decides to become a preacher that I was actually invested, and why's that? That's because Long was an absolute piece of trash that I didn't want to watch for the first half of the film. This does not go without saying that by the end I liked Stuart Long's character in the film, but I couldn't like him for the first half.\r\n\r\nThe film isn't precisely terrible, but it isn't good. The third act is solid, but everything in the first act is bad, and the second where Stu is transitioning is mediocre. This does not make for a good film. When the film is simply bad for the first two acts, it can't just make up for it with a good third act, which sucks because the third act was actually not too bad.\r\n\r\nThe entire path of redemption message is interesting, but we've seen it done before, and with much better characters to say the least, but of course, this isn't saying that the path to redemption is bad to watch, but it is still bland and has been done multiple times before.\r\n\r\nIt was nice to see Bill Long become a semi-decent human being at the end of the film, because he realizes he has to now actually care for his son, Stu, but it doesn't really redeem him as a character within the film's boundaries. Also, Bill's character is an absolute D-bag throughout most of the film, so it makes it extremely hard to like him as a character by the end of the film . . . but, boy, if seeing that final dance with his wife wasn't something. . . .\r\n\r\nForgiveness is really what's at the core of \"Father Stu\", but I've already covered that previously. What I'm trying to talk about here is how almost all the characters have something they want to be forgiven for. Bill & Kathleen Long do seem to regret their choices that brought them to this point in their lives, and it's clear that they regret whatever tore them apart. As for Stu, he wants to be forgiven for everything. He regrets just about everything he's done in his life up to this point. The sad part about it is: There's just too much that Stu's done for the audience to really forgive him completely, although it is terrible what happened to him.\r\n\r\nIn my eyes, \"Father Stu\" isn't absolutely terrible, and I do think that it's mediocre at best by the end of the day. The third act is very well done, but because of all the other stuff beforehand it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I think people should check this one out if they're interested, but other than that, just leave it be. Ultimately, \"Father Stu\" is a hard thumbs down for me.", "The downfall of a great conductor (conductress??) could have been an interesting topic. But \u2018T\u00c1R\u2019 is 2h38mins of leaving out major plot points and instead showing details in dreadful scenes that often don\u2019t lead anywhere. The viewer has to make all this up for themselves, such as whether T\u00e1r is victim or culprit. In a way, this is all quite well done. Unfortunately, the film is too boring and incomprehensible to care. \r\n\r\nThis being a film about conducting, I found Blanchett\u2019s conducting style ridiculous, though she was good otherwise. At least the Mahler 5 excerpts sounded wonderful, and so let\u2019s just conclude with that number as my rating.\r\n\r\n5/10", "Another yawn-inducing direct-to-video action-thriller that takes place a month after the first film. Has yet another emotion-less \"performance\" from Bruce Willis who spends a good amount of time resting on a bed. The action is pretty inept and dialogue absolutely awful. The best thing is at least Chad Michael Murray was giving what I would call an \"aw f it\" performance. Otherwise this is as just as bland and forgettable as the first movie. **1.5/5**", "\r\n\r\nSisu is a Finnish film, not from Quentin Tarantino but certainly cut from the same variety of gruesome cloth. The film is visceral and over the top, celebrating slaughter, in a variety of horrifically novel, ways. \r\n\r\nI personally found the whole affair gratuitous, to be honest. What dwelt at the back of my mind and I feel should be remembered, is war is not a joke or a carnival. \r\n\r\nI grew up surrounded by people who lived and in some cases, served during WWII. The few tales they told were sad, often tragic and spoke of people trapped into a reality, not of their making or their wanting.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, Sisu is well paced, exposition driven and has lots of variety in its action. Acting is solid but exposition, is really this flicks, true driver. On a certain level too, this film, recalls spaghetti Westerns, with a WWII, make over. \r\n\r\nIn summary, if you like splatter style films, you'll probably like this, Just keep in mind, real people lived and died in WWII, on both sides. War is not a game, its not an entertainment.", "The movie is all action but without special computer effects (at least none that are over the top like almost all Hollywood movies in last decade). It's all killing and blood with some unrealistic scenes but still a lot better than Hollywood stuff of last decade. No woke stuff here. Definitely worth watching for hour and a half of entertainment without political or social propaganda.", "This is gourmet action food. If you think Marvel heroes are great, they pale compared to this guy. Or, if you just like watching Nazis get the living shit beat out of them, (I know I do) this is the film to watch. Or maybe you just want to see raped women get empowered for revenge. Sisu has all that. And it's bloody.\r\n\r\nI also love words that have no direct translation to English, like the Portuguese word soldade, or the German Schadenfreude. Now I've learned another, the Finnish word Sisu: A white-knuckled courage and unimaginable determination.", "Living in a small town of retarded drunks who take a dislike to me for petty, subconscious reasons is probably my worst nightmare.

I had a really good time with the film, Aubrey Plaza is fantastic as the lead, she carried this movie and made it an absolute treat to watch. The story hits on a lot of elements that the resonant with millennials while exploring them in a way that feels genuine. The plot is pretty good, although the main story points are almost all revealed in the trailers, which was a bit disappointing. There were times where I was having a hard time believing she could continue to get away with all the illegal activity she was getting up to without even raising suspicion, but I was able to turn my mind off and still have a solid experience.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _75%_ \r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_\r\n\r\n**Theater Verdict:** _See It_", "**Emily the Criminal's intriguing story and committed performance from Aubrey Plaza brought great high notes, but slow sections and a sad conclusion added some low notes.**\r\n\r\nEmily the Criminal chronicles a woman's impossible struggle to find work and survive with the insurmountable burden of her criminal record standing in the way. Eventually, honest employment seems impossible, so she turns to a more lucrative but more illegal method of income. Her path to success in the credit card fraud racket was interesting, with all the dangers of her new work and the pressure of avoiding getting caught. Unfortunately, the plot's pacing ebbed and flowed between long sections of an engaging and exciting story and long sections of slower, less interesting content. The title's meaning transformed as the movie progressed and the characters developed, but the final moments just saddened me. The character growth came at the expense of others and kept me from being able to cheer for where everything ended.", "**might contain spoilers**\r\n\r\nWhat a great murder mystery film. As an amateur climber, I too was initially put off by the amount of unprofessional climbing techniques. However, if they were truly climbing/solo enthusiasts, how could they not get injured way before they take on any big challenges? (And from a filmmaking perspective, with climbing being such a popular sports, surly it is not hard to get some random joe from the gym to tell the film crew that those techniques are horrible! also there are other suspicious common-sense defying points later\u2026) The answer of course, what we watched is just simply a **recounting of Becky\u2019s version of what transpired!!!** Then all the inaccuracies makes perfect sense as that\u2019s how you get the authorities to believe why the \u201caccidents\u201d happened in the first place \u2014 sheer negligence and amateur skills!\r\n\r\nI believe what happened was that Becky found out that she was cheated on, then plotted to get rid of the asshat by either screwing with the cam placements and/or - as filmed but with a malignant intent - to get rid of the rope too liberally. And no one else knows exactly how good the cam placements are or whether they were tempered with - Hunter is way above them busy down-climbing!\r\n\r\nThen, this explains perfectly her year-long depression as even if not fully planned out, her imo premeditated actions naturally put herself in even deeper sense of guilt.\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the forever unknowable fact that whether the tower trips is truly initiated by Hunter. Possibly Becky saw Hunter is living a guilt-free life and had another urge for murder and proposed to feed Hunter this great youtube/instagram clickbait trip to convince her to come along! Although the film depicts that Hunter is very heartwarming at times, it\u2019s entirely plausible that Hunter **is** in fact the care-free personality that she demonstrates in **all her videos online!** (which might makes her more murderable in Becky\u2019s eye). So Becky could be using a very high-IQ way of framing her victims as compassionate sweethearts.\r\n\r\nFinally, the biggest telltale sign that the final accident is premeditated (and possibly intended by the filmcrew/writer) is that when Becky lastly went for Hunter\u2019s body to drop down the phone, she **instinctively \u2014 rightfully so for a climber** clipped the carabiner to the lowest stable point which is the as yet unbroken ladder!!!(and the film gave this a real good close-up) Why on earth wouldn\u2019t Hunter do that when she went down to retrieve the bag???!!! This is not just bad climbing, this defies common sense! We were all screaming how stupid it was of Hunter to do what she did in the bag sequence and now we know, **these are all extremely likely fabrications recounted by Becky at the end of the accident!**\r\n\r\nLastly, some keen chinese filmgoers also noted the \u201cmistake\u201d on the poster where in fact **the ladders are failing while Becky\u2019s at the top and Hunter is still climbing!** Maybe this is a hint from the production team ;)\r\n\r\n**welp anyways it\u2019s just a theory :p I probably watched too many asian sope-operas**", "I can\u2019t help having a soft spot for a movie that name-drops several pro wrestlers as a means to convey a nice bit of subtle foreshadowing, and plays Warrants \u00abCherry Pie\u00bb on its soundtrack like every five minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s very difficult to empathize with the characters in this film; anyone who climbs a rusty, super creaky 2,000 foot TV tower (a choice so inane that under normal circumstances it\u2019s known as the Fallacy of the Climbing Villain) in the middle of bumfuck nowhere just for shits and giggles deserves whatever\u2019s coming to them. \r\n\r\nThe rationale, such as it is, behind the protagonists\u2019 actions is that life is \u00abtoo short\u00bb and \u00abyou gotta do something that makes you feel alive.\u00bb Methinks they\u2019re confusing joie de vivre with having a fucking death wish. According to these people\u2019s logic, Bobby De Niro and Chris Walken were really sucking the marrow out of life in those Russian roulette scenes from The Deer Hunter.  \r\n\r\nNow, that climbing artificial structures (known as buildering as well as several other names) is a reckless (not to mention illegal) thing to do doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that those who do it take it lightly. I\u2019m sure a lot of planning and prepping and getting in shape mentally and physically (even the relatively simple act of climbing a ladder becomes a Herculean labor when the ladder is twice as tall as the Eiffel Tower) precedes the actual deed.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t see any of that here; not even a training montage. For Hunter (Virginia Gardner) and Becky (Grace Caroline Currey) it\u2019s an overnight decision; sure, Hunter says she\u2019s has \u00abplanned\u00bb it, and she\u2019s some sort of daredevil You Tuber, but Becky is an out-of-practice rock climber who has ostensibly become a drunken slob in the year since her husband\u2019s Disney Villain Death. \r\n\r\nAll of the above notwithstanding, the film certainly makes the most of its chosen setting. The landscape around the top of the tower (consisting of a \u00abpizza-size platform\u00bb) betrays a green screen quality to it, but this is a rare occasion in which this actually works in the movie\u2019s favor; at such dizzying heights, wouldn\u2019t the world and everything in it look surreal? Or, to put it more bluntly, wouldn\u2019t your perception get all screwed up? \r\n\r\nMoreover, the stunts don\u2019t flat-out take your breath away, but they do kind of borrow it for a little while, which is better than nothing; also, there\u2019s a certain measure of suspense regarding whether or not help is on the way \u2014 and while this is the only movie that I can think of where the audience is left literally waiting for the other shoe to drop, this aspect of the plot actually involves a pretty neat shot of, well, a shoe dropping.", "Going into Fall, I did not have super high hopes, and unfortunately it met my expectations. This movie attempts to be something far greater than it ever needed to be, resulting in a super bloated experience that just feels completely unfocused. The nearly two-hour runtime is entirely too long for a plot that is on the surface, fairly bare bones. But the screenplay attempts to deliver multiple subplots that are supposed to develop our characters, but all it did was take away from the tension that it was building. For every scene where I was gripping my chair waiting to see what will happen next, there is a scene where the two characters talk about their feelings for far too long. Furthermore, there are story elements that are either too convenient or exist solely as obstacles for the sake of obstacles which detract from the overall believability.\r\n\r\nI do think Grace Caroline Currey is going to have a fantastic future in this industry, but her performance alongside Virginia Gardner left a lot to be desired. Currey did her best to save a pretty horrendous script, but it just was not enough. Despite this, the movie was directed fairly well, with great shots of the tower and of the action that was ensuing. The cinematography was fantastic, with beautiful skyboxes and sharp silhouettes of our protagonists that I particularly enjoyed.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this film would have been much better if it had stuck to being a cheesy thriller with a bare bones plot. All the extra filler really weighed down the overall experience.\r\n\r\nScore: 35% \ud83d\udca9\r\nVerdict: Bad", "**Smile\u2019s creepy trailers and clever marketing were the best parts of a movie with a meager plot drenched in uneasy sounds, and way too many jump scares.**\r\n\r\nSmile obsesses over saturating every moment in unsettling dread. The score and sound effects make every moment uneasy and uncomfortable, and not in a good way. Smile\u2019s premise bore many similarities to It Follows with much poorer execution. Smile stumbled from jump scare to jump scare. I started closing my eyes because the jump scares were so predictable, and I was tired of having disturbing images screamed in my face. I will say that Sosie Bacon did an excellent job with what she was given, with her performance being the only bright spot in the film. Unfortunately, the movie was unimpressive and tried to cloak mediocrity in a fountain of jump scares, stressful noises, and unpleasant moments.", "\"Dr. Rose Cotter\" (Sosie Bacon) is a dedicated clinical psychologist who witnesses the gruesome suicide of a young woman in her hospital consulting room. Traumatised, as you might expect, she gradually starts to suffer from unexpected goings on in her own life. Her relationship becomes unstable and soon she appears to have but a tenuous grasp on reality herself. What's going on? Is she doomed to a similar fate? This has something of the \"Azazel\" theory to it, and as the story develops director Parker Finn manages to build quite a degree of mystery and suspense. The malevolence of her haunting spirit is well captured by those working the audio - the sound effects and the score contribute well to the overall feel of this film. The acting though, well I am sorry - I found that to be a terrible let down. Initially, Bacon owned the film but after a few moments she just hadn't the weight to carry the thing in what is, essentially, a one-hander. Her support comes mainly for her ex-boyfriend/cop and all round sceptic about the whole thing \"Joel\" (Kyle Gallner) after her boyfriend \"Trevor\" (Jessie T. Usher) and her own erstwhile psychiatrist played by an indifferent Robin Weigert give up the ghost with her. Sadly, they offer little to add depth to this rather superficial horror effort. There are jump moments, but they lose their potency as this actor fails to capitalise on the tensions being created around her. Perhaps had the story spent less time on her character development, and the pace been tightened up a bit then we might have had less time to worry about that; but the style of the photography with too many lingering images merely serves to sterilise the whole thing for me. I was really disappointed, and after a while just wanted to go watch \"Fallen\" (1998) instead.", "Jebus! \ud83d\ude31 This is the most effective horror experience I've had since The Ring.

Going into this film, I thought I had a pretty good indication of how this was going to go down and was ready for a fun cheesy horror film that follow a pretty generic pattern, but boy was I wrong. Almost the entirety of the trailer was just the first act, and it left me seriously stumped at where this movie was going.\r\nThat sense of unknown really added to the thick tension that this movie brought throughout. There is a paranoia that occurs with both the audience and the main character. You never know who to trust, even if they give you all the indications that they are trustworthy.\r\n\r\nIn today's horror cinema, it is rare to see a movie so reliant on building tension rather than just jump scares galore. Not to say that this film does not have any jump scares, but they are there to enhance and bring a crescendo to the long scenes of tension and dread.\r\n\r\nOverall, the acting was brilliant. Georgina Campbell was fantastic. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd was a bit awkward at times, but I do think that was by choice, as his actor was a kind awkward sweetheart. Justin Long stole the show. His character added a bit of lightness and someone who the audience can really root against.\r\nThe movie does slightly fall of the rails in the third act, it does not take away from the experience that is Barbarian. In fact, I think it almost enhances the film as something truly unique.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _87%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_", "I like Justin Long, he was fantastic in Jeepers Creepers but Barbarian is uninspiring, to say the least. Not that that is the fault of the actors.\r\n\r\nWithout giving too much away, Barbarian feels a little like The Hills Have Eyes, meets Psycho, meets Quasimodo. The problem here is the scripting and handling. Its takes far too long for this story to get off the ground, it has weird, nonsensical plot holes and the reveal comes far to early. \r\n\r\nWhats left almost feels like a second film. It leaves only a reiteration of the essential earlier plot line with a few wrinkles, as the film moves towards its rather icky, conclusion.\r\n\r\nOf course, any sense of fear and tension, built up subtly in the first part of the film, is dissipated too. You know what's coming.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this film feels like it borrows from other horror flicks, in the worst possible way, leading to a disjointed but predictable viewing experience that's neither all that scary or even terribly interesting.

The houses of the Na&#39;vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry.

I rate any movie based on a few things. Warning! Potential Spoilers.\r\n\r\n**1. Story**. Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.\r\n\r\nThe story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don\u2019t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don\u2019t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro).\r\n\r\n**2. Characters**. Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.\r\nSpidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can\u2019t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin\u2019 Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. \r\n\r\n**3. Acting**. Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri\u2019s \u201cgone nuts\u201d scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don\u2019t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age.\r\n\r\n**4. Everything tied together**. A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle.  Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals.

It's a great second part to Avatar, getting back into the fight, setting a new environment and it actually left me even more thinking, of how we just destroy our earth and how bad humans can get.

So, I would really say: watch it, it is worth it, especially when you watch the first part before, to get back into the mood!", "Fluffy woke nonsense, minus anything that remotely resembles a story. That was my one and only impression of Avatar: The Way of Water. \r\n\r\nDripping with simpering woke cliches, a missing in action script, the only compensation offered is enough special effects \"eye candy\", to give you diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn summary, vacuous fair, I simply couldn't watch till the end. At a stretch, it might have worked for children but the violence and overall treatment, doesn't lend itself to a more junior viewers.", "Like, how am I supposed to watch movies that take place on earth now?? \r\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve seen Avatar the way of water\u2026 it feels a bit\u2026 strange. I expected to be overwhelmed but the scale and scope of the film, I expected to have a good headache. But none of that happened. I have a very different feeling\u2026 I feel\u2026 Proud. Proud knowing that my faith in this film payed off. Proud that this film was indeed epic. Its not a perfect movie and I do have my flaws. But this film gave me about everything I could ask for when it comes to a movie going experience, this deserves to make serious money at the box. James Cameron said in his interviews that he is the ONLY person that could direct an avatar film, and the internets response was \u201cJames\u2026 Chill\u201d, here\u2019s the thing, he was right. I cannot imagine another director doing something like this. Everything you love from Cameron is here, Terminator 2, Titanic, etc. \r\nThis was the best looking movie I\u2019ve ever seen.. and no other film will match this in the future that isn\u2019t an Avatar sequel. The VFX on the characters and creatures was perfect, no problems whatsoever. Sometimes some landscapes might have looked a little off, but the worst looking shot in this movie still looks better then almost every other CGI heavy action film. The underwater sequences  was awe inspiring, I could\u2019ve watched the underwater sequences in this film forever. the amount of work put into the underwater sequences definitely paid off. At first I wasn\u2019t so sure about 48fps, during the first 20 or so minutes, I thought I would be detracted the whole time, but I wasn\u2019t, I adjusted about half an hour in, and was completely emerged into a film like I never have before. \r\nThe action in this movie was insane, the action was always at and 11 out of 10. You felt the scale, the weight, the stakes. \r\nLike I said, this wasn\u2019t a perfect film. When the movie started, I was so sure about how I would feel about this movie. It starts voiceover heavy and with lots of quick cuts as if a lot has been cut from the film within the opening, Im sure there will be an extended cut to this, and I\u2019m curious if it will add to it. The dialogue in the first film was the best, and this film does have stronger dialogue. But there are still a couple scenes where it did feel a little off, but it was mostly with the younger characters. As it wasn\u2019t Constant, it was just like a line here to there every 20 minutes or so. While, I did say that the opening needed a little more to it, there are chucks in the middle that didn\u2019t need to be there, and was just there to be eye candy, but it wasn\u2019t really a big issue with me, Cause it was some of the best eye candy ever put on film.\r\nI\u2019m tired of people complaining about the story to these avatar films, it feels like people put the plot to these movies on a unrealistic standard. The plot here is basic, and yeah, it might feel a little to basic at Times. But I don't really think it was something worth mentioning critically. \r\nOverall, this was a perfectly crafted film with a pretty good script, that provided a theater experience I\u2019ll never forget.\r\n\r\n9.3/10", "_The Gray Man_ has some impressive action sequences, but is such a lackluster film experience overall. Most of the action is bogged down by sloppy editing where a complete absence of proper lighting ruins whatever positives the film had going for it. The talented cast does what they can with their roles, but it\u2019s not enough to make the film entertaining. Ana de Armas is mostly forgettable apart from shooting tranquilizer darts in guy\u2019s butts and firing a rocket launcher a few times. Tedious and sluggish with punches and kicks and kills that barely satisfy, _The Gray Man_ is a dead on arrival action thriller that squanders potential almost as often as Ryan Gosling chews gum.\r\n\r\n**Full Review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Gray-Man-2022-The-Yawn-Ultimatum", "Well at least this latest Netflix effort gives us some eye candy in the form of the annoyingly ageless Ryan Gosling and a slightly hammy Chris Evans, but the rest of it is derivative even by their standards. We start with a young man being released from prison by \"Fitzroy\" (Tommy Lee Jones) so he can join an elite CIA hit squad. Named \"Six\" (Gosling), his first mission is straight out of the \"Mechanic\" (2011) only it's an erstwhile colleague that he is sent to eradicate. A task that proves remarkably simple but is accomplished not before, luckily for us, he is given a micro chip that illustrates his new boss \"Carmichael\" (an underwhelming Reg\u00e9-Jean Page) is about as crooked as the day is long. There now ensues a series of long \"John Wick\" style combat scenes as try as this hugely well equipped CIA operation does, it simply cannot capture \"Six\". Desperate times call for desperate measures so \"Hansen\" (Evans) is drafted in to finally do the business by kidnapping the easily accessible niece of the now retired TLJ, and using her as leverage he tries a different tack. Wholesale slaughter follows and along the way some lovely buildings in Prague and Croatia become neat piles of rubble; the local citizens are dropping like flies sending those in the CIA PR department into spasms... Well you get the gist. The always over-rated Ana de Armas sports quite a colourful suit at the start, but as usual her contributions are pretty unimpressive; TLJ is nowhere near his best and the thing lurches on towards a really inevitable conclusion that stretched out the thinnest of plots and showed a really disconcerting image of a CIA completely out of control, running rampage - and that scenario isn't remotely plausible. There is plenty of car-chasing, gunfights and pyrotechnic displays but that's nowhere near enough to compensate for a pretty unremarkable script and an amalgam of stories we have seen done better elsewhere, many times before. That said, if you get a chance to see it during it's limited cinema run then I'd give it a go. On television this is just subscription fodder with A-list cows that you will instantly forget.", "Seing this as another run to the mill Netflix release should not keep your hopes up. Netflix is where mediocre goes to congreate to the masses.\r\nWe have another spy action movie amongst us. Last one before this was Kate, that was another bland action-spy movie.\r\nThis offers absolutely NOTHING new to the table. We seen every trick this movie offer before. Over-skilled agents. Clever coreographed fight scenes, Trick tactics, agents with no names, An agency who elimintaes their own agents, expendable kill teams, plenty conspiracies and tons of action.\r\nBut i have to say i enjoy Gosling alone in this one. He plays it cool. Its  just shame that he is backed up with a script littered with clich\u00e9s from start to end.\r\nWe also have Ana De Armas who is fast becoming the new Tom Holland that appears everywhere. An actress that is milked trought the Hollywood system and spewed out to never be heard of again some day.\r\nBut the movie is for sure a worthy popcorn flick with no expetations to give. On a entertainment standpoint it delivers.", "Anyone thinking the CIA is anything other than awful, should in my humble opinion, take a long look at their actual history.\r\n\r\nAnyway, putting aside the predictable effort to set up this nasty little three letter acronym as virtuous, there's not a lot going on here.\r\n\r\nIts your usual rather heavy handed, cruel, cynical, US action flick.\r\n\r\nExposition is polished but then it needs to be, because there's not a lot else on offer that I can see. Suffice to say, instantly watchable and just as forgettable.\r\n\r\nSo if you want simple action and can look past the not so subtle messaging, this is a marginally alright watch.", "What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.\r\n\r\n<em>'Top Gun: Maverick'</em> is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.\r\n\r\nThe story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.\r\n\r\nMonica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little clich\u00e9, though overall I approve.\r\n\r\nA great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/top-gun-maverick-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Top Gun: Maverick is the return of pure, nostalgic blockbusters, instantly becoming one of this year's personal favorites. The best aerial action sequences ever amaze even the highest expectations, not only due to the absolutely insane real stunts but largely because of the flawless contribution of all filmmaking elements.\r\n\r\nThe surprisingly emotional screenplay helps Tom Cruise deliver one of the best performances of his career. Perfect editing is essential to creating such realism, as well as raising the tension levels for one of the best final acts within the respective genre.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, the memorable score loaded with epic tracks makes the theater experience the only way this magnificent work should be seen.\r\n\r\nSuperior to the original in every way.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "A lot of things in this movie do not make sense, like \"why not use F-35?\", \"why didn't cruise missiles target enemy air defence and planes in hangars?\" to name a few. \r\n\r\nThe original movie had some seriousness built into it, the sequel I think is closer to a comic book movie. Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of conservatives reminiscing Reagan years would watch it, that should be enough to make it a hit.\r\n\r\nI think that is also the reason of the high score. To me the movie quality is more of 5 ~ 7 out of 10.\r\n\r\nJust don't think too much when watching it, but I don't think that is too big a problem for the target audience.", "Haven't seen a movie this perfect in decades. It was most obviously written and directed with the audience in mind - no politics, no preaching, no gratuitous sex, no woke, no offensive casting or characters. Brilliant, simplistic screenwriting and thrill rides. The original, if you've seen it, was iconic as it was, and to know it makes the second film here more enjoyable, but even if you're not familiar with the background of the characters it's clearly presented enough to be a stand-alone enjoyable film.", "> Loved this movie.  Even had me guessing to the end.  Seems like every cast member picked to play their role was the only person that could pull it off especially for the song of Goose.  9.9/10 sequel never lived up to original this one did. 10/10", "This is how American movies should be made.\r\n\r\nI have to confess I'd all but given up on Hollywood. The incessant woke indoctrination had led me to the conclusion, the US film industry, had little left to offer and then along came, Top Gun: Maverick.\r\n\r\nA simple, well rendered, military action flick that reinvents the formula for success and doggedly sticks to it. \r\n\r\nEverything about this film is polished. It comfortably updates the 80's original with style, verve and hands down top shelf acting from Tom Cruise and the cast.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of NATO or US exceptionalism but this films such quality, it even had me cheering, irrespective.\r\n\r\nEntertainment as it should be.....\r\n\r\n10/10.", "**Best movie of 2022 so far, and I don\u2019t see what could possibly top it!**\r\n\r\nThis movie is nearly perfect in every way. Top Gun: Maverick is a masterpiece, from the pacing to the acting to the cinematography to the character development to the casting to the writing. I can\u2019t think of a single thing that didn\u2019t blow me away. The intensity and intentionality of the action were magnificent and balanced with heartfelt moments of character growth and story.

But boy i was wrong, this movie is the definition of Awesomeness in Cinema.\r\n\r\nLet me start with the Story. This movie doesnt have any complex story and some of it structure if im looking at it, kinda almost the same as the first one. But is it identical? yes? so it means they just copying it? no. what i mean is Peter Craig did take a few ideas from the first movie for a few scene (i think its a homage for the first movie) but the context has alot more meaning than the first one tbh.\r\n\r\nNow Scoring, Lorne Balfe did great job for remaking the Top Gun Anthem... Damn it feels good hearing that theme again... and also, i want to applause Onerepublic and Lady Gaga for creating such an awesome soundtrack for the movie\r\n\r\nNow lastly for cinematography and visual effect, its probably the first time in my life i got out from IMAX and said \"i paid 10$ dollar for this movie? i feel like i should've paid more. This movie is too good\". The sound design, the real action from fighter jet, the bloodpumping visual. It all works together creating this masterpiece. its been a decade since i feel this immerse on the movie.\r\n\r\n**In conclusion, ill keep this short\r\nThis is the reason why Movie Theatre was created, now go watch it on IMAX. Trust me, you'll never regret it.**", "This was a good movie. It has a pretty generic story, but its filled with a lot of heart and the right music at the right times. It also helps that on the technical side. It crispy clear video and amazing audio keeps you totally immersed.", "Really solid action-thriller with amazing stunts and pulls on the heartstrings without feeling forced. Tom Cruise is great as usual and Miles Teller was fine though didn't feel like he had enough time to shine, but his scenes with Cruise were good. Jennifer Connelly has aged really well and they did nice service for Val Kilmer's Iceman. Really solid, entertaining old fashioned blockbuster. **4.25/5**", "Top Gun: Maverick had a ton of praise when I finally got around to watching it and it did a relatively good job living up to it.\r\n\r\nMy main two complaints from the original have been entirely corrected in it's sequel: cheesy dialogue and terrible shot selection in the aerial sequences. The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.\r\n\r\nThe overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final \"suicide\" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.\r\n\r\nThe performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.\r\n\r\nThis film is a blast, and I really wish I would have made the time to see it in theaters. I really enjoyed this and I am definitely not one who fancies these types of films, but it captured me.\r\n\r\nScore: 87%\r\nVerdict: Excellent", "You're not supposed to like this, very literally.  IMDb will block your reviews of this movie if you praise it.  Amazon (owned by the same company) is fudging the like ratio, and Youtube did the same with the trailer.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense.  It really does.\r\n\r\nMaverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  The white guy isn't evil.  America isn't evil.  It's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.\r\n\r\nFrom start to finish it's just a solid apolitical action movie.\r\n\r\nSo of course you are supposed to hate it, it literally breaks all the rules of modern Hollywood.\r\n\r\nAnd that was why it was the biggest blockbuster of the past few years.  That is why it had returns that would be a mega-bock buster pre-COVID.  It's the type of movie that people actually want to see, which is why it's under attack on certain sites.  You're not supposed to know that people like it and they weren't supposed to make a movie that people wanted to see.\r\n\r\nEverything has to be a propaganda piece.  \r\n\r\nBut you want to know a secret?  If this came out in the 80s it wouldn't have done well.  It's not as good of an action movie as they had back then.  It actually sort of sucks compared to a lot of the classic action movies of this genre.\r\n\r\nBut then it came out in 2022 and the rules have all changed.  Today everything is racist or far left.  So what you have here is a movie that is great... by 2022 standards... simply because it's not the crap that Hollywood is shoving down your throats and demanding that you like.", "He might look good in a white T-shirt but the thing is, as Zac Efron gets older he looks more and more like an automaton. When he was younger, he had a charm about him - now he just looks like his life consists of nothing but the gym, the manscapists and a bath in yesterday's excess kale smoothie mix! Add to that really lacklustre performance some screaming from a competent youngster in Ryan Kiera Armstrong (\"Charlie\") and we are left with a very mediocre adaptation of this pretty lightweight Stephen King story that is big on pyrotechnic effects, certainly, but on very little else. There is a story: the youngster can cause things to combust at will when she gets stressed or annoyed; her father can bend people to his will making his eyes bleed in the process - quite an effective cure for smokers who want to give up; and her mother - Sidney Lemmon, well she too has a quirk - but I cannot remember what it was (but it definitely wasn't firefighting). Anyway, those who scientifically enhanced this family are hot on their trail - and it's all a question of who will prevail. Well it would be if you were still remotely bothered but after half an hour I just wasn't. For a movie about conflagration - it's sadly all a bit of a damp squib.", "Eh, just another pointless remake/re-adaptation, although I don't mind it since the 1984 version wasn't great either. Nothing terrible but not anything special either. Performances were bland and not even the pyrotechnics weren't all that impressive. I guess it's fine to watch for free on Peakcock Premium but even so, you're really not missing anything. **2.25/5**", "**Ironically, this fire never got going\u2014total dud.**\r\n\r\nWhat? How? I didn't expect to be blown away, but I also didn't expect to be bored. I love Blumhouse flicks, and their fresh take on The Invisible Man had my expectations high for their version of Firestarter. Unfortunately, this was as straight to streaming as a movie could feel. Think Push (2009) but much more mediocre.", "_Pearl_ is a great character study that dives deeper in the stakes that an individual will go to attain success. It is unquestionable that the main question people will ask is, does it live up to X? While I do think it is a good film that I thoroughly enjoyed, it does not overtake its predecessor and that is completely okay. They are two entirely different movies but achieve their goals brilliantly.\r\n\r\nThis film is the textbook definition of a slow burn. The movie drags on and continues to provide this eerie tension as the viewer knows what the end result of this tragic film will be, but still remains locked in to see how it will unfold. I really enjoyed the first act, the character introductions were fantastic, and the audience has an instant connection with Pearl. But the second act drags a little more than I would have liked, but by the minute it is getting stale the third comes to pick up the pace and deliver a satisfying conclusion.\r\n\r\nMia Goth is utterly fantastic in this film. There is a solid six-minute monologue of just her acting her ass off. One take, one angle, and somehow, she was able to lock me in completely. She has burst on to the scene with X and Pearl, and I cannot wait to see where her career goes from here.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film is great, but expectations should be had going into it. It is not going to be an action-packed slasher like its predecessor, but those elements are sprinkled in and work well with the overall film. If you enjoyed X, you should definitely watch this.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _81%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Great_", "The only way for this movie to wow you is to give it some respect. Ultimately, this movie is not for everyone and that's okay.\r\n\r\nSimply, Skinamarink is a mood piece. Most people come into the horror genre to mock the stupid decisions of the characters, gawk at the intense gore, or to be thrilled in a safe environment. This movie, however, will leave those viewers with nothing. This movie is for the viewers who want to be enveloped by the liminal mood. It sends them back to their childhood, when they were afraid to walk around their house at night. It sent me back to when I would sneak downstairs to try to watch some cartoons and eat cereal, leaving the house dark and quiet so I don't wake anyone else up.\r\n\r\nMost of this film is a blank screen with VHS-like fuzz that tricks your mind into seeing things that aren't there. The cinematography is brilliant in the way that it always shows you JUST enough that you want to peek around the corner, but you also don't want to. The amount of interpretations of this very simple movie speaks to its density. The symbolism and ambiguity let the mind run wild with theories and explanations.\r\n\r\nIf I were to change one thing, then I would make the movie at least a half hour shorter. It would be way more approachable if it were more like \"The Backrooms\" by Kane Pixels on YouTube. However, I also feel like the length is necessary to fully set the viewer in the mindset to fully enjoy the second half of the film. Thankfully, there is no producer to get in the way of Kyle Edward Ball's genius film making.\r\n\r\nI suggest watching this movie at night with no external noise and no distractions, sitting on the floor of your living room to get the full experience. Give it the respect it deserves. And if you can't get into the mood they expect, then you might as well turn off the TV and watch the empty screen for two hours.", "MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/\r\n\r\n\"The King's Daughter is everything viewers expected: a formulaic, uninteresting story filled with old-fashioned cliches and spine-chilling visual effects - not in a good way.\r\n\r\nNot a single filmmaker and respective creative team deserve to have their work stuck in a seven-year limbo until it's released, let alone due to scheduling and budget issues.

The characters are like pictures of a bad artist, flat and empty. Facial expressions and forms are alien. There is no aesthetic admiration for this attempt at expression in 3d. No grace and beauty. There is no depth and love, an adequate plot. Inappropriate flat humor. A fierce mockery of the innermost. A ridiculous untalented division without a sense of beauty, reminiscent of the very pirated products from the movie. They piled everything up and made an unintelligible dump. A bunch of some defective characters, like that Sonic who talks about the existence of the original Sonic, by the way... They ridiculed the key points, just for fun, quite unreasonably, only comedy is completely out of place here, as are the creators-comedians. And all this, of course, under the sauce \"We love Rescuers\". Well, well... We couldn't do it, in general, for real. In a Disney way. Only that picture was remembered, which hung on the wall of the actor Roquefort. And how wonderful it would be if the whole movie was of this style and with an adequate plot.\r\nFortunately, this is not an original reality that could continue the canon.

Baz Luhrmann's style theoretically fits the legendary singer's vibrant aura, and the filmmaker's intention is clear.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the frenetic, choppy editing and the restless camera movements rather come off as a messy, confusing, headache-inducing atmosphere instead of elements that elevate the overall piece.

There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography.\r\n\r\nThe Last Wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.\r\n\r\nWith most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that this movie has restored the Shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward. Hype has officially been restored for Shrek 5!\r\n\r\nScore: 86%\r\nVerdict: Great", "I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.\r\n\r\nAfter an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.\r\n\r\nWhat I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.\r\n\r\nI adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.", "This one sort of slipped through the cracks didn't it?  I mean, it has a very good, very heartwarming story that helps define a character's growth over the length of the plot.  It has a story about hope and sacrifice and struggle.\r\n\r\nIt is a good movie.\r\n\r\nHow does a movie this good get made today?  Isn't this sort of the opposite of everything that current Hollywood stands for?\r\n\r\nWhere is the strong female lead replacing Puss in Boots as the hero?  Where are the identity politics?  Where is the nonstop shaming of Straight White Men?  Where is the depiction of half the country as absolute evil?  \r\n\r\nHow can they make a western movie that doesn't shame the west at every possible turn?\r\n\r\nI have absolutely no idea how this could have been made, but what I can say is that it is fantastic, it is moving, it is fun for the whole family and it has a decent nonpolitical message.  The main character is heroic.  This is just... well, this is a movie that doesn't seem like it could possibly be made in today's Hollywood.", "Really good movie better then the first. I loved the beard it was pretty funny looking. The storyline was way better then part one.", "This is a very good movie and can be a difficult one to watch if you know the history as I did, I of course knew where it was going front the beginning and where it would end up. The writing was strong and the acting superb much of the time. I highly recommend it for anyone young or old who is unfamiliar with he story.\r\n\r\nDespite the rawness of Danielle Deadwiler\u2019s performance and the clean way the tragedy unfolded, on some weird level I wasn\u2019t as affected emotionally as I would have expected to be. I don\u2019t even know why.  A few intangible reasons perhaps? Such as not feeling a lot of chemistry between the main characters. Like I say, I am not even sure myself.  It is an excellent movie, but not one that will stick with me as a powerful slice of history like this should, or make me likely to feel I have to watch it again. But yes, do see it once at least.", "It sure has been a long wait for the sequel (7 years to be precise) but I think it's safe to say that the film does not disappoint. While the film lacks a strong plot and is louder than its prequel, it easily covers up with delightful comedy, a sprinkle of nostalgia and a satisfying dose of lovable Minions!", "Very good movie, watched with my family and no regrets on it. Recommend to everybody!.", "Some glow up!\r\n\r\n2015's <em>'Minions'</em> wasn't a film I found enjoyment with (6/10, fwiw), but its sequel genuinely entertained thoroughly. It doesn't offer anything truly hilarious, but there were a relatively high number of times where it made me chuckle. I was not expecting anything positive from it, yet it actually pulls through with a fun time. I'd even say it's the best release from the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nSteve Carell remains a strong lead for these <em>'Despicable Me'</em> projects, as does Pierre Coffin - the voice of the Minions, of course! Taraji P. Henson is an excellent addition, as is Alan Arkin. Michelle Yeoh is good value too, but her character is a bit lame unfortunately - a bit of a waste of Yeoh, to be honest. Elsewhere, animation-wise: quality - very vibrant!\r\n\r\nLastly, how many butt shots is too many butt shots? I counted at least 3, 4 perhaps: 3(?) x Minions and 1 x Gru.

Well, anyway Hayes isn't exactly rushing back to his friend who is gradually running out of food, water, having hallucinations, fending off wild dogs and even a rogue Irish women as his grasp on reality starts to slip... Efron is actually not bad as the man who gradually succumbs to despair and dehydration, but the story plods along far too slowly for almost eighty minutes before the last ten minutes provide a denouement with a bit of a twist to the tale. It is good that Efron is pushing himself away from his pretty boy roles - indeed the make-up folks here do such a good job that I doubt even a biblical leper would welcome him into their home, but the story all takes way too long to get going and the it, quite literally, crawls along. The production does look good - the desert photography has an almost naturally sepia colour to it that emphasises just how hostile this terrain is and the narrative does say something about the degree to which greed is hard wired into our psyche though; and the perils we will endure or permit to obtain wealth.

The DCEU is about to get way more convoluted and underwhelming than ever before if this is the future of live action DC films.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Black-Adam-20220-Review-A-Stale-and-Disjointed-Antihero-Kerfuffle", "**Black Adam might not reinvent the wheel, but it doesn\u2019t have to. It just wants to take you on a fun, entertaining, exciting superhero ride!**\r\n\r\nBlack Adam has its haters, and I can understand why. It doesn\u2019t necessarily break new ground in the superhero genre, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being awesome! Action-packed from start to finish. The effects are incredible. I kept myself from saying Wow out loud on multiple occasions. Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Black Adam is absolutely ruthless, ripping armies of henchmen with ease and speed. I was worried a PG-13 rating might soften his brutality, but it did not! The action sequences looked amazing and were well done. I really liked the Justice Society characters, although they all felt a little stereotypical with a SpiderMan jokester, a wise old Professor X, and a quipping leader in the vain of Wolverine or Deadshot. Pierce Brosnan was perfect at Dr. Fate, making me wish he hadn\u2019t been relegated to special guest star status. The movie didn\u2019t waste a ton of time giving background on each character which was wise with so many new heroes on screen. The film had its moments of cheese but didn\u2019t overdo it. Definitely watch the mid-credit scene. It\u2019s stupendous! Black Adam was a fine addition to the superhero genre, and I look forward to what comes next.", "> _\"My powers are not a gift. They're a curse, born out of rage.\"_\r\n\r\nI had a blast watching this in theaters. This was very bombastic, with a lot of cool action, but also telling a heartfelt story about Black Adam.\r\n\r\nIt was very inventive how they depicted Black Adam's origin, keeping it a mystery up near the end. Dwayne Johnson was born to play Black Adam. He steals every scene he's in playing a badass anto-hero.\r\n\r\nNow the Justice Society, while they didn't have a backstory in the film, they each had prequel comics detailing their backstory. Which I really dig, these comics are meant to sell comics, after all. Might as well get the audience to buy the comics to get into some great stories (they are also currently doing this with The Flash). The movie actually starts right where the Doctor Fate prequel comic ends, so I don't think it's apographa. Doctor Fate played by Pierce Brosnan was a standout. He really put his all into this character. Aldis Hodge was also a standout as Hawkman.\r\n\r\nThe surprise villain of Black Adam, Sabbac, was a really good addition to the Shazam! mythos. If the wizards have their own champion, why doesn't the seven deadly sins have one? Sabbac is the answer to that. Doctor Fate's battle with him was really cool.\r\n\r\nOverall, this wasn't as bad as the critics were saying, I had a fun time! Be sure to stay for the mid-credits scene!", "cool movie", "_Black Adam_ is in every aspect a generic superhero movie. There is nothing that really separates this for me, besides the body count that Black Adam stacks up during the film.\r\n\r\nOne thing I need to mention is the audio quality. So many lines of dialogue sound like they were recorded straight off from a cell phone. They do not match the scene at all and it was incredibly jarring throughout the entirety of the film. While I am talking about sound, in almost every fight scene the film included a badass rap song. It was cool the first time, but it got old and corny fast.\r\n\r\nThe plot was very generic from all aspects. It suffers by trying to catch the audience up in the first act. The film introduces the Justice Society and Black Adam and quickly accelerates the plot to start the main conflict of the film. It felt rushed and the conflict between the JSA and Black Adam was forced, nothing about it felt genuine. The villian in this movie was so forgettable, by the time he is introduced the conflict is over. I had zero emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. The dialogue was pretty bad as well, the scenes constantly switched from serious to comedy causing both aspects to fall flat for me.\r\n\r\nThe performances were okay, everyone was pretty average including Dwayne Johnson. Nothing spectacular and nothing bad enough for me to notice.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was excited for this new phase and direction of the DCEU and was left disappointed. Definitely one of the poorer movies in the franchise.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _48%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Average_", "Very Good Movie", "I enjoyed the action mainly sometimes the shotty CGI took me out of it. Very surprised that a triple A title in this age would have subpar CGI at times. The story was ok, but most of the dialog was poorly written. Especially with 5he scenes the boy was in. On the tech side the video is crispy clear. Just gorgeous. And the audio is also great. There is a lot going on.", "The worst ever movie I've ever seen.", "Black Adam feels dated. And not like it came out at the dawn of superhero movies. Before that. Like it came out during TMNT II: Secrets of the Ooze.", "OK, this isn't a bad movie.  \r\n\r\nBut, it as a bit much CGI (like everything else nowadays) and I think modern audiences are getting tired of paying out the wazoo to basically watch a video game.\r\n\r\nAnd then the narration.  The voice is too young and though it does make sense with the plot, it is jarring because basic tradition is that narrations have an older and wiser voice... Morgan Freeman, Spock, etc.  So that is going to instantly set the radiance off.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Snyderverse is over.  Period.  They made no illusions about that, we have known it was over for years, there was even a massive backlash about his cut of Justice League because it was given the fans what they wanted and thus bad... because politics and politics have declared that people that are enthusiastic about anything that isn't left wing politics are evil.\r\n\r\nBecause the world has gone insane.\r\n\r\nBut the greater point is that people already don't care.  They not only already don't care, but they were sort of told not to by the very people that made the movie.  \r\n\r\nIt's world is over.  This world ended before it was released.\r\n\r\nWhich, sucks, because Shazam was my favorite to come out of the DCEU.\r\n\r\nPeople aren't going to care.  They aren't going to watch it and when they do it's going to come with disdain.\r\n\r\nBut as far as a Superhero movie goes... come on, you're not really getting much.  They aren't Chinatown, they are just popcorn munchers and nothing more, and that isn't bad.  But let's call it what it is.\r\n\r\nUnless they are political like the MCU, they are just mindless action and gags.  And if they are political like the MCU, they sort of stink.\r\n\r\nThis is relatively politics free.  It's high on adventure and so-so on action (see the above CGI comment) so you have a decent film for the genre. It just should have come out before they declared the universe dead.", "I quite enjoyed this movie. Given the story (some superhero wakes up 5000 year later) I was a bit afraid that it would be a lot of unintelligent Hollywood slapstick humor with Black Adam trying to adapt to modern society. There where a little bit of that but, luckily, not too much.\r\n\r\nI did actually have some hopes for this movie given that those woke intellectual midgets that the rubbish site Rotten Tomatoes calls critics gave it a rotten rating whereas the actual audience gave it a near 90% fresh rating.\r\n\r\nOverall it is a decent story without too many ludicrous elements in it. It works pretty well from start to finish.\r\n\r\nThe Rock is, well, he is The Rock which is good. He did play a more serious character in this movie than he has done in many of his movies though. Pierce Brosnan (I actually didn\u2019t recognize him at first) worked very well as Dr Fate. The rest of the characters was okay but nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nIt is a superhero movie so of course there were plenty of special effects, CGI and action. That is really the main reason to watch these movies and I enjoyed every moment of it. Especially when Black Adams let loose.\r\n\r\nThe action is sometimes quite violent actually with limbs and heads flying. I don\u2019t mind at all. There are way too many movies that some Hollywood bean counter has forced the producers/directors to ruin because they thought it would appeal to a larger audience. Well, then pick a story that is made for that audience you stupid morons.\r\n\r\nAs usual the mid credits scene hinted that there would be more movies with Black Adams and, as long as they keep The Rock as Black Adams in them I can certainly see myself watch more Black Adams.", "sketched, never completed\r\n\r\nLooks like the director/writer had some notes, and didn't get around to write a complete script. So the movie starts out very promising, but then gradually runs out of ideas, until the last half is just ticking off the boxes of expected items.\r\n\r\nThe quirky, funny look into modelling is followed by a well cast and (in some moments) acted part about relationship issues between inexperienced, clueless, and selfish people. \r\nWe learn that the na\u00efve male model is actually in love, while his female model/influencer counterpart tells him he's nice entertainment until she finds a rich guy to be trophy wife for. This doesn't deter him... and that was the promising bit. \r\n\r\nNext, they are on a luxury yacht for the decadents; and there is still potential for a really good story: the upstairs/downstairs angle is only implemented in a few scenes, most screen time of this part is spent on lavish dining with icky \"haute cuisine\" food in rough seas, and the consequences thereof.\r\n\r\nThat was when the really good part could've started: how to they meet or avoid gazes the next day, the day after? What has changed, how, what shouldn't and how do class barriers break?\r\n\r\nInstead, we get a clownish intermezzo and next, the boring island section. This part is just tedious agitprop, reducing the (already shallow) characters to templates, and doing all the expected bits. Waste of time, talent, and a nice beach.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason, people are so content with half-baked products these days, you can even win prizes this way. 5/10, there's better ways to waste time, but this isn't the worst either.", "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n\r\nWriter / director Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2018s wickedly sharp black comedy \u201cTriangle of Sadness\u201d offers a biting satire of everything from gender roles, capitalist society, corruption of power, modern masculinity, and the social hierarchies that result from a system that encourages class division. The film has a lot to say and does it well, wading through layers of stinging dialogue, sophisticated observations, and lots and lots of vomit.\r\n\r\nThe film is a lot more than its now-infamous fifteen minute puking scene, however. It\u2019s an in-your-face story that doesn\u2019t shy away from confronting everything from the rampant abuse of the less privileged to the primitive savagery of human nature.\r\n\r\nInstagram influencers and celebrity model couple Carl (Harris Dickinson) and Yaya (Charlbi Dean) are invited on an all-expenses-paid vacation on a luxury cruise in exchange for expert promotion on social media. The ritzy yacht is frequented by ultra-rich passengers who demand the finest things in life (one of the early scenes features a helicopter air-dropping a couple of jars of Nutella in the ocean, which is hilarious because it\u2019s so ridiculous).\r\n\r\nAs Carl and Yaya settle in, they begin to meet their very wealthy fellow guests, including a couple of British arms dealers, a Russian oligarch (Zlatko Buric), and an unhinged Marxist boat captain (Woody Harrelson) who spends the majority of the cruise drunk and locked in his cabin. If not a recipe for disaster, it certainly sets the stage for an interesting few days at sea. But after the ship encounters a vicious storm and capsizes, the handful of survivors are left stranded on a deserted island and fighting for survival.\r\n\r\nThe film has a lot to say about feminism, sexism, today\u2019s social-media obsessed society, the gross exploitation of the working class, the conflicts between the haves and have-nots, the shallowness of the fashion industry, and lots more.\r\n\r\nWhile it would\u2019ve been the easier route to demonize the billionaires in his story, \u00d6stlund instead chooses to make them appropriately ostentatious yet still kind of likeable. They\u2019re not entirely jackasses, they\u2019re just mega-wealthy. Setting the film on a cruise ship is brilliant too, as they have a built-in class system between passengers and amongst the crew. The boat symbolizes the hierarchy of social classes, including the officers, the predominantly white \u201cface time\u201d staff, and the lower rungs that include the cooks, engineers, janitorial workers, and other people of color. It\u2019s satisfying to watch the pecking order not only completely dissolve but get turned upside down after the yacht sinks. That\u2019s when the working class takes over, because they\u2019re the ones who know how to get stuff done.\r\n\r\nThe film offers shrewd observations and a critique of class and privilege, culminating in a third act that delivers a bountiful amount of schadenfreude. The best is the story of \u201ctoilet worker\u201d Abigal (Dolly De Leon, who gives the film\u2019s standout performance), a woman who quickly takes command on the deserted island because she is the only person with any sort of survival skills. After starting a fire, catching fish, and handling the distribution of the small amount of supplies left on the lifeboat, she demands that everyone refer to her as \u201cCaptain.\u201d She even begins trading food for sexual favors with Carl.\r\n\r\n\u00d6stlund\u2019s film about a cruise from hell is an achievement in satire that effortlessly skewers many timely subjects. He sets his eyes squarely on deserved targets and dismantles them with wit and sophistication, making \u201cTriangle of Sadness\u201d one of the smartest and most interesting films of the year.", "It is a shame that Devotion was somewhat overshadowed with another somewhat popular aviator movie this year... but, it separates itself with a more grounded and dramatic approach.\r\n\r\nDevotion follows the first Black aviator, Jessie Brown, (Jonathan Majors) and his friendship with fellow pilot Tom Hudner, (Glen Powell). At first, the two are at odds with each other, trying to gauge what type of man they were. Overtime the two grow an incredible bond that is extremely genuine as they persevere the struggles of the war and the constant racism Brown endures.\r\n\r\nThe main relationship of this movie worked incredibly well, the chemistry between Majors and Powell was infectious. Hudner displays a genuine desire to be a good person and stand up for Brown, but his naiveness gets in his way as he does not see his actions are causing more harm than good. This film does a great job of portraying the nuances of racism, some old and some that still are relevant today. It did so very soft handed and as a backdrop of the film, which worked well in delivering the main narrative of this emotional story.\r\n\r\nI would have to argue that the action in this film is almost better than Top Gun: Maverick. Almost every action scene is in combat with enemy fighters and anti-air tanks, as opposed to training sessions and montages. This creates a much more tense experience as at any second our main characters could get shot down or killed. The high stakes mixed with great cinematography created a very riveting action experience.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a really great time with this film. It is great balance of action and drama with an ending that brought tears to my eye.\r\n\r\nScore: 79%\r\nVerdict: Great", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/jurassic-world-dominion-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Jurassic World Dominion is a massive disappointment on virtually every level.

But the chemistry between the cast is almost non-existent and it feels like the film is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel. If the _Jurassic Park/Jurassic World_ franchise is to continue, it desperately needs to go in a refreshing and unseen direction.

Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.\r\n\r\nI really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen \u201cbig companies are bad\u201d story with dinosaurs thrown in.\r\n\r\nThe story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack.

And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the \u201cheroes\u201d doesn\u2019t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?\r\n\r\nIdiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.\r\n\r\nThey brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.\r\n\r\nIt is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today\u2019s Hollywood morons. I\u2019ve been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real, life like dinosaurs it was just wow. But now, not even the special effects can save this movie. It is not a good movie, plain and simple.", "Jurassic World Dominion fails to impress as a dinosaur movie, as the plot seems to be a poor choice. The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus, giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise. Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story. Chris Pratt's character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading character.\r\n\r\nThe camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy, with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion, especially in fast-paced scenes like the one in Malta. The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing, with the country portrayed as a dirty, third-world Arabic nation covered in desert sand, which is not an accurate representation of the country. The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOverall, Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a well-planned and executed story. It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies. Although the movie is not a complete disaster, it falls short of being an enjoyable watch. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the length of the movie seems to be excessive, and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audience's attention. The story's predictability adds to the monotony, leaving little to surprise or engage the viewers.\r\n\r\nAs if to acknowledge the franchise's overreliance on gimmicks and sequels, Ian Malcolm's line, \"Jurassic World?

Viola Davis' steely strong portrayal of Nanisca delivers a mighty yet caring warrior general, creating the genuine and dynamic atmosphere of the film. The entire cast gave stellar performances, but the stand out was Lashana Lynch as Izogie. Lynch was as over-powering, unstoppable, and skilled as any warrior in the film while also serving as the heart, humor, and strength of her Agojie sisters. The film was a fantastic adventure epic but lagged a little in the middle as it focused solely on character development and exposition.

Action sequences hold high levels of brutality, accompanied by excellent choreography and an energetic score.\r\n\r\nOne of the best movies of the year... ignoring the butchered Portuguese.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "Oh come on with the good reviews, even if she wasn't an evil slave trader, the film comes across as a melodramatic propaganda piece from start to finish...\r\n\r\n... but then again, it was a melodramatic propaganda piece from start to finish...\r\n\r\n... but that's not why it's one of the movies with a huge disparancy between critic and user reviews on the more reputable sights.  It was intentionally polarizing.  Rational people are ripping into it because they turned a power hungry monster responsible for the slave trade and a fair amount of ethnic cleansing into an anti-slavery hero.  It was a monumental rewrite of history from start to finish, one so extreme you can't even give it the excuse of artistic license. \r\n\r\nAnd it was intentional, there were a lot of other people that you could make a heroic movie about that fit the mold they were looking for to push meh message.  But they chose this one because the point wasn't to praise the historical figure, the point was to praise the total rewrite of history.\r\n\r\nAnd make no mistake, that is the reason for the positive reviews.  They don't care that it's a cheap poorly written over-acted political propaganda flick, they are praising the fact that they blatantly and knowingly rewrote history, and then turned around and said \"we don't care, it's rewritten now, we have changed reality and, guess what, all of our goose stepping followers don't care either.\"", "**Bodies Bodies Bodies is filled with neurotic, selfish, and annoying characters that find a way to make a killer in their midst aggravating and tiresome.**\r\n\r\nI spent the entire runtime of Bodies Bodies Bodies wondering why this movie was so well received and highly rated. The plot doesn\u2019t kick in until around halfway through, and the audience is left to endure young 20-somethings complaining, making out, and wondering why the world didn\u2019t revolve around them for 45 minutes. The weak dialogue is dreadful to the point of making me wonder if any of it was actually written or just ad-libbed. Unfortunately, once the bodies start dropping, even the mystery of a vicious murderer plays the background to the self-absorbed spoiled brats whining and spilling each other\u2019s secrets. At one point, the story attempts to shoehorn the murderer killing the victims in the order of the game, but even the characters in the movie don\u2019t buy it. The cast does a convincing job of portraying a bunch of immature narcissists reacting to such a high-stress situation. I was so bored and disappointed until the final 3 minutes. The final twist is unique and entertaining but wasn\u2019t worth the trash that had to be tolerated for an hour and a half to get there.", "I was excited, but didn't have much expectations for a PG-13 horror movie. But this was a surprisingly good horror flick. Though the majority of the film's slasher moments are near the end, the story's introduction and setup were surprisingly engaging. Watching the creation of M3GAN and the development of her relationship with the characters in the story was a great way of anticipating the moment she would take matters into her own hands. \r\nMy only problem is that I wanted to see more. Overall, surprisingly solid for a PG-13 horror movie. 9/10.", "Medieval? Mediocre.\r\n\r\nThere is a grand tale to be told about the historic Jan \u017di\u017eka, his times and all that goes with it - the social, religious, political atmosphere, the power-play, the backstabbing, the wars.\r\n\r\nAnd parts of this tale have been told well.\r\n\r\nBut not in this movie. It has good actors, wonderful locations, competent crew, and the biggest budget a Czech movie ever had so far - but it fails. The overall dramaturgy, the pacing, the direction and even the cut fail. This movie has many troubles, and the script is at the core of them.\r\n\r\nThe start is promising - it introduces us into the situation, where no-one is \"good\"; Zizka and his mercenaries are for hire, and who is your enemy today can be your comrade tomorrow. The powerful keep changing sides, nothing is certain, except for the low-born will be suffering either way.\r\n\r\nBut where to go from here? There could have been a wild romp through many of the stations of Zizka's life. Or it could have been a character study, how Zizka came to be the Czech national hero he is. But the movie fails to do that, too - it also burdens us with an unnecessary (and most likely a-historical) love story, and draws out things for long, long, long.\r\nThe battles appear fierce, close up, bloody; if you don't look close, it gives the rough impression of good fighting scenes.\r\n\r\nToo many cliches, too many wide-eyed pained looks from the good lady, and TOO MUCH TIME WASTED.\r\n\r\nThis bit could've been told in a quarter of the time, without skipping anything - and we'd get to see much more of the Czech history (plus more battles, intrigues, and if unavoidable, also love stories).\r\n\r\n**TL;DR: A waste of talent, money, and time.** No need to waste yours, unless you have an lazy time to while away.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: The few token PoC they have to squeeze in these days have been cast as Cumars, plus some vaguely asian-mongolian looking extras. The actual Cumars were from Turkey, but fair-skinned and -haired, and known (as well named) for this aspect of their appearance. But mooks are mooks, right?", "This is one of the better \u201cquiet\u201d movies, as I call them, that I have watched in a long time. Bill Nighy seems to excel in restrained roles, where he speaks quietly and shows emotion subtly. I am thinking especially of The Girl in the Cafe, where he oddly enough also plays a civil servant.\r\n\r\nNighy is wonderful and methodical (in a good way) as a man who is thawing out from a repetitious, paralyzed life after he receives life-altering news. He even impresses when he sings a song in the same quiet, restrained manner.\r\n\r\nA flashback is applied in an odd way nearer the end of the movie, but it works as an imaginative way to fill in the details of the ending.\r\n\r\nI fully expect to watch this again.", "Chadwick Boseman is undeniably missed, but <em>'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'</em> still manages to produce an entertaining and even touching final chapter of the MCU's Phase Four.\r\n\r\nI had a positive time with this, one good thing about watching it almost two months after release is that I got to watch this in an empty cinema - absolute bliss. Thankfully I managed to avoid all spoilers, though had heard the name Namor bandied about online so that's all I knew coming into it.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Namor, I'm a fan. He makes for a cool new character to the universe, as does Talokan as a whole, with Tenoch Huerta a welcomed addition to the cast - first time I recall seeing him in something, and I'm impressed. The star of this 2022 flick, however, is Letitia Wright. I don't really remember her standing out in the original much, at least to me, but here Wright is excellent.\r\n\r\nAngela Bassett is very good also, there's one emotion-filled speech scene in particular that stands out in my memory. Danai Gurira is always a joy to watch, while Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o are the best of the rest - though, the whole cast are good; even Martin Freeman, who I'm not always convinced by.\r\n\r\nThe film handles Boseman's absence nicely, there are some very touching moments in there. I'd say they went the correct way with the character of T'Challa, no-one would've been able to even closely replicate Boseman. The music, meanwhile, is pleasant.\r\n\r\nI do think this has some relatively minor pacing issues, mainly around the midway point, but other than that I felt more than satisified with what I had just watched when leaving the cinema.

This is some repugnant crap and if I didn't know better, I would think that they were trying to go full Blazing Saddles and spoof racism.... but alas, it is Disney, and Disney is woke, the racism here isn't satirizing the subject, it's embracing it in all it's evil glory.\r\n\r\nLet's start with how they castrated Namor and then move on to utterly and completely they stereotyped Latinos, right down to focusing on how wet his back is and beating him by drying off his wet back.\r\n\r\nAs if that wasn't racist enough it goes on to make it's prideful support of Black Nationalism clearly stated, the opposite of which we call White Nationalism, which is very much the purview of groups like the Neo-Nazis, KKK, and other hate groups.  Wakanda Forever has done an excellent job of embracing that same ideology for the Black people of the world... and claiming it as a sort of pride.\r\n\r\nAnd that, of course, is exemplified by their virtuous victory over the forces of... Latino, who are so overtly masculine, right down to their shameful gendered language (like about 90% of the other languages on the globe) that they had to edit out Namor's bulge in order to... what... show more African Racial Superiority over the Latino population, or maybe just to add corporate feminism to the Black Nationalist message.\r\n\r\nEither way, the statement they made here was clear, Latinos bad, Black Nationalism good...\r\n\r\n... God I can't wait until racism is something that is shunned across the board again, because the people who like this crap deserve all the respect we give to the people that loved the original Birth of a Nation and rode around the south wearing sheets on their heads.\r\n\r\nI expected a healthy dose of Black Nationalism when I walked in, I even expected the in your face male-hating... but I thought the racism was going to be directed at people like me, you know, white people.

I do not think any individual part of this film was inherently bad. The performances by Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton were captivating and their on-screen chemistry was amazing. The flash backs to the characters' lives were very fascinating. I really enjoyed exploring the lives of ancient civilizations in the eyes of George Miller. The overarching plot was decent, nothing spectacular. But the collection of all these different elements together just felt like a jumbled mess. The movie never gets in a groove and always feels like it is stumbling its way to the finish line. I felt the opening sequence was incredibly rushed and the audience does not really get to form a connection with Alithea before she unleashes the Djinn, and from there on the audience is whipped back and forth from flashback to present day and it feels incredibly disjointed. The jumbled up second act, deflates any type of momentum going into the third making it fall flat on its head. All this compiled together made a somewhat emotional and touching ending feel hollow and lackluster. Overall, as a collection of short stories this movie was a good time, but really does not belong together in a jumbled-up mess of a plot.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _53%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Average_", "By January 2022, the book had sold 12 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.

(Although one reader thought the movie had a more definitive ending than the book.) Their ratings were 8s, 8.5s and two 10s.

And there is a wonderful contrast between a purity of soul living within a world of threat and danger. It was refreshing to have a film celebrate innocence. The nature shots of North Carolina are breathtaking. The casting is spot on and the performances are flawless. But the success of the film lies with the lead actor, Daisy Edgar-Jones (a very talented Brit, who earned respect for her talents in another best selling novel adaptation for television, NORMAL PEOPLE). There is a wide eyed innocence about Kya that she captures which, in turn, captivates the audience to invest in her story and her plight. (The only disconnect I had with her portrayal was not her fault but that of the production. For a swamp girl, living off the grid, her personal hygiene and wardrobe were spotless and fitted to perfection. A seemingly unlikely possibility considering her environment.)

I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed.

First announced in 2014 and released in mid-2023, it is arguably one of the worst DC movies to this date. Throughout all the problems, the most incomprehensible is certainly how Warner kept allowing such a person as Ezra Miller to be cast as the main role to be the face of a hero. With a budget of $200 million they were able to deliver the worst possible CGI ever seen, and with it a crumbled plot that wishes for more of everything but Flash. \r\n\r\nMichael Keaton has done a brilliant performance within this movie as a throwback to the 89's Batman. And with it, the new addition to the Justice League, Sasha Calle has done a fantastic job as Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), but both get rushed plot points that makes the audience wish for more of their screen time or even a solo movie and not the teenage nuisance that Barry Allen is. One minute, Supergirl rushes out ignoring everything, the other she's at the door regretting her decision and trying to help the rest of the characters. The same can be said about Michael Keaton's character.\r\n\r\nThe movie dives into the concept of time and its dangerous potential, later forgetting everything about it and labeling it \"multiverse\" instead, following Marvel's recent movies like _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_ and _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ and not adding a single spark of creativity with it. But those movies at least have decent scores, the music within this one must have been selected from a random kid's playlist...\r\nThe movie is also 2h 24m long, being completely unnecessary. Various scenes are completly descartable, an action scene at the start was put there with no thought whatsoever and is 15m of wasted narrative that could be used to invest in Supergirl's story (if she is here to stay).

And for some reason they decided to make a bunch of cameos using CGI, and as previously said, that didn't go well.\r\n\r\nIn the end, DC is still the same mess. They can't properly build a plot and create a movie that sustains its own beliefs. Ben Affleck's Batman, at the start, said we can't change our past due to the fact that those key moments that leave scars are the moments that build our foundation and make us who we are. It seems that Barry Allen didn't learn shit from this two-hour journey.", "The Flash utilises a tried and true concept, that of time travel and its paradoxes but doesn't really deliver anything of consequence. \r\n\r\nThis film doesn't deliver for a variety of reasons. To my mind, the foremost is the lead character. The Flash's over cooked dripiness, unfunny, goofy antics and fall flat humour, can't quite \"sell\" the concept of him as a hero. If the films producers and writers, wanted to know how to develop a more accessible lead character, they should have looked at the series. It does a much better job at balancing the characters innate nerdiness, with his other, more heroic, qualities. \r\n\r\nThe second point of failure is essentially re-inventing elements of the story from the series and past films. Flash fans who have watched the series, may well find the film adaptation somewhat repetitive and predictable. Equally recycling large swatches of past films, with tweaks here and there, isn't doing anything that \"new\" either.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only real point of interest is utilising a range of past actors and characters, from the franchise, such as Batman, Superman/woman and Wonder Woman. \r\n\r\nIn summary, not an awful film but still a little unoriginal. An outcome not helped by a rather annoying, lead character. This is balanced by decent action and the presence of other hero's from the franchise. That said, the fact its necessary to drop so many cameo's, is telling in and of, itself.", "Come all, let's witness an amazing adventure of action, adventure and sci-fi in the movie \"The Flash\" which will be released on June 16, 2023 in the United States. This movie follows the story of Barry Allen, who when trying to save his family unintentionally changes the future and becomes trapped in a reality where General Zod has appeared and there are no superheroes to turn to. To save the world and return to the future he knows, Barry's only hope is to race for his life. But will the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the entire universe?\r\n\r\nThe movie is perfect for movie lovers who are looking for an exciting and suspenseful experience. The film features a talented ensemble cast led by Ezra Miller, Sasha Kali, Michael Keaton and Michael Shannon, which enhance the power of the performance and draw the viewers in with their outstanding performances.\r\n\r\n\"The Flash\" enjoys a large budget and wide public appreciation, with a cost of $ 190 million, and revenues of $ 267 million, 481 thousand and 43 dollars. This reflects the success of the film and its positive impact on the audience.\r\n\r\nUltimately, \"The Flash\" combines the powerful elements of action-adventure and sci-fi, while delivering a poignant story about sacrifice for the greater good. So, I invite you to watch this wonderful movie and enjoy an exceptional cinematic experience full of action and suspense.\r\n", "I fear I may be turning into some sort of DC fanboy because... I thought this was great.\r\n\r\nLike with <em>'Shazam! Fury of the Gods'</em>, I was not expecting much from these DCEU films as I only decided to watch them so I could catch up on this universe before the <em>'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'</em> finale next month. I guess I was subconsciously anticipating these to be as flat as a pancake due to the suits upstairs focusing on the upcoming DCU. Yet, I've had a terrific time thus far - <em>'Blue Beetle'</em> pending.\r\n\r\nAs for this film itself, I'm not someone who has any interest in comic books so my only knowledge comes directly from the films. All I knew beforehand was the rather dodgy life of Ezra Miller (just look at their Wikipedia!) apparently affecting production. That's a lot of words to simply say that I have no clue how well of an adaptation this is from the comics, though simply as a film it give me entertainment, it really did.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Flash'</em> features a strong performance from Miller, who portrays the aforementioned with quality throughout. I don't remember Barry Allen from the other DCEU flicks, so I'm pleased to have something memorable from the character with this. Elsewhere, Sasha Calle is very good as Supergirl, while Michael Keaton is much fun as Batman. There are some solid cameos in there too.\r\n\r\nI will say that I personally would've shaved some of the run time, it does overrun ever so slighty. That is my only proper criticism though, given everything else from the story - which brings heart - to the special effects to whatever is done to a positive standard. Rating-wise, I've gone back and forth between 8/10 and 9/10 - it narrowly nabs the latter.", "Very middle ground horror movie. The CGI Dracula is pretty boring throughout.

His daughter (Ally Ioannides) brings home a hippie \u201cJesus freak\u201d (Jonathan Roumie) and he sees that he\u2019s genuine and gifted. The team-up sparks a movement that spreads for the next several years.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus Revolution\u201d (2023) is a well-done account of the Jesus Movement in SoCal between 1968-1971. It\u2019s made in such a way that anyone who\u2019s interested in that era and the social upheaval that was going on will appreciate it, similar to \"Forrest Gump\" except with more overt spirituality. For instance, there\u2019s Janis Joplin, Timothy Leary and several iconic songs, e.g. \u201cFree Ride,\u201d \u201cListen to the Music\u201d and \u201cWar.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m somewhat familiar with Greg Laurie and his ministry, I wasn\u2019t aware that he got his start in the Jesus Movement, nor was I familiar with Chuck Smith or Lonnie Frisbee, the latter of whom \u201cbackslid\u201d and died of AIDS at the premature age of 43 in 1993.\r\n\r\nGrammer and Joel Courtney are effective as the main male protagonists, Chuck Smith and Greg Laurie respectively.

Fury of the Gods is *almost* saved by the incredibly charismatic, energetic cast, as well as by a truly thrilling third act. Unfortunately, the movie falls into the trap of exaggerating what worked in the original, excessively tackling every narrative aspect, and losing authenticity along the way. Way too long, boringly generic, and lacking a clearer direction, namely in the treatment of its family themes. Comedy is far from the efficiency of its predecessor. I recommend it to the vast majority of fans of the genre, who will certainly enjoy the lightness still present in this sequel.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C", "The movie is decent enough, although formulaic and predictable.  But the 12 year old level humor has long since worn out its welcome.", "I genuinely had a blast with this!\r\n\r\nI also had much fun with the original 2019 <em>'Shazam!'</em> so I guess the aforementioned isn't too much of a surprise, though I actually think this as entertaining in differing ways... and I'd class it as an improvement. The first film is more funny, though the story and characters are more interesting here in my opinion.\r\n\r\nBig fan of the special effects throughout, the whole look of film in general is pleasant and I like how bright it all is for the vast majority; as opposed to the dreary darkness that superhero flicks seemingly tend to bring, especially in the DCEU. The score is excellent, not necessarily one I'd add to my movie soundtrack playlist but with the context of what's onscreen it's great.\r\n\r\nThe cast bring noteworthy performances. I wouldn't actually put anyone as a true standout, naturally Zachary Levi sticks out most but as a bunch of characters I had an enjoyable time watching them all in truth. It's fun seeing Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu in their respective roles, while Rachel Zegler is a positive addition and Djimon Hounsou is pleasing. Jack Dylan Grazer spearheads the rest of them well.\r\n\r\nThe only real criticism I have is a couple of bits of dialogue, namely the product placement ones... that certain sweet brand and its slogan in particular. Otherwise, I can only say I found a lot of enjoyment with <em>'Shazam! Fury of the Gods'</em>... my favourite flick from this universe, though a quick glance at the average rating suggests I should whisper that quietly!", "I guess a plus on this sequel is it is better than the first one. Not that says much as I didn't really care for it, as it was a sludge to sit through, especially the finale. Here, honestly I couldn't really understand what the heck was going on but I suppose some of the direction was interesting and it didn't feel like it dragged on. That said, it is empty on any emotional elements.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I even like \"The Conjuring Universe\" is because of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, even the mediocre \"The Devil Made Me Do It\" was watchable because of them, all of these other entries have been mostly duds. **2.5/5**", "Now I don't know about you, but if I started to get text messages from an unknown number that were emotionally revealing in nature, I think that I would politely inform the sender that they'd got a wrong number! Not so here, when the rather hapless \"Rob\" (Sam Heughan) starts to get messages that certainly tweak his interest, and that of his colleagues \"Lisa\" (Lydia West) and \"Billy\" (Russell Tovey). He is able to glean enough from her texts to eventually engineer a meeting (at the opera) and is soon introduced to \"Mira\" (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) who is still reeling from the death of her previous boyfriend in an auto accident - hence why she still thinks she is talking to him when sending messages to his old, now reallocated, phone number! Meantime, \"Rob\" has been tasked with getting an in-depth interview with the soon-to-tour Celine Dion and after a rather shaky start at a press conference, she decides to help our dippy hero to sort out his rather curiously developing relationship. To be fair to Heughan, he's not your archetypal pretty boy in this film, but that's only of slight benefit as the plot lurches from ridiculous to absurd before concluding in the only way it could (just ninety minutes later than it needed to be). The soundtrack does offer us a chance to recall just how powerful Miss Dion's voice is, but her acting ought to be something she consigns to the back of her sock drawer pretty sharpish - a recommendation that could be made for pretty much the entire cast (and the pretty lame writing, too). The only redeeming scene, I felt anyway, featured an health-obsessed Nick Jonas as her date who, upon realising that he wasn't going to get laid, starts to look for an alternative partner with whom to burn off the carbs from the drinks - while they are still in the cab! Nothing at all to write home about here, it passes the time amiably and forgettably enough but definitely does not need the cinema experience.", "Infinity Pool is a horny, horrifying look at ego and self-indulgence based on self-doubt and failure. The film follows novelist James Foster (Alexander Skarsgard) as he is mesmerized by Gabi (Mia Goth) resulting in a stained week of violence and debauchery. \r\n\r\nThe plot is a story of two halves, the first being incredibly strong as the audience is learning the mystery behind the experiments, guests and their past. Viewers can resonate a ton with Foster's wife as she is constantly neglected and misused by her husband. That is ever apparent in the shot selection as she is constantly out of frame or unfocused. This part really worked for me, but as the story progressed the scope grew too large for its own good. The ending becomes unfocused, resulting in aspects that do not make sense or are incredibly unbelievable in the world that the film has set up.\r\n\r\nThe film has fantastic cinematography though, filled with interesting visuals that create for a very unique and chaotic viewing experience. Every shot is calculated and filmed in an interesting way that creates suspense and uncomfortable feelings.\r\n\r\nThe performances are superb, Mia Goth has found her niche in the \"elevated\" horror genre becoming a modern-day scream queen. Although, after X, Pearl, and now Infinity Pool, I would like to see her do some more diverse work, but she has nailed this type of character. Alexander Skarsgard is also great with some emotionally engrossing scenes mixed with cold, emotionless scenes that create an interesting dichotomy for the characters headspace.\r\n\r\nAlthough the film slightly stumbles towards the end and might have a bit of a bloated run time, there is still a ton to enjoy with a creative story, mind bending cinematography, and powerhouse performances.\r\n\r\nScore: 77%\r\nVerdict: Great", "_Infinity Pool_ is an eccentric sci-fi horror filled with disturbing sex, crazy amounts of ultra-violence, and a sequence where Mia Goth breastfeeds Alexander Skarsgard.

The movie follows a storyline that is similar to The Purge, but with a twist. In this movie, there are no consequences for the wealthy elite, which is a unique and thought-provoking concept.\r\n\r\nHowever, the movie loses its way quickly, and the storyline becomes too bizarre for its own good. The events that unfold towards the end are confusing, and there seems to be no clear message to take away from them.\r\n\r\nThe actors' performances are commendable, and the production values are excellent. The visual effects and cinematography are well-executed, but unfortunately, they cannot compensate for the muddled and confusing storyline.\r\nOverall, Infinity Pool is an interesting idea, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.

If you\u2019re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren\u2019t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise\u2019s highest body count in its wake.\r\n\r\nAfter being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.\r\n\r\nThis is Reeves\u2019 movie through and through, and he\u2019s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It\u2019s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) breathes fresh life into the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you\u2019re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It\u2019s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.\r\n\r\nDirector Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn\u2019t a film with rapid cutting where you can\u2019t tell what is going on, and it\u2019s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski\u2019s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.\r\n\r\nDespite all of the things that are done right, the film\u2019s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest.

From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\r\n\r\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see.

And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta\u2019s third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn\u2019t have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren\u2019t adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren\u2019t explained at all, leaving viewers who aren\u2019t comic book laureates wondering what\u2019s going on (particularly at film\u2019s end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn\u2019t particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture\u2019s pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that\u2019s growing tiresome in the studio\u2019s releases, a development akin to the \u201cPaul is dead\u201d legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there\u2019s the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they\u2019ve been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering.

In short, \u201cThe Marvels\u201d is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that\u2019s troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren\u2019t to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they\u2019re cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like \u201cWakanda Forever\u201d (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work \u2013 and it\u2019s time to show viewers that.", "A trashtastic conclusion to an epic failure of a series of movies.

There were so many new folds in technology that were used in the film based on a younger character's perspective and technological innovations since 2018. The editing was fantastic with some very creative mashups of different apps in certain montages. While the acting is not as good as the original, mainly due to the absence of John Cho, everyone does enough to maintain a sense of believability in the plot. This film for me was much more gripping than the original, the pace and tension was amped up creating a very streamlined viewing experience. I looked at my phone thinking the movie was only 30 minutes in, and it was over an hour, it flew by.

Give it a go; easily one of the best movies of this year.", "Aneesh Chaganty made an immediate impact with his 2018 feature debut Searching. While the Google alumnus was not the first to use the screen life format (that is, telling a story only through what we can see on computer screens and digital devices), Chaganty certainly popularized it with a compelling story of a father looking for his missing daughter.\r\n\r\nIn 2023\u2019s Missing, Chaganty produces and gets a \u2018story by\u2019 credit but hands the screenwriting and directing to Will Merrick and Nick Johnson. This spiritual follow-up to Searching again revolves around someone who vanishes. The roles get reversed in Missing, replacing a parent who has to fumble his way around social media as the primary searcher with the very tech-savvy June Allen (Storm Reid), a teen who is looking for her missing mother, Grace (Nia Long).\r\n\r\nWhile Aneesh Chaganty isn\u2019t at the helm this time around, his influence is still very apparent in Missing. We don\u2019t see June all that often, but as in Searching, we get a sense of what the character is feeling when we watch her type a message in a chat box but doesn\u2019t send it, letting the cursor blink for a few moments before erasing the text and typing a revised message that\u2019s more thoughtful. Anyone who has used computers would be able to relate to moments like these where we write off the top of our heads, sometimes in a very emotional state, only to catch ourselves and think better of what we\u2019ve said. In lieu of seeing facial expressions or hearing line readings, this approach to conveying emotion and giving insight into a character\u2019s thoughts is one of the keys to a screen life narrative, giving the story a beating heart when it could easily lean too much into the technical side and become cold and soulless.\r\n\r\nAnother wrinkle that Merrick and Johnson\u2019s film introduces is the lack of money for the protagonist. Being a high schooler, June doesn\u2019t have much in the way of financial resources and is entirely dependent on the money her mother left prior to going down to Colombia on vacation. This presents a challenge when the FBI\u2019s investigation into Grace\u2019s disappearance doesn\u2019t make enough headway for June, forcing her to hire someone down in Colombia to help find clues.\r\n\r\nWith June\u2019s limited funds, she isn\u2019t able to hire a private investigator and is only able to afford the services of Javier (Joaquim de Almeida), an online platform worker. The inclusion of this character grounds the story as Javier is the type of ordinary person one would expect to come across in today\u2019s gig economy. Being a father himself, Javier connects with June, understanding her desperation to locate her missing mother. The burgeoning relationship between Javier and June is one of the highlights of this film, helping to build the emotional resonance that the story needs to keep viewers engaged.\r\n\r\nWith the twists in the narrative and rock-solid performances from Reid and de Almeida, Missing is one of the rare films that manages to equal the trailblazer that came before. Merrick and Johnson\u2019s movie doesn\u2019t have the novelty of Searching, but their take on an online missing person search changes enough elements to make it feel fresh. This film is a great ride and anyone who enjoyed Searching should give it a look.", "I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.\r\n\r\nThe overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.\r\n\r\nThe performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.\r\n\r\nFinally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.\r\n\r\nScore: 52% |\r\nVerdict: Average", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-review\r\n\r\n\"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania warrants the divisive reception. Immersive visuals, more than satisfying action, and absolutely exceptional performances, aside from Kathryn Newton due to lack of direction. Unfortunately, the excessive, repetitive, unnecessary dialogue driven by exposition, along with a lack of stronger tonal balance - fewer jokes by Marvel standard, but the cringe level affects transitions to/from more serious moments - and an underdeveloped narrative devoid of true stakes - character arcs are almost non-existent - make this an overall very inconsistent watch. Still, JONATHAN MAJORS AS KANG! Wow!\"\r\n\r\nRating: C", "A fun one!\r\n\r\nI had a terrific time watching <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'</em>, despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.\r\n\r\nStar of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em>, but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.\r\n\r\nLove the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M.O.D.O.K. is a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nLooking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.", "worst movie. Even that much money - too much btw - for special effects cant hide Reed's lacking effort to build a believable world. It's a poor and passionless visual copy of something like Star Wars Mini... with minimal humor and zero originality. RIP Marvel.", "When it comes to their Marvel properties, there\u2019s this slightly morbid insistence by Disney to tie every teeny tiny detail of previous movies, television shows, and character arcs together in obsessive fashion. It\u2019s becoming such an uncontrollable urge by the studio to engage in this behavior that the cause-and-effect is resulting in disasters like \u201cEternals,\u201d \u201cThor: Love and Thunder,\u201d and now, \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d\r\n\r\nTrying too hard to force a non-story into the already lame Ant-Man mythology, the film reunites superhero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as Ant-Man and the Wasp. The pair find themselves thrust into the dangerous Quantum Realm along with Hope\u2019s parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with Scott\u2019s teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). As they explore the unusual terrain and alien society filled with strange creatures, Janet reveals that she didn\u2019t quite tell the group everything about the three decades she spent trapped in the realm. Facing new dangers from supervillan Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), the family must unite to stop a worldwide disaster.\r\n\r\nVery little about this project feels like a satisfying superhero movie and instead, it\u2019s more like an assemblage of other (and far better) science fiction films. If not for the titanic budget and big-name stars, it could almost be mistaken for a Redbox \u201cmockbuster\u201d of \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cMad Max,\u201d \u201cAvatar,\u201d and \u201cGodzilla\u201d combined.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place extensively in the Quantum Realm, which provides an unsightly setting of muted, dark brown, washed-out visuals. It\u2019s an ugly place, so who why would audiences want to spend time there? The Realm is a melting pot of exotic creatures and peculiar inhabitants that appear to have waltzed right out of the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine. They\u2019re cool to look at I guess, but was the point to make the film more appealing to children, or was it Disney\u2019s way of appeasing the animators by letting them have some fun?\r\n\r\nThe first third of the film seems like it\u2019s Janet\u2019s show, as she keeps bringing up the fact that she has all these secrets that she won\u2019t spill to Hope and Hank (even though they\u2019re all stuck in the Realm together). There\u2019s no compelling mystery nor reveal. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness is grasping at straws to craft a somewhat cohesive story while also struggling to make it fit into the MCU mythology. At some point, I wish someone would just make a damn standalone Marvel superhero movie and quit worrying about who and what goes where and how.\r\n\r\nThe story is frequently erratic. There\u2019s plenty of energetic CGI action, but there also some moments that play like a touching family drama, some that create an anti-climatic post-apocalyptic narrative, and lots of failed attempts at comic relief. The film also has recurring (and awkward) socially conscious messaging that doesn\u2019t entirely feel out of place, but it is aggressive (there\u2019s even a direct mention of socialism by one of the characters, which will really aggravate already-angry conservatives).\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is peppered with dreadful one-liners like \u201cit\u2019s never too late to stop being a dick!\u201d and \u201cants don\u2019t give up!\u201d I really, really wish I was joking about this.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the movie features a lot of talk about time, the desire to get home, and \u2014 Marvel fans, you know what\u2019s coming \u2014 the multiverse! It\u2019s that one little word that means endless movies, endless stories, and endless money. It\u2019s also the easy way to guarantee that all of these films in the canon always have a cop-out to lazily excuse away any inconsistencies (not that many of us could keep up or remember anyway).\r\n\r\nAnother major problem with the film is that it can only chug along on Rudd\u2019s likeability (and the cast\u2019s talent) for so long. It\u2019s barely tolerable until Kang shows up, but he\u2019s a wickedly delicious character portrayed by a terrific actor (it\u2019s a real shame that this had to be the film for Majors\u2019 MCU debut). In fact, the entire cast deserves better. Despite all of them turning in strong performances, they still feel mostly wasted here.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\u201d lacks the memorable spectacle that most superhero films need in order to succeed. There\u2019s no massively rousing, crowd-pleasing moment, and it\u2019s one of the more unremarkable entries in the MCU.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS**", "Honestly this is easily my favorite out of the series. Still funny as normal but there's a lot more action and cool looking stuff in this movie. Really good movie.", "This one was quite good actually. Marvel is quite a bit of hit and miss lately. It all depends on whether one of the woke retards has gotten their grubby hands on the script or not.\r\n\r\nIt was of course encouraging that the woke \u201ccritics\u201d on the well known rubbish site Rotten Tomatoes declared it rotten while it got a 82% score from the actual audience. Always a good sign for a movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a pure adventure movie meant to entertain the audience. The script is decent and, as usual with a Marvel movie, serves mainly to create a reason for doing action sequences and lots and lots of special effects.\r\n\r\nThe adventure is mixed in with some humor but it is generally okay and not overdone.\r\n\r\nThe scenery in the quantum world is fantastic and the creatures are great ranging from terrifying to quite fun. Bringing in Bill Murray was a nice surprise even though he was a bit of a bad guy and quite short lived.\r\n\r\nThe one character I really didn\u2019t like was Paul Rudd as the Ant-Man. His anti-hero bullshit, reluctance to fight and generally being a douche until he was forced to actually do what was right was really grating on me.\r\n\r\nOverall though this was some well spent two hours.", "While Creed III may not be the best in the franchise, it brings enough creativity and passion to the table to keep the series fresh.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky/Creed franchise is at its best when the villain is just as, if not more, interesting than our protagonist, and that is not more evident than in Creed III. Damien Anderson (expertly played by Jonathan Majors) is a very sympathetic antagonist that has a direct connection with Adonis Creed\u2019s past. This connection is at the forefront of the conflict as Creed tries to reconcile with his past mistakes while also being true to his present self. This back and forth is excellently done and evolves Creed further as a boxer and a man. I really enjoyed this story overall, and while it may not be the most unique script to hit the silver screen, it does enough to differentiate itself from the rest of the Rocky universe, and I can respect that.\r\n\r\nThe acting in this film is excellent, as it has been in previous Creed films. I thought that there might be a hole left by the absence of Sylvester Stallone, but I really did not notice it at all. Michael B. Jordan is able to get the best out of the entire cast, and everyone is better than ever. Tessa Thompson is fantastic; her chemistry with Jordan is incredible. The addition of their daughter creates a very wholesome family dynamic. Jonathan Majors is superb; he is intimidating, tragic, and full of emotion that the audience can genuinely resonate with. His anger is justified, and his portrayal of this angry kid who had his life taken from him is incredibly genuine. He was one of the best parts of the film.\r\n\r\nWith Michael B. Jordan behind the camera, this film has the most unique cinematography in the entire series. Jordan takes some liberties with the material that came before to deliver a modern spin on the boxing genre. Where previous films tried to have a broadcast experience grounded in grit and realism, Creed III turns that on its head, delivering the most stunning action scenes I have ever seen. The anime inspiration is apparent, with slow motion used sparingly but effectively. The finale fight has some very creative choices that create an intimate connection between our two leads that is a great backdrop to not only the fight but the story as a whole.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had an excellent time watching Creed III. Michael B. Jordan had a wonderful directorial debut, creating a film that left me with a huge smile on my face.\r\n\r\nScore: 92% |\r\nVerdict: Excellent", "If not for a trademark over-the-top Nicolas Cage performance and a truly inspired fight scene in an apartment complex, \u201cRenfield\u201d would be a total disaster of a movie. It\u2019s certainly not any good and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone, and the real horror of it all is the way director Chris McKay blows what should have been a slam-dunk premise.\r\n\r\nSet in present day, Renfield (Nicholas Hoult) is the tortured, loyal assistant to Dracula (Cage). He\u2019s served his master for decades, taking care of everything from getting his cape dry cleaned to procuring fresh prey for dinner. After centuries of servitude, Renfield is finally ready to move on and create a life of his own.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is mostly dead in the water, the film\u2019s pacing never feels slow. There\u2019s plenty of entertainment, it\u2019s just not fun enough, outrageous enough, nor twisted enough. The tone is both tongue-in-cheek and sincere, which is not cohesive as a whole. There\u2019s a lot of action that means nothing, and characters like Awkwafina\u2018s police officer that are bland and forgettable.\r\n\r\nThe side plots about a crime family with a ruthless boss (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and her son (Ben Schwartz) that wants Renfield dead is half-baked, and the funny group therapy bits where Dracula\u2019s assistant seeks help for co-dependency and dealing with his raging narcissist of a boss falls flat. The ideas all sound so good on paper, but are poorly executed across the board. That\u2019s why the movie feels so underwhelming.\r\n\r\nCage is by far the best part of this mess, and he is an actor who is born to play Dracula. He hams it up in every scene, and his unhinged take is genuinely scary but also goofy. His manic line delivery and unhinged inflection of such dialogue gems like \u201cHail Satan\u201d is absolute bliss.\r\n\r\nThe blood and gore is over-the-top and mostly used in a humorous manner, but this isn\u2019t for the squeamish. There is graphic throat ripping, spurting blood, and abdomens slit open with internal organs visibly spilling out. McKay doesn\u2019t shy away from the violence (and the makeup and effects are really great), which should at least delight horror fans.\r\n\r\nWith such a great idea for story, it\u2019s a bummer that \u201cRenfield\u201d is disappointing in nearly every way imaginable. You\u2019ll find yourself mourning what it could have been.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "I was not expecting much from Renfield and it pretty much gave me exactly what I was expecting: a mediocre film that was nothing offensive but all too forgettable.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is really all over the place. There are too many subplots and not enough time spent on the actual draw to the film, Dracula. Awkwafina's subplot was half baked and really did not go anywhere. I felt as though her character could have entirely been written out of the film to spend more time on Renfield and Dracula. The comedy is pretty bad. I do not remember laughing one time during the hour-thirty-minute runtime. There were clear jokes that they were trying to set up, but they just did not land for me.\r\n\r\nPerformances were fine. Nicholas Cage was great as Dracula, but unfortunately did not have enough screen time or material to really make a huge impact on the film. Nicholas Holt was good in his role, but again I do not think he had much to work with. Everyone else gave really average performances. Awkwafina plays literally the same style of character as she did in Shang Chi, and it was fine, but nothing that really blew me away.\r\n\r\nThe direction was pretty poor. So many action scenes had a tremendous amount of shaky cam and some weird motion blur type effect that made it really hard to see what was happening. It was brutal, don't get me wrong, and I loved what they attempted to go for, but it really just landed flat. Coming off from John Wick just a few weeks ago, the action direction was apparently bad. The gore was at an extreme, but for the love of God, why did they choose to use CGI blood? The graphics literally looked like something out of a PS2 Mortal Kombat; absolutely terrible. Which is a shame because that mixed with the poor action direction really took me out of every scene when I should have been locked in having a bloody good time.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film is a misstep in what could have been a fun, campy, cult classic. The jumbled screenplay, poor stunt choreography, and terrible effects really hold this movie back from its true potential. There is nothing truly awful that make this a bad movie, just enough there to make it an extremely average experience.\r\n\r\nScore: 44% \u274c\r\nVerdict: Poor", "Raw and ruthless - The Killer by David Fincher is basically a 75% thriller 25% action movie that tells about the daily life of a hired hitman - that makes a mistake on job (this is shown in the first 30 min). Then he and who he cares (a girlfriend in Dominican Republic) will pay the price - but things aren't so easy. It reminded me very much the ecstasy of seeing the fist movie incarnation of 007 by Daniel Craig raw violence and not a snobby agent on a suit. \r\n\r\nHe won't let those whom did he things go impune, so what to do do?

He already have his established style, violent and gritty and The Killer doesn't go far from it. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong - this isn't from the \"another movie\" perspective, by another good movie perspective. Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en, 8mm) wrote the script based on the french comic book 'Le Tueurby\" by the writer Matz and artist Luc Jacamon (2000).\r\n\r\nAction wise, the movie have more scenes of the standard procedures of the \"profession\" that raw action, aside from one chapter, where there is a brutal fight (the movie is divided in chapters btw). Michael Fassbender and the others (I am truly a fan of any movie that Tilda Swinton stars) - are the pieces that make the movie especially the first one, raw, obstinate and methodic while always listening to \"The Smiths\" to keep his mind clean and focus on what to do, to not deviate from the plan. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are few lines of dialog between characters, 90% os the dialog is from Fassbender in first person, on the thoughts in his mind. \r\n\r\nAside from the strange fitting of Morrissey in the music track, we have a minimalistic but sober OST made impeccability by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.

My guess is that the makers have cgi or vision art backgrounds because the only thing well done in this movie are the special effects.", "The best way I can describe this effort is a contemporised, misinterpretation, of Dumas novel. \r\n\r\nIf, like me, you have read The Three Musketeers novel, more than once, you'll find this film largely divorced, from that work. The inconsistencies are glaring. \r\n\r\nThe most obvious is steering this tale away from its focus on the male leads, in favour of not necessarily peripheral but definitely secondary or tertiary, female characters. Yes, in my opinion, its yet another clumsy chance to hoist the flag of feminism. Making female characters relevant to the story, in the modern woke context. Of course, this predictably, unbalances the story. The musketeers, are, nudged into the background, in the own tale. \r\n\r\nThe second point of failure is the age of D'Artagnan, who in past films is typically played by a young male actor because this tale, in a sense, is a coming of age story. That's all swept aside too, quite possibly in service to the feminisation of the story.Instead, he's portrayed by a 33 year old man, incongruously called, \"a boy\". Suffice to say, it all feels rather awkward.\r\n\r\nAre there any redeeming elements to the production? Obviously, the acting is sound, its a strong cast. Money has been spent on sets, settings, fight choreography and more, to try to bring this period in French history, to life.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, so much else is wrong that this film simply feels \"openly fake\", to this reviewer. I do not see it as a loyal expression, of Dumas sterling work. Nor the period, in which it is set.\r\n\r\nIn summary,feminises an essentially masculine tale. Don't believe me, just look at the poster, not to mention the film itself. In my view  there are numerous superior and more accurate, cinematic expressions of Dumas work, on offer.", "Well, they made The Exorcist woke... and oddly Anti-Catholic... and it flopped.\r\n\r\nSeriously, The Pope's Exorcist was better and EVERYONE knew that was going to flop.  I'm going to tell you right now that you should go back and watch the prequel movies because they were better... BOTH of them.\r\n\r\nYou have two little girls, a strong anti-Catholic message, a strong anti-patriarchy message, you know... the usual Hollywood meh messaging (except the Anti-Catholic part, that is a dead horse that hasn't been beaten nearly as much) and, most importantly, the same sequel/reboot/franchise killer that seems to go out of it's way to insult all the fans of the original film...\r\n\r\n... and everyone that helped make it.  Which, honestly, is also a dead horse that's been beaten too much these days.  In fact, insulting the original is sort of a trope these days.\r\n\r\nPeople that actually like Terminator: Dark Fate are going to rave about this one... but everyone else is going to roll their eyes because at the end of the day, it has the exact same boring message as everything else.\r\n\r\nAnd like everything else with that message, everything else from bookend to bookend takes a backseat to it.  Bad dialogue peppered with political lectures.  Bad acting (but let's be honest, they had nothing to work with) and in the end even the demon lacked the sardonic and vulgar wit of the first one.\r\n\r\nBut, hey, if you liked Dark Fate and thought The Rise of Skywalker was better than Empire, this movie is for you.\r\n\r\nBut everyone else has seen it before and is tired of it.", "\"Angela\" (Lidya Jewett) and her school mate \"Katherine\" (Olivia O'Neill) go for a walk in the woods one day.

Luckily, the girls turn up in a cow-barn a few miles away but have no recollection of just what they had been doing for the three days they had been missing. Anyway, dad \"Victor\" (Leslie Odom Jr.) soon starts to notice some odd behaviour from his previously reasonable daughter and before we know it, she - and her friend - are showing worrying signs of a possession that resonates all too readily with events some fifty years earlier and that finds him seeking the help of \"Chris MacNeil\" (Ellen Burstyn) before the girls are Satanic toast. It's ten minutes shy of two hours long this, and that's about ninety minutes too long. The vast majority of this film is taken up by pointless preamble, family establishment scenarios and unfortunately the acting and writing are really lacklustre too. Burstyn only makes sparing appearances and Odom Jr. ought to just stick to singing. The last ten minutes is slightly better than standard Blumhouse fayre that concludes this completely unnecessary sequel with, admittedly, a couple of not so predicable twists, but still - with very little to make the preceding drudge worth watching. This is a poor relation to the original and should have gone straight to a streamer.", "As the son of parents who were childhood sweethearts/soul mates, I tend to be a sucker for movie romances that address this subject. In this case, however, the only \u201csucker\u201d aspect applies to the money I plunked down to watch this two-hour snoozefest. Writer-director Celine Song\u2019s debut feature has been praised as a masterful piece of filmmaking and one of the best pictures of 2023, but I heartily beg to disagree. When a pair of young, tightly knit Korean friends, Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), part ways from their native Seoul and are later reunited in New York after a 24-year separation, the reunion of these childhood pals provides them with an opportunity to reflect on what might have been. However, their time together consists mostly of a series of overly bloated pregnant pauses, inane dialogue and missed chances to discuss much of anything meaningful, the kinds of scenes that make even the most patient viewers want to yell \u201cGet on with it already!\u201d These \u201cconversations\u201d come nowhere close to matching their joy of their spirited youthful interactions or the heartfelt, substantive talks that later take place between Nora and her husband, Arthur (John Magaro). The result is, quite frankly, a big fat bore that\u2019s trying to be more than it is but never achieves that outcome. Perhaps the biggest problem with this is the film\u2019s truly sincere but decidedly paper thin narrative that doesn\u2019t have the writing support to bring it all into beautiful full bloom, despite some fine performances, exquisite cinematography and an emotive background score. From this, the director would appear to have a hefty reserve of potential stashed away, at least based on this offering\u2019s stylistic elements, but the substance could use some definite shoring up. Let\u2019s hope her next effort lives up to that.", "Wow. For a director, Celine Song, just coming out of the gate, this is quite an impressive film. The lead actress, Greta Lee, fit the role like a soft leather glove, which speaks volumes, both for her talent, and for Song's casting. Lee's Hollywood Critics Association Best Actress award is well-deserved.\r\n\r\nSong wrote an excellent screenplay, and her direction turned it into a stunning film. Kudos to A24 for taking a chance on her. I presume they are happy with the outcome. It's rather interestingly paced in a Buddhist or Asian kind of way - slow, meditative, and more is shown than is said. Overall, it's not a perfect film, but it's close.\r\n\r\nThis isn't precisely a coming-of-age movie, but the plot revolves around that (perhaps even more difficult,) developing period between the ages of 20 and mid-30s. I've held a long-standing belief that our life chapters change every seven years. You know: there are seven chakras, seven days in a week, the Seven Sisters (Pleiades), or whichever mystical seven you'd like. Over the course of three of these \"theoretical\" chapters, this movie focuses on two relationships in the protagonist's life, from roughly twenty-one (7*3) to approximately forty-two (7*6). She was married at about the time of a chapter shift (7*5), as if to validate my weird belief. In my world, it all makes sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie is certainly somewhat autobiographical, even by Song's own admission. It will be added to my Directors About Themselves list. I can't wait to see Celine's next project!", "If you are expecting an Evil Dead movie... well, I guess it depends on what generation you're from.  If you are expecting Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness, the films of the unholy trilogy... you are going to be gravely disappointed.  This isn't Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.\r\n\r\nThis is, well, this is the Conjuring just like almost every other Horror movie past 2014.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really breathe \"new life\" into the franchise, instead it takes the Evil Dead and breathes the PG-13 Neo-Horror Movie breathe into a franchise that used to be a heck of a lot of campy immature fun.  \r\n\r\nHere you get the same as everything else.", "Evil Dead Rise puts a creative spin on the classic franchise while also remaining faithful to the core experience.\r\n\r\nThe story is not overly complex and admittedly somewhat generic, as the main characters find the Book of the Dead, read it, and all hell breaks loose. But the conditions surrounding this plot are what truly set it apart. For one, the high-rise setting was brilliant and created a very claustrophobic environment that worked really well. I found the earthquake to be an original idea not only for the discovery of The Necronomicon but also for the entrapment of our main characters.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of our cast, this film does a really great job of setting up these characters. I genuinely liked all of them, which made it difficult to see some of them go, unlike in Evil Dead (2013). The familiar bond between them was palpable, and this could not have been done without a fantastic cast. Alyssa Sutherland is by far my favorite Deadite in the entire franchise. Her motherly connection was haunting, her facial expressions, and mannerisms are nightmare fuel. Lily Sullivan was genuinely fantastic as a final girl. Her badass nature to defend the children is incredible, and she had some really great moments to stand out in the film. The kids overall did fine, nothing that was too amazing but nothing that took away from the film either.\r\n\r\nThe direction was my favorite part of the film by far. Lee Cronin did such a fantastic job with haunting camera work with subtle tilts and use of reflections. The action was top-notch, and the practical effects were amazing. So many scenes had me physically wincing with some insanely creative violence mixed with stomach-churning blood and wound effects. It is definitely a worthy successor to Evil Dead (2013) in the gore department.\r\n\r\nOverall, this may not be the best in the franchise, but I think it is one of the most refined. The story lacks in some areas, but the direction, performances, and violence really cement this as one of the best horror films of the year.\r\n\r\nScore: 84%  \u2705\r\nVerdict: Great", "As contemporary horror films go, I\u2019ll freely admit that this is a genre about which I couldn\u2019t care less. I find most of these films boring, predictable, stupid and not especially scary. In fact, the only ones to which I\u2019ll even give a second look are smart horror films (like \u201cGet Out\u201d (2017) or \u201cAnnihilation\u201d (2018)) or campy romps (like \u201cRenfield\u201d (2023)). So the fact that I somehow managed to sit through this trash heap is quite an accomplishment. (Actually, the only reason I watched was because I was channel surfing and there was nothing else on, so I decided to give it a chance (I would have been better turning on the radio).) This pointless parade of endless blood and gore is a prime example of the decline of the mainstream movie industry (how projects like this get greenlighted is beyond me, except, of course, for the obvious box office considerations). It\u2019s so utterly ridiculous that the picture plays like something that was made up as the crew went along. I\u2019ll admit that there was some modestly cheeky humor here, but not enough to make it a genuine camp fest. Writer-director Lee Cronin\u2019s latest is an assault on the art of filmmaking, the kind that should carry fines and other punishments.

Unfortunately, it isn't able to escape the narrative formulas of \"humans possessed by demons\" repeated over several decades in this \"subgenre\" of exorcisms. Russell Crowe elevates the movie quite a bit with a well-rounded performance, seamlessly blending the dramatic moments with his character's comedic personality. However, the constant tonal changes create uncertainty about the type of film we're supposed to be watching. Personally, it's a mixed bag...\"\r\n\r\nRating: C+", "An episode of supernatural would've done a better job. Movie was mid at best", "Beau is Afraid certainly boasts an incredibly rich and intricate narrative, filled with a plethora of allegories, symbolisms, and thematic elements. However, one may question whether the complexity of the film is worth sacrificing entertainment value. In attempting to weave together these complex themes, Ari Aster has created a narrative that was very difficult for me to fully process.\r\n\r\nDuring the first hour of the movie, I found myself engrossed in the story, with tense scenes that blurred the lines between what is real and what is fake. However, as the film progressed, these surreal scenes became increasingly wild and disjointed, leaving me feeling disconnected from the narrative. I found myself constantly asking questions about what was happening, how we got there, and why things were unfolding the way they were. This detachment ultimately detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film.\r\n\r\nAt three hours in length, Beau is Afraid can be a daunting task for audiences to undertake. While a well-paced film can fly by (Avatar: The Way of Water and Babylon for instance), this one felt like a slog at times, and I found myself frequently checking the clock to see how much time was left. However, despite these shortcomings, the technical execution of the film was truly exceptional. Aster's direction was brilliant, with stunning camera work and beautiful cinematography. The acting was also top-notch, with Joaquin Phoenix delivering what was arguably the best performance of the year so far. The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan, Patti LuPone, and Nathan Lane, also gave standout performances.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Beau is Afraid was quite a letdown for me. While Aster undoubtedly has a brilliant mind and a talent for storytelling, this film may have suffered from a lack of restraint. Nonetheless, the technical prowess and stellar performances are certainly noteworthy and should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nScore: 41% \u274c\r\nVerdict: Poor", "Zero spoilers in here. \r\n\r\nAbsolutely wonderful. I can't do a big braining on what everything means in this crazy topsy-turvy roller-coaster of a movie, but it's one hell of an entertaining ride if you just sit back and enjoy it. For me, this movie needed to be watched the same way I watched Lost Highway - don't try to understand it, just be open to being frightened and entertained. \r\n\r\nSuffering from generalized anxiety myself, the first part of the movie is absolutely brilliant, showing the world through the lens of someone with a severe case of anxiety. Everything is over the top, and the attention to detail is stunning.\r\n\r\nThe movie devolves further and further into madness, somewhat akin to the way it did in Mother, except not in a frustrating way, but rather an action-packed and crazy, sometimes touching way. Oh, and hilarious. There are such funny moments in this movie, often absurdly so.\r\n\r\nI didn't read up on anything before watching this movie, and I had no idea it was going to be three hours. I didn't know Ari Aster made it, and frankly I didn't know who he was. Looking it up afterwards, I see he made Midsommar, which I found tedious and boring, and Hereditary, which I absolutely loved.\r\n\r\nI can definitely see how someone could hate this movie. I can also sympathize with being frustrated with it if trying to understand everything. I think the best way to watch this is popcorn. Watch this like you'd watch a popcorn flick, except expect absurdities instead of explosions (though we do get explosions here, too). That's how you'll be entertained by this amazing movie. I'll be watching this again.\r\n\r\nOh, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. Absolutely his most impressive performance so far.\r\n\r\nWatch this. It's special. Even if you hate it, you won't regret watching it.", "Not for everyone indeed. But it is A24 and Ari Aster (and yeah I am a fan of his works). It is very difficult to categorize the movie... part thriller, part abstract, part (well mostly) dark comedy. \r\n\r\nWho knows Ari Aster works of before (Hereditary, Midsommar) knows he likes a lot to put abstract, symbolic and allegorical scenes, and pieces of the plot hidden thorough the movie. Beau Wasserman is unique and pitiless. \r\n\r\nThis one is surely one he put a hell of an effort to put things, and make sense in the senseless... and in chaos that is a definition for what I saw, it is pretty crazy as some flicks from the 70's (see Holy Mountain of 73, or Zardoz of 74 and you will get the LSD level of the scenes). Some more recent movies had that WTF moments too, like the middle part of Triangle of Sadness or some parts of White Noise (both of 2022) and you get the level of non-sense and comic all together.\r\n\r\nThe best definition of the Kafkaesqueness of Beau is to pick some work of the dutch painting Hieronymus Bosch of the XV century and try to grab some meaning on it. It is there but not so obvious.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Beau you can see two things: 1-) he is clearly someone with deeply psychological or psychiatric issues and 2-) he has a deep anxiety and FEAR all along the movie in the hope to not let people down or not to be a disappointment to anybody even he is clearly being it already in his mind. It is on the title of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe most \"normal\" scenes in the movie are the ones in the start of the movie in the psychiatrist bed (the ones that he must have with lot's of water - I don't know if it is a joke or not but Wass in german means \"water\" and element that is present since the beginning of the movie). \r\n\r\nIt must be interesting to see Aster working in his works, because neither one is simple, all are complex and relates to parts that we seen before. His passion for his work makes him one of the directors I admire at the most. Some people don't like him - the same way some people don't like Lars von Trier works. It is a matter of taste, and it is totally normal.\r\n\r\nFor me the story told is all above - don't try to pick what is real and what isn't, because out of the clinic door all is in Beau's head. Fragments of reality and inner issues in a bizarre blender that isn't for everyone.\r\n\r\nI wish I had seen it on the theater there were some scenes that made me laugh a lot and at the same time felt guilty like the one at his attic. \r\n\r\nOn the technical side: Joaquin Phoenix again is a powerhouse in acting (and Academy worthy maybe?), the script is pretty original (well, last year Everything Everywhere All at Once was mostly non-sense but with a sense and won tons of stuff) and the work on editing and art direction are excellent and again long colaborator Pawel Pogorzelski work as cinematography is impeccable.\r\n\r\nI liked the movie, it isn't the best of Ari Aster (and three hours are heavy on most of the cases), but is pretty good: my score is 8,3 out of 10,0 / A -.", "The Wandering Earth II or the \"wandering script\", as I call it, does nothing to improve upon a proposition that failed to work, the first time around.\r\n\r\nIts alright to create a space saga but trying to cram the whole thing down the audiences throat in two sittings, is simply too much to ask. My wife, who is Chinese, became exasperated about half an hour in and I don't blame her. \r\n\r\nThere are simply too many disparate things going on at once, for this film  to present anything, even a highly switched on viewer, like my economist other half, can reasonably follow. \r\n\r\nWhat you are left with, is what amounts to mini films, that feel like little like extended trailers, cobbled together over an lengthy time line, that become so diffuse, as to loose the potential to represent any semblance of a comprehensible \"whole\". \r\n\r\nGraphics are admittedly amazing, as are some of the sci fi conceptualisations. Acting's mostly pretty decent, too. That said, what are these elements without clarity of storytelling?\r\n\r\nIn summary, best described as an overly ambitious, ill considered \"sci fi, hot mess\" that's clearly had a lot of time and money invested in it.

This vapid comedy (from director Catherine Hardwicke) feels like it was crafted by a soccer mom groupthink, with a ridiculous fantasy story that\u2019s struggling to be hip and edgy. It\u2019s a truly terrible movie that\u2019s a complete waste of time for everyone but those who have the absolute lowest of low standards when it comes to their choice of entertainment.\r\n\r\nLike most women, American mom Kristin (Toni Collette) has a lot on her plate. She keeps her home running despite dealing with the double emotional punch of her son going off to college as well as discovering that her cheating husband is having an affair. Things aren\u2019t going so well when she gets a mysterious phone call with a shocking message: she has inherited her grandfather\u2019s mafia empire in Italy. Guided by the firm\u2019s consigliere (Monica Bellucci), Kristin must gain the self-confidence to become the new leader of the (mafia) family business.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the fish-out-of-water premise is a good one. The story outline is fine, but the execution is a debacle. Although they are working within a very broad parameter of mass appeal, the screenwriting trio\u2019s (Amanda Sthers, J. Michael Feldman, and Debbie Jhoon) script feels like a struggle to stay above water. The writing talks down to the audience and narrative includes dumb scenarios that feel like a sad sack\u2019s fantasy (the worst being a hunky local guy (Giulio Corso) who is instantly smitten by Kristin the second she lands in Rome, and the eventual \u201ctwist\u201d that anyone with half a brain can see coming from a mile away). It\u2019s also filled with tired Italian stereotypes and has such a strong desire to be a \u201ccool and different kind of comedy\u201d that it earns an R rating with bloody violence and a bunch of cursing.\r\n\r\nEven worse is Collette\u2019s performance, which is an overblown exercise in desperation and overacting. Her take on the timeworn goofy, gullible American shtick feels like a huge stretch, to the point where her character becomes a weak caricature of a real woman. Kristin is a complete clown, even in a film that is trying (but not exactly succeeding) to tell a story of female empowerment. It\u2019s a tragic waste of Collette\u2019s talent. She is so much better than this.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t think of anything positive to say about \u201cMafia Mamma.\u201d Even your worst enemy deserves better.\r\n**\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREENZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "A completely stupid comedy.\r\nIt could have been an excellent film for having almost all the conditions for it.

There are seven to eight characters introduced throughout the course of the film, with each given significant time to develop their story and motivations. This takes a lot of time away from the main attraction, the cocaine bear. There is a period of almost 45 minutes where we are focused on these \"secondary\" characters, without any action or appearance of the cocaine bear. This section was pretty slow paced and started to lose me, but once the bear is re-introduced, the film gets significantly better. The paramedic scene was superb.\r\n\r\nThe comedy was pretty lackluster as well. The entire theater was laughing aloud, but I found myself only chuckling at a few jokes. This left the script feeling somewhat bland. But the lack of humor is made up for by the absolute brutality on display. There are some really messed up kills that do not shy away from the blood and gore. Some of the effects looked to be prosthetics as well, which always have an especially disgusting appearance to them.\r\n\r\nThe story overall was pretty decent, but the ending was atrocious and incredibly predictable. I found that it was really over the top and cheesy, but not in a good way. \r\n\r\nThe visual appearance of the bear was pretty solid. The CGI was done well but is spotty in a couple of scenes.

I understand with a premise like that, it\u2019s supposed to be stupid. The problem is that the movie isn\u2019t just dumb, it\u2019s actually bad, with poor direction, acting, CGI, writing, and storytelling.\r\n\r\nLoosely based on true events (yes, really), the film is inspired by the 1985 story of a drug runner\u2019s plane crash. In order to save a large quantity of cocaine, the man threw out several duffel bags full of the stuff over Tennessee and then jumped to his death when his parachute didn\u2019t open. A black bear got into the drugs, consumed most of it and, according to experts, immediately died. This movie imagines what could have happened if the bear didn\u2019t die from ingesting all that booger sugar. In this bloody and gory version, the 500 pound apex predator goes bananas and kills everyone in sight.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fictional story that is stretched too thin, especially with the meager subplots about a single mom (Keri Russell), her missing daughter (Brooklynn Prince) and friend (Christian Convery), a group of criminals (Ray Liotta, O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich), two park rangers (Margo Martindale, Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a police detective (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), and random tourists and teenagers that must think on their toes in order to avoid being the bear\u2019s next victim. Jimmy Warden\u2018s script is atrocious because he\u2019s trying to force a story that\u2019s not at all compelling nor complex. The actors give clunky performances and character-wise, there just isn\u2019t a whole lot to root for.\r\n\r\nBanks isn\u2019t the most skilled director, and a film like this certainly doesn\u2019t demand a whole lot of talent behind the camera. But there\u2019s something that consistently feels \u201coff\u201d with her style and tone, especially in the random, mostly unsuccessful jokes. The humor didn\u2019t work for me at all, and when I did muster a laugh, I wasn\u2019t doing so because the movie was good \u2014 I was laughing because the movie was so dumb.

In real-life the black bear weighed 175 lbs, but this was changed to almost 400 lbs for the movie.\r\n\r\nThe production unbelievably cost $35 million. I say \u201cunbelievably\u201d because this is a decidedly throwaway creature feature of the semi-goofy SyFy variety. The CGI is a little superior, but not enough to make any appreciable difference. I\u2019m speaking as someone who enjoys some of the better SyFy flicks on occasion. A good example is \u201cSasquatch Mountain\u201d (2006), aka \u201cDevil on the Mountain,\u201d which only cost $800,000.\r\n\r\nExcept for the lush scenery (shot in Ireland, locations listed below), this is decent but generally meh.

It doesn\u2019t help that Keri is the only female worth mentioning (as a footnote at that).\r\n\r\nHow this garnered as much attention as it did is a great mystery. \u201cGrizzly Park\u201d (2008) treaded similar terrain and, while far from a great movie, is more entertaining than this (at a fraction of the budget). \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot south of Dublin, Ireland, in Barnaslingan, Powerscourt and, further south, Avoca.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-", "I got excited for this one, I mean it's 2023 and Cocaine Bear had the promise of NOT being political.  It had the promise of NOT having meh message.  It had the promise of NOT being serious.\r\n\r\nI mean, the bear was obviously the star.  People were going to see it because they wanted to see a giant bear high on coke killing people in a mindless and humorous way...\r\n\r\n... but.... something happened with the direction.  The humor was clearly there on paper.  That was evident enough, but the delivery was... meh.  The jokes didn't land because they ran too long, the timing was off, everything was there for it to be funny and fun... it just feels like it was made by a director that can't tell a joke.\r\n\r\nAnd it falls on the director, because the writer clearly can.  Everything is there to make it work.  But all the action is predictable and all the jokes are butchered.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of anyone else, this would have been hysterical fun.", "Writer-director Wes Anderson has lost his way, and this film proves it. I realize that the auteur\u2019s signature style of filmmaking is an acquired taste, and, to his credit, he\u2019s made some fine pictures over the years. But this one is not among them. In fact, contrary to many of the inexplicable claims that this is his finest release, I\u2019d contend just the opposite. It\u2019s arguably his worst, a meandering, cryptic, unfocused piece that\u2019s so muddled you\u2019ll need the assistance of a search party to find your way out of it (that is, if you even care by the time the end of this overlong mess rolls around). The director appears to have become so enamored with his own eccentricity that it doesn\u2019t even seem to matter to him whether or not viewers are on the same page as he is. Admittedly, this offering once again captures Anderson\u2019s singularly stylish look with a stunning production design and gorgeous cinematography. But that\u2019s all it has going for it, and that\u2019s unfortunate given the phenomenal cast he has available to him. What\u2019s more, despite his proficiency in creating superb visual style, he\u2019s forgotten about pairing it with meaningful (or even interesting) substance. Its incomprehensibility and inclusion of bits that are there just for the sake of their own whimsy seriously undercut any effort to make this an intelligible work. In short, \u201cAsteroid City\u201d is yet another major disappointment in what is turning out to be a dreadfully dismal summer movie season. It\u2019s likely to appeal only to diehard fans of the director (and maybe not even a lot of them this time out). If you\u2019re on the fence about this one, consider the following two telling tipoffs: (1) when no one in the theater is laughing at what\u2019s been billed as a comedy, that should speak volumes about it (as happened at the screening I attended); and (2) when you consider how aggressively and ubiquitously the distributors have been promoting this film in ads on TV and the internet, it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re trying awfully hard to peddle shabby, substandard merchandise. This is a huge waste of time and money; don\u2019t squander yours.", "Even though the film has a fair share of chuckle worthy moments, _Asteroid City_ shamelessly rolls around in its eccentricities and unapologetic blundering demeanor with no real depth or character development whatsoever. The gathering of extraordinary talent draws you in yet _Asteroid City_ doesn\u2019t deliver a story that\u2019s fully worth telling.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/24/asteroid-city-review-wes-andersons-charmless-comedic-drama/", "Most critics have their personal favorite directors, and it\u2019s sometimes a challenge to keep strict objectivity when reviewing one of their projects. That\u2019s why it pains me to write about \u201cAsteroid City,\u201d the sluggish, smug, exasperating new film from co-writer and director Wes Anderson. In what is unquestionably his worst film by a mile, Anderson leans too heavily on his ordered, signature visual symmetry, saturated color palate, and A-list cast while completely forgetting how to make an entertaining movie.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place in a tiny desert town (famous for their giant crater) where the Junior Stargazers and Space Cadets are holding their awards convention. The event brings together students and their parents, all oddballs in their own right, from all over the country. When a UFO is spotted, the visitors are quarantined until the government deems it safe for them to return to the real world.\r\n\r\nThe plot is thin yet confusing, as the film simultaneously depicts the events of the convention in the form of a stage play, the creation of the play, and the actual events in a retro version of 1955. With so much going on, you\u2019d think it would be at least mildly interesting, but the movie is sluggish and packed with conversational and head-scratching filler that lends nothing to the story.\r\n\r\nThere is a wacky cast of (too many) characters, and only a handful turn out to be memorable. The expected roster of Anderson regulars make an appearance (Jason Schwartzman, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson) as well as big names that are new to working with the director (Bryan Cranston, Tom Hanks, Maya Hawke, Matt Dillon, Steve Carell, Liev Schreiber, Hong Chau, Jake Ryan). It\u2019s a dream of a cast list, but this film goes to show that a talented roster doesn\u2019t always result in a gem. There\u2019s nothing wrong with any of the performances, but it\u2019s the source material that needs a lot of work.\r\n\r\n\u201cAsteroid City\u201d may be visually delightful, but it is filled with a detached, hipster indifference that\u2019s off-putting. This is one of the biggest failures of the year, and it\u2019s not because the film is \u201ctoo Wes Anderson-y,\u201d nor is it because of the general Anderson fatigue: this movie is a series of flagrant missteps that cause the project to flounder and fall.", "Top tongue-in-cheek directors: Wes Anderson and Wen Jiang. Asteroid City isn't my favorite Wes film, but it's surely tongue-in-cheek and pretty damn funny.\r\n\r\nThis movie reminds me a little of Tennessee Williams, the all-time master of damaged and traumatized human psyches. I see this work as a treatise on human issues, especially the labels given to us by others and those we give ourselves, and how they affect one's life and relationships.\r\n\r\nThe partial view of the \"Confessions of a Narcissist\" marquis that showed up in the background of the tet-a-tet between Augie and his almost-onstage-wife is a clue. The term \"narcissist\" didn't become popular psychology until the 1980s. There were other anachronisms, but this one is particularly striking in context.\r\n\r\nAnd what's with that song and dance number in the middle of the show? The band that showed up in this desert had no other raison d'etre!! Did Wes just reference the Time Warp from The Rocky Horror Picture Show??", "There is a void to fill regarding a yearly _Thanksgiving_ franchise. The Carver is outrageous enough to be more enjoyable if Eli Roth allows other directors to play in his grotesque cornbread-stuffing-filled sandbox in future installments. As a standalone film, _Thanksgiving_ leans more into the dumb than it does fun and will likely leave viewers feeling nauseous, especially if they see the film on a belly full of cranberry sauce and chunky gravy. \r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/deathbypilgrim", "**Not sure if it's a good Christian movie, but it's a great horror movie**\r\n\r\nGreat movie, even though in a way it sets itself up for failure, because a Christian audience doesn't usually appreciate a good psychological horror movie and horror fans usually don't like a movie made by Christians promoting Christian values.\r\n\r\nSo there is no big demographic that really appreciates a movie like this and it's obvious that the makers of this movie knew that too and were doing it to simply make a good movie for those who can appreciate it (no matter how few there might be).\r\n\r\nSo I am not sure if it even really wants to be a good Christian movie or a good psychological horror movie, but either way it does succeed at being both.\r\n\r\nFor a movie about demonic possession it's also surprisingly realistic. And I say that as someone who has worked as a guard in prisons and mental institutions. There are a few extremely minor inaccuracies but these are necessary for the plot or are for safety reasons (after all, not everyone needs to know what exactly the actual safety measures in a prison actually look like in detail).\r\n\r\nThere actually already is an almost identical German movie called \"Der Totmacher\" (The Deathmaker). Though I am sure no one involved in this movie saw it, even though it's essentially the same movie and that's because that German movie's entire script simply consists entirely of the actual transcripts of an actual psychological evaluation of an actual serial killer. But that's how close to reality this all actually is.", "EXT. INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF THE LOST DIALS SKULL \u2013 DAY\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is more closely related to its recent sequel than its distant cousins of the original trilogy. It attempts to take the franchise's formula and shake it up; it throws in cameos, call-backs and references but suffers the same issue every recent Lucasfilm movie has. \r\n\r\nIt's another modern Disney reboot sequel with legacy characters left in the dirt, and a 'quirky & quippy' new character is presented to us. You know this character type when in the face of fear, they will make fun of the villain's Lactose Intolerance or something random because this character is flawlessly confident. They are knowledgeable on every subject relevant to the plot, smartasses because they are always correct, sassy when held hostage and always have an escape plan. This is Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridges), and she might be the only consistent character in the film. For the rest of the ensemble, Boyd Holbrooks Klaber speaks once in the movie and then chases after Jones in each scene; Mads Mikkelsens J\u00fcrgen Voller is the most forgettable antagonist of the franchise, Antonio Banderas is out of the film faster than he's in it and finally, Harrison Ford as Dr Jones is unfortunately back for what seems like a pretty good paycheck.\r\n\r\nI have nothing against the performances themselves. The cast is incredibly talented, but this skilled team cannot hide the terrible dialogue reinforcing the rather forgettable story. Ultimately, Indiana Jones has one of the greatest trilogies of films with a distance spin-off universe of sequels. Lucasfilm, post-2008, has not been your era.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT.", "\r\nI really like the Indie series, so I take no pleasure in saying, I found this unwatchable. \r\n\r\nReally US entertainment industry, when are you going to get the message that a lot of us aren't interested in \"the message\".\r\n\r\nIn summary, great cast, great sets, horrible script, full of the usual lecturing no one asked for. ", "_Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_ feels like the type of sequel that aimed to capture the magic of its predecessors, had worthwhile intentions, and a talented cast, but it just never properly materialized. The film seems to teeter on the sheer annoyance of a main character grappling with the fact that he\u2019s now a crotchety and wrinkly senior citizen and not the young, grizzled, adventurer he used to be.\r\n\r\nWith an ending that leaves the Indiana Jones character in a satisfying bookend for the franchise, hopefully _The Dial of Destiny_ is the final Indy film. Like Roger Murtaugh in _Lethal Weapon_, Harrison Ford is literally too old for this sh*t.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/destinysdial", "It took me a while to work up the courage to see this.  I mean, Indiana Jones was my hero as a child.  When I was sick I used to watch Raiders over and over again and that was a tradition I kept up through high school.\r\n\r\nAnd now... Thank you Doomcock, without your intervention this movie would have been even worse.  It shows, the plot is messy, the re-shoots are a little obvious story-wise as Disney did their best to attempt to avoid the fan backlash promised for when their plans were to kill Indy off and have Phoebe replace him....\r\n\r\n... and then when when they re-shoot it again because the fans didn't want to see Indiana Jones be ridiculed constantly by his female replacement in an effort to make the KK stand-in come across as better in every way... and a lot of that is still there in the final product.\r\n\r\nLike Star Wars did to Skywalker, Indiana Jones is constantly shamed by the younger more diverse version... who can't seem to decide what character she wants to be.  Rogue?  Scholar?  Conman? Her personality changes as the script dictates, but Indiana remains pathetic... so that Strong Female Lead can look better.\r\n\r\nIn the end it's a mess, and the result is that Disney killed another fan favorite Franchise.  Star Wars, Willow, and now Indy.  They paid out the nose for all of them and then made them worthless.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of conspiracies floating around about it, but it don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.", "\u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d is a stale, impotent summer blockbuster that marks another unimaginative entry in the popular adventure franchise. Excessively dull and far too long, director James Mangold\u2018s movie burns every last drop of goodwill that\u2019s left in the tank. This fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones saga is a pathetic sendoff to one of the most iconic big screen characters of all time.\r\n\r\nSet in 1969, Daredevil archaeologist Henry \u201cIndiana\u201d Jones (Harrison Ford) is still working as a professor, but today is his retirement day. In his final class, a young woman from his past turns up: his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She\u2019s in search of a mystical device that her father Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) obsessed over until the day he died, and Indy knows its historical significance all too well. It\u2019s been said that the Antikythera (the Greek name for the Dial of Destiny), can alter the course of history and time, and it would turn any person who held it into a god. Soon Indy and Helena find out that former Nazi and current NASA scientist J\u00fcrgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) also wants the device for himself so he can change the outcome of World War II, and it becomes a race against time (and a very dangerous enemy) if they want to save history as the world knows it.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a bad story overall, but it certainly is a mess of one. It\u2019s extremely slow, and the most interesting parts happen in the film\u2019s final 45 minutes. That means there\u2019s an abundance of bland filler and tepid action chase scenes that fill screen time before all the good stuff happens. There\u2019s a lot of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at play here, as Mangold tries to milk fond memories of the earlier (and best) \u201cRaiders\u201d films, and he\u2019s not shy about masking his intentions. The film brings back classic characters like Marion (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who only briefly appear as a means of tugging on the heartstrings (and reminding audiences of far, far better movies).\r\n\r\nThere are so many missteps in this film that it becomes more of a bore than a fun means of escapism. The opening sequence is a little fun, but it\u2019s too reminiscent of the circus train intro in \u201cLast Crusade.\u201d There\u2019s another tuk tuk chase that\u2019s eerily familiar to the mine cars in \u201cTemple of Doom.\u201d The script (which credits four writers) inserts plenty of winks and nudges as it references the most classic Indiana Jones films. While the crack of Indy\u2019s whip and the moment he dons his famous brown fedora may get those feel-good endorphins flowing, it also makes in painfully clear that a movie can only coast so far on nostalgia.\r\n\r\nA large chunk of the problem is (surprisingly) with the character. An archaeologist outsmarting Nazi villains feels more dated in today\u2019s society than it should, even though the film is set in the late \u201960s. Indiana Jones will always be a classic of course, and the studio should be applauded for its decision not to recast Ford in what is in the top two of his most iconic roles. What\u2019s cringey is the use of de-aging software for the scenes that take place in the past, which makes Ford look plastic, fake, and straight out of a Pixar movie. It doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s distracting, and it arguably was unnecessary within the confines of the story the film is trying to tell.\r\n\r\nOne of the positives is that Ford is clearly still a movie star, and he holds the movie together with what appears to be minimal effort. Yes, it\u2019s easy to tell when a stunt person is standing in and it\u2019s obvious through some clever (and choppy) editing that Ford wasn\u2019t personally able to perform all of the physicality the role demanded, but he still lives and breathes Indiana Jones, so much so that after a little bit of time, you don\u2019t even see him as an old man. The addition of Waller-Bridge adds a refreshing spark to the film, and her character and performance are quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d will perform well across generations, but Gen Xers and older audiences will be delighted to see one of their favorite characters back in his own action / adventure story. What a pity this is the best sendoff that could be mustered for Indy after all this time.", "\"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" delivers exactly what fans of the iconic adventurer have been yearning for\u2014a thrilling, action-packed adventure that pays homage to the franchise's rich history while introducing new and captivating elements.\r\n\r\nHarrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones with the same charm and charisma that has made him a beloved cinematic icon for decades. Ford effortlessly slips back into the fedora and whip, proving that age has only added depth to the character. His portrayal is a masterclass in blending wit, humor, and vulnerability, reminding us why Indiana Jones is an enduring hero.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast shines as well, with standout performances from newcomers and familiar faces alike. The chemistry between Ford and his co-stars is palpable, adding depth to the relationships at the core of the film. Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character, in particular, brings a refreshing and feisty dynamic to the story.\r\n\r\nThe film's plot is a rollercoaster ride of suspense and intrigue. From the moment the adventure begins, it never lets up, taking us on a globe-trotting quest filled with ancient mysteries, treacherous traps, and high-stakes encounters. \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" skillfully weaves historical and mythological elements into the narrative, providing a satisfying blend of history and fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. The film's use of practical effects and practical stunts harks back to the franchise's roots and sets it apart from modern CGI-laden blockbusters. Each action set piece is meticulously choreographed and filled with heart-pounding moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat.\r\n\r\nJohn Williams' iconic score is the icing on the cake, evoking a sense of nostalgia while adding new layers to the film's atmosphere. The music enhances every scene, amplifying the emotional resonance of key moments.\r\n\r\n\"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" also succeeds in exploring the character's personal journey and growth. It delves into Indy's motivations, regrets, and his enduring quest for knowledge and adventure, giving the character a deeper and more relatable dimension.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" is a triumphant return to the beloved franchise. It manages to capture the essence of what makes Indiana Jones an enduring hero while introducing fresh elements to keep the series exciting and relevant. It's a must-see for fans and a thrilling adventure for newcomers, proving that the magic of Indiana Jones is as strong as ever.", "I took my daughter along to see this, naively expecting light, family friendly fun and well, its not. Not even a little.\r\n\r\nThe kindest way I can describe this monstrosity is mean spirited, misandry. The message is simply not one I want my child taking on board.\r\n\r\nMy daughter wanted to leave before I'd even suggested it, so we did and had a better time doing something else together.\r\n\r\nIn summary, in my opinion, nasty and spiteful.

It's an adult movie with childhood references (not a kids' film at all), and seems pitched at people roughly my age (Matchbox 20 referenced as a track for wooing is too close for comfort!) It _superbly_ voices the internal contradictions women need to navigate to be accepted. It works hard not to centre Ken, even while his role is a critical counterpoint, but also gives a little airtime to how much a male-dominated world makes it hard to be a man too.\r\n\r\nThe writing is out of this world, the pacing is spot on, and Margot Robbie utterly _nails_ the role \u2014 especially the emotional and physical aspects of being a doll in a way that playfully nods to the many ways that children play with Barbie.\r\n\r\nIt's a wonderful film that I'd encourage everyone to see.

Writer-director Greta Gerwig\u2019s latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that\u2019s about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What\u2019s more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like \u201cwriting\u201d than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat.

To its credit, \u201cBarbie\u201d does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I\u2019ll easily forget before year\u2019s end \u2013 and one that conclusively proves the power of marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted.", "McKinnon and Gosling's acting is great, and the dance numbers are really well done.

Needless to say, she wasn't best pleased and so now, some time after, he heads to Portugal to try to make amends (and so the crew can get some sun). Of course what he really wants is to reunite with \"Tessa\" but can he grow up enough to realise the errors of his ways and to reconcile with her? Well I really could not have cared less. Initially I found Tiffin to have a little charm about him, but now this part has been well and truly exhausted and he has neither that charm nor any charisma to bring to a role that really consists of a pretty odious and self-indulgent character. There's lots of familial discord, an on/off drink problem (probably for us watching, too) and the ending was more like a sigh of relief for all concerned. I know, I'm not the demographic - but money has been spent on this - and it's money that could have been better spent on - well, just about anything.

Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and na\u00efve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist\u2019s life, chronicles his development of \u201cthe gadget\u201d and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer\u2019s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture\u2019s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering\u2019s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.", "Cillian Murphy, so hot right now. Film is a little long though.", "The intersection of innovation, science, political bureaucracy, and ethics meet in writer-director Christopher Nolan\u2018s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a dark, challenging biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it\u2019s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.\r\n\r\nThere has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that\u2019s a far cry from what I\u2019d call \u201centertaining.\u201d It\u2019s a great movie that\u2019s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn\u2019t really worth it.\r\n\r\nNolan\u2019s film is poignant in a way that\u2019s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that\u2019s plaguing society. There\u2019s a very real moral question about humanity\u2019s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan\u2019s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.\r\n\r\nNolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer\u2019s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover\u2019s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won\u2019t be completely lost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn\u2019t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it\u2019s refreshing to see a riveting movie that\u2019s made for thinking audiences.", "The cinematic masterpiece that is Oppenheimer leaves an indelible impression on anyone who watches it. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this film, delivering a poignant message about the horrors of nuclear war. The superb direction and exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and others draw you into the story, making you feel as though you are right there in the midst of it all. Even though there aren't any action scenes, the movie still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire 3-hour runtime. Oppenheimer is a biopic that everyone knows the ending to, but thanks to the expert direction and awe-inspiring performances, it is an experience that will leave a lasting impression on you.", "excellent, a perfect example of true defined cinema\r\nAt a whopping three hours long it, very much like LOTR, feels considerably less.\r\nA must watch", "The movie is incredibly overrated and filled with unnecessary dramatized scenes, making it excessively long. It presents Oppenheimer as a cliche, portraying him as the world's smartest man who can learn a language in six weeks, accompanied by aggressively written advanced equations on a blackboard with a loud soundtrack.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this film stands as Nolan's second worst movie, following Tenet. It embodies all his negative qualities, and its duration should not have exceeded 1 hour and 40 minutes, stretching unnecessarily to 3 hours.", "This is absolutely the right step needed for Punjabi Cinema.\r\nThis is the stepping stone that hopefully changes the Punjabi cinema industry and we get many more movies on Sikh History.\r\n\r\nThe first 10-15 minutes are absolutely powerful.\r\nHowever, from there it's just comedy + romantic story + a bit of Qalandar's backstory.\r\nThe jokes are definitely very funny and got many laughs from me.\r\nThe last 30-40 minutes are the real eye catching masterpiece filled with goosebump moments.\r\n\r\nAlso, I found myself really appreciating details like the set design, costumes and dialogues.\r\nOverall, this is an absolutely commendable effort and hopefully we get MANY MORE movies about Sikh History.\r\nThis was also one of the best theatrical experience I've ever experienced.\r\n\r\nI NEED A MAHARAJA RANJIT SINGH MOVIE PLEASEEEEEEE", "There\u2019s a sweet life lesson at the heart of \u201cNo Hard Feelings,\u201d the supposed \u201craunchy comedy\u201d from co-writer and director Gene Stupnitsky. What a shame that it\u2019s buried under a heap of dreadfully unfunny attempts at humor, dumb pratfalls,and tired sex jokes that fall flat one hundred percent of the time. No bones about it: this is not just a really terrible comedy, it\u2019s an awful movie all around.\r\n\r\nBartender Maddie (Jennifer Lawrence) just watched her car get towed from the driveway, and needs wheels, fast. While browsing the want ads, she stumbles upon an intriguing job listing: wealthy helicopter parents (Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick) are searching for someone to \u201cdate\u201d their introverted 19-year-old son, Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman), before he leaves for college. The pay for sleeping with their son? A used Buick. Maddie decides to take the job but in the process, she gets far more than she bargains for.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a decent premise for a movie, but Lawrence is horribly miscast in the role. She\u2019s too old to play the part of Maddie, which makes her relationship with a teenager feel a little icky. Lawrence is also called on to do a lot of comedy work and as talented as she is, she simply lacks the knack for comedic timing (she\u2019s especially awful at physical comedy).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also a problematic message to send to young men: if you haven\u2019t slept with a woman before venturing away from home and off into adulthood, then you aren\u2019t much of a \u201cman.\u201d Just think if the roles were reversed here, and it was a 32 year old man trying to force himself on a 19 year old woman so she could get \u201cexperience\u201d before heading to college. The standard needs to be the same regardless of the sex of the main characters.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the story consists of ridiculous situations where Maddie is aggressively trying to seduce Percy, none of them funny and all of them growing old, quickly. Stupnitsky (and co-writer John Phillips) go for the lowest hanging fruit every time, and the only laughter I could muster while watching this dreck came from forced chuckles.\r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the major problem with the movie: everyone is trying so hard to turn it into a wacky, racy comedy that they miss the actual heart of the story.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between Maddie and Percy is somewhat charming, and the way they grow individually while together is actually heartwarming. All of that is overshadowed by the lame attempts to make it a raunchy, sexy, adult comedy. In struggling to be both, it succeeds at neither.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo Hard Feelings\u201d is best when it stops trying to be something it\u2019s not.", "Something Something Grooming... yeah, I didn't really get that vibe from this movie.\r\n\r\nBut it was creepy that a kids parents would basically pay someone off to... doink... their son.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately it doesn't work, Jennifer Lawrence is just a horrible person in this.  From pretty much start-to-finish she is a horrible human being, and in order for this story to work she needs to be likeable.  She needs to be relatable.  She needs to be someone that the male protagonist would actually fall for...\r\n\r\n... and instead she's the type of person that you don't want to know.  She's not even a rougish charmer.  She's not a lovable con artist.  She's just completely unappealing.  And that is why the film doesn't work.\r\n\r\nAndrew Barth Feldman comes across as legitimately socially awkward, but he also comes across as someone that doesn't want to be around her, and doesn't like her because of her completely toxic qualities.  \r\n\r\nThe script is at least aware enough to include that... but then does a 180 where he has to pretend that, after dealing with her, he actually wants to be around her... because the plot requires it.\r\n\r\nFor some reason he doesn't want to have sex with her because HE is awkward, not because she is awful. Which makes it a little unbelievable.  \r\n\r\nI suppose in their effort to show that Jennifer don't need no man, they forget that they were making her into someone no one would want to be around long enough to bang.  If they wrote her as someone that at least hesitated to ruin the fun of little kids.... they could have had a win.

It features a visually stunning inter-element love story mixed with a beautiful journey of self-discovery. The outstanding world-building is once again a highlight, as are the numerous exceptionally enlightening visual details about the interaction between the different elements. Emigration, discrimination, and family ideals are some of the many essential topics addressed.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the criticism surrounding the alleged \"fall of Pixar\" and this latest movie. I will continue to enjoy these stories, and I highly recommend that viewers try to do the same, without worrying about incessantly comparing to what came before.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "\"Elemental\" is an outstanding Pixar movie that utilizes the medium of animation to tell a compelling story. It goes beyond being just a rom-com and instead offers a powerful narrative about people, even though the characters represent elements. Pixar effectively uses various elements to convey a captivating human story that resonates with viewers. The film highlights the idea that despite our differences, we can coexist in a society that often tries to separate us. \"Elemental\" stands out as one of the most visually colourful movies with excellent music, including a memorable end credits song. While children may not fully grasp the film's deep concepts, it leaves a lasting impact on their lives, and when they revisit it as adults, they will come to understand its profound message.", "\"Mike Lane\" (Channing Tatum) is now reduced to tending bar at exclusive functions when he encounters the wealthy \"Max\" (Salma Hayek). She offers him $6k for a private dance, and this moves her world sufficiently for her to take him to London with an unique offer that shocks her estranged husband, their adopted daughter (and the narrator) \"Zadie\" (Jemelia George) and amuses her rather sceptical factotum \"Victor\" (Ayub Khan-Din). What's wrong with this film, though, is that it attempts to inflict a plot on what has been essentially, up to now, a series of (very) soft porn dance routines that allow those of us to relish some fit young blokes parading their abs and asses whilst giving us a good old dose of raunch! This offers very little of that, even at the end - and as such the thing struggles to engage. There are the odd moments that raise a smile, but Hayek overacts dreadfully and Tatum spends too much of his time standing around with his hands in his pockets as both deliver a rather strained and contrived dialogue. Simply, not enough happens on stage here and, well, let's hope it is, indeed, his last dance - this is poor, sorry.", "\u201cAir\u201d is a sports marketing drama that delivers satisfying entertainment with a feel-good, universal appeal. Never would I have guessed that a film about business deals and shoe marketing would be so engaging, but this true story about the game-changing partnership in 1984 between an NBA rookie named Michael Jordan and the athletic apparel company Nike is gratifying on all levels. You don\u2019t have to be a basketball fan or even know anything about Jordan to enjoy this film. It\u2019s a biopic all right \u2013 but of the men behind the Air Jordan sneaker line, not the superstar athlete.\r\n\r\nDirected by Ben Affleck (who also co-stars), the film explores the history of how the legendary Air Jordan sneaker line was birthed into existence, telling the story of the high-stakes business gamble that had the potential to make or break Nike.\r\n\r\nWhen scout and basketball division lead Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) sets his sights on the talented UNC rookie (who has recently been drafted by the Chicago Bulls) to be the athlete that Nike needs to boost their shoe line, he is met with resistance from his team of reluctant colleagues. They\u2019re skeptical at first, but eventually find Sonny\u2019s passion to be contagious and hop on board.\r\n\r\nMuch of the narrative is focused on the behind-the-scenes company men, discussions about money, and valid concerns about taking a huge risk on Sonny\u2019s gut feeling that this kid has the potential to become an international sports superstar. There\u2019s a lot shown about the creativity process, brainstorming sessions, and outside-the-box marketing that helped Nike sell their shoes to an up-and-coming NBA player. Although it may sound like it, this isn\u2019t a dry business story, but an enjoyable film filled with casual charm.\r\n\r\nAffleck includes a who\u2019s who of Nike in the 80s, from Peter Moore (Matthew Maher), Nike\u2019s Creative Director and the man who designed the Air Jordan sneaker (and also had the brilliant idea to put Jordan\u2019s silhouette on the product line), Howard White (Chris Tucker), who influenced the basketball player to sign with the company, Marketing Director Rob Strasser (Jason Bateman), and Nike co-founder Phil Knight (Affleck), who credits the Air Jordan as the product that saved his company.\r\n\r\nA secondary plot line involves Sonny\u2019s efforts to convince Jordan\u2019s bulldog agent David Falk (Chris Messina) and family, in particular his smart and savvy mother Deloris (Viola Davis), to sign with Nike over the more popular competing brands Converse and Adidas. Discussions between Sonny and Deloris deliver the film\u2019s most powerful scenes, especially when you see a tenacious mother who knows her son\u2019s worth and has no problem holding her own in a room full of corporate suits. It\u2019s unusual to find a film that keeps the audience invested in the story from both sides, and I found myself hoping for Sonny to land a great contract but also for Deloris to get the best deal possible for her son and family.\r\n\r\nTo reveal more about the story would constitute major spoilers, especially if you are unfamiliar with the history of the shoe, but Affleck\u2019s storytelling is so engaging that it will keep you emotionally invested even if you know the eventual outcome.\r\n\r\nAs a director, Affleck has an enviable, natural flair for telling true stories. His casual style and instincts are on full display here. The film is an example of one of those instances that are few and far between, where the subject matter is the perfect match for the director. This is a story that obviously is close to Affleck\u2019s heart, and it\u2019s reflected throughout the film.\r\n\r\n\u201cAir\u201d is a well-made movie about the American Dream from two different sides of the equation. There aren\u2019t many missteps here, and everything from the direction, lively screenplay (written by Alex Convery), and warm performances all flow together in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "Slightly forced 1980s aesthetic/nostalgia trip aside, <em>'Air'</em> is quality!\r\n\r\nThe 80s was before my time, so I guess I'm not best placed to talk about it, but the constant shots of 80s things with 80s music with extremely 80s enviroments did get a tiny bit tiresome to me. I recall people saying similar-ish with <em>'Stranger Things'</em> season 3, though I found the mix of it there to more befitting. I'm nit-picking, I know, but it just was super noticeable to me here.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of that unimportant stuff. The film is great. The whole cast do terrific work, particularly Matt Damon, Viola Davis (the phone call scene between those two is excellent), Jason Bateman and Ben Affleck. I'd say the secondary portion of the almost 2hrs is the stronger, prior to that I was intrigued but not invested... by the end I was both. It's a predictable story, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThe decision to practically not have a Michael Jordan character in a movie about Michael Jordan is an interesting one. It feels a tad awkward when he is in a scene and they intentionally 'hide' him. I get why, and it mostly works, but it does feel dorky at a point or two.\r\n\r\nOverall, very good.

The only person in the house was his wife <i>Sandra</i>, <b>Sandra H\u00fcller</b>, the prime suspect. Their son <i>Daniel</i>, blind from an unfortunate event, is the only witness. The story is from the perspective of <i>Sandra</i>, and just like any courtroom drama, details are revealed over time. Fortunately, it's at a steady pace, never announcing too much or too little, giving us the correct information at the right time. While I'm mostly positive about the story, some moments slow right down, and we come to a standstill; overall, thanks to the following few components, they considerably make up for the story's flaws. \r\n\r\nPerformance: \r\nIts lead is <i>Anatomy of a Fall's</i> greatest asset, <b>Sandra H\u00fcller</b>. She is tremendous, pulling no punches in the role of Sandra, the deceased's wife.

This is a positively dreadful film, and I\u2019m at a complete loss to understand how viewers have found it funny. When a pair of lesbian high school students (Rachel Sennott, Ayo Edebiri) establish a fight club (i.e., a euphemistically labeled \u201cself-defense program\u201d) as a means to surreptitiously bed down their cheerleader classmates (a story line that\u2019s more than a little dubious in itself), they subsequently launch into a meandering narrative that makes little sense and plays like it was made up by a group of stoners who\u2019ll laugh at anything when suitably smoked up. The film starts out trying way too hard and then proceeds to quickly go downhill from there. Much of the material is in questionable taste, too, such as sequences that feature unrestrained physical abuse against women, as well as other forms of sanctioned violence. How is this stuff supposed to be funny? \u201cBottoms\u201d has been described by viewers and critics as a go-for-broke/anything-for-a-laugh comedy, but I found its distasteful stabs at humor cringeworthy at best. What\u2019s more, the picture\u2019s feeble attempts at trying to inject the narrative with a message related to women\u2019s empowerment are completely betrayed by its many wrong-headed plot devices. To the film\u2019s credit, it does feature some passable performances by its supporting cast (most notably Punkie Johnson, Dagmara Dominczyk and former NFL star Marshawn Lynch). But, sadly, this effort is a big step down for director Emma Seligman and writer-actor Rachel Sennott, both of whom turned in brilliant work in their raucous collaboration, \u201cShiva, Baby\u201d (2020) (not to mention that Sennott\u2019s casting represents a laughable choice for someone who\u2019s nearly 28 attempting to portray an 18-year-old character). It\u2019s also quite a comedown for producer Elizabeth Banks, who scored big earlier this year with the utterly hilarious \u201cCocaine Bear.\u201d It occurred to me after watching this debacle that maybe I\u2019m just getting old and losing my sense of humor, but, after thinking it over, I realized that\u2019s genuinely not the case.

Meantime, cheating school heart-throb \"Jeff\" (Nicholas Galitzine) is having a row with his girlfriend \"Isabel\" (Havana Rose Liu) that sees the latter take refuge with the girls in their car and the most minuscule of car accidents reduce this macho lad to a gibbering wreck! This is what inspires our duo to start a club at school that will ostensibly teach young women the basics of self defence whilst allowing them to maybe get some \"fun\" into the bargain! What now ensues is all rather puerile, I found. Maybe it's supposed to be satire, but that any school would allow the pupils to use the gym to beat each other up - under the supervision of a teacher - is just preposterous. The characterisations are just about as shallow as you can get and the writers need to appreciate that using the full gamut of Anglo-Saxon expletives doesn't actually make a film funny. As it lumbers on it becomes more and more cringe-worthy until a denouement that is just like something left on the cutting room floor from an edition of \"Happy Days\". I get that I'm not the demographic, but this is still a weakly constructed, over-acted and rather aggressive reinforcement of just about every stereotype there might be in an American school - and none of these people come off very well.", "**Scream VI cranks up the violence, paranoia, and chaos but also enhances the character development and story, making the new directors' second entry even better than I had hoped!**\r\n\r\nI have been hyped and anxiously anticipating this movie since the final moments of finishing Scream (2022) in theaters - and it did not disappoint! The Radio Silence team (Bettinnelli-Olpin and Gillett) prove they are the perfect new shepherds of the franchise. The four young survivors take giant leaps in character development as they grapple with the trauma, fallout, and spotlight of the last film's events. Their loyalty and care for each other draw immediate similarities to Sidney, Dewey, and Gale, which quickly endear the \"Core Four\" as beloved characters you desperately want to survive. The danger, kills, and gore all have been cranked up a notch, and for the first time in the franchise, even the survivors are possible Ghostfaces. I doubt and suspect everyone while simultaneously caring for them - that is masterful writing right there! On top of all that, having another legacy character back with Kirby Reed returning was fantastic. I loved this movie, but I really missed Dewey and Sidney. I also think the main Ghostface killer is a little too over the top when revealed, which keeps Scream (1996) and Scream (2022) ahead on my list. But those are incredibly minor complaints!

Instead of spending the rest of the movie in a jail cell on sexual assault charges, and then getting sued into the ground, the film just goes on. (The victim was a white male, so modern hollywood wants you to think it's 'funny' rather than disgusting.) From that point on, the main character is in no way an innocent victim, so it's hard to care that she's being pursued by a killer. The plot is mediocre, there are no funny or cool characters that the viewer might actually care about, and the killer's identity has reached the level of 'roommate's friend's brother's dogwalker', aka 'who cares'.

What he doesn't appreciate, though, is that in the intervening years things got tough for his erstwhile friends. They couldn't fend for themselves, and were reduced to cannibalism to survive.... Aside from altering the balance of their tiny mids, this also instilled in \"Pooh\" and \"Piglet\" a grim and determined need for vengeance. What now ensues is hilarious. What ever budget there was must have been spent on gin for the cast: the costumes and lighting are pretty dreadful and the script - well that is almost as bad as the acting. Leon is quite easy on the eye, but the sight of him being whipped to within an inch of his life with the tail of \"Eyeore\" by a large man in an ill-fitting yellow bear suit whose mouth was oozing honey like a drooling bairn just has to be seen. Cinema can be too earnest and worthy at times, and I think this is the perfect recalibration for that - it is certainly neither, nor is it a film you will ever (want to) remember after you've seen it. Still, the cinema was packed and there was laughter a-plenty throughout the eighty minutes or so this risible drivel lasted. It could easily be a school project - nothing here is of an higher standard, and it did make me squirm at times as the 1970s \"Doctor Who\" special effects department came back to life - but I didn't hate it.", "Rhys Frake-Waterfield... what in god's name have you done.\r\n\r\nLet me preface this with a note that I am no stranger to horror, terrible horror, and finding enjoyment in what the masses hated.\r\n\r\nI went into this knowing this was a godawful movie. I expected at least one of those \"i know this b rated horror is ridiculous, terrible and pure shite, but because I know that, it will be hilarious.\"\r\n\r\noh boy. and there's a sequel?\r\n\r\nroll on another godawful series i now have to complete bc thats the way my brain and ocd works.\r\n\r\nthis is godawful. i mean _god awful_. i mean i couldnt stop yawning, i almost stopped watching entirely and dropped it, and i have promptly told everyone who was going to watch it under the same premises of \"this is awful so it should be funny\" to just stay cleer of it and watch any of the other 100-300 horror movies coming out this year.\r\n\r\nthat being said, if this was an animated horror movie, i think this would have been perfect and done brilliantly. but this? dear lord.\r\n\r\nwhat a terrible start to my 2023 year watching.", "The first question I asked myself after leaving the theater after screening \u201cBook Club: The Next Chapter\u201d was \u201cwait a minute, did this movie even have a script?\u201d The story is so paper-thin that it seems like a long improv session between four of the most charming actresses over 70. The sad (or great?) thing about this is that it doesn\u2019t really matter, because co-writer and director Bill Holderman unapologetically made this movie for a target audience that will gobble it up and leave wanting more.\r\n\r\nAll facing different milestones in their lives, four best friends Diane (Diane Keaton), Vivian (Jane Fonda), Sharon (Candice Bergen), and Carol (Mary Steenburgen) decide to take their book club to Italy for the fun girls trip they never had. With the news that one of their own has recently gotten engaged, the gals use it as an excuse to have a whirlwind bachelorette party. The relaxing vacation turns into a cross country journey that takes them from Rome to Tuscany and beyond on an adventure of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much substance to this senior citizen fluff, and just because it\u2019s watchable does not mean it\u2019s entertaining. There are a lot of vapid scenes that do nothing to further the narrative, and the film has close to zero story or plot. Astute viewers (to be honest, even those who have only seen a handful of Hallmark movies) will figure out the big surprise long before its overlong reveal, leaving most of the audience bored, trying to savor the lovely scenery of the Italian countryside.\r\n\r\nThe cast is terrific, but I wouldn\u2019t call what they\u2019re doing \u201cacting.\u201d It\u2019s more like a camera has been turned on a group of old friends having fun together. They\u2019re drinking wine and eating mountains of pasta, spinning yarns and puttering around Italy. Co-screenwriters Holderman and Erin Simms pander to their demographic with plenty of old lady one-liners and slightly raunchy wordplay that\u2019ll make grandma blush.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so nice to see older actors getting work, and Craig T. Nelson, Don Johnson, Andy Garcia are well cast and provide a little testosterone to the story (although all of the men are portrayed as hopelessly romantic, and their grand gestures are laughable). This one is all about the ladies, though, and each one is irresistible in their own way. Their chemistry is believable and authentic, which makes these characters part of group to which we\u2019d all love to belong. If not for the charisma of the cast, this film would sink even harder and faster.\r\n\r\n\u201cBook Club: The Next Chapter\u201d is not a good movie. It\u2019s dumb, predictable, and lacks sophistication. Despite it all, the film reaches its ultimate goal of being a sweetly enchanting fairy tale for moms and grandmas everywhere.", "Talking about the subject of Near Death Experiences (NDEs) was once about as taboo as speaking about UFOs or seeing a psychiatrist \u2013 sure signs that someone was probably psychologically unstable, even if he or she merely believed in these things, let alone having had experiences with them. Thankfully, however, those days are largely behind us now, and speaking about them openly and honestly has become much more rational and commonplace. Such is the case in this new offering from directors Stephen Gray and Chris Radtke, who provide a comprehensive look at a subject that was once considered suspect \u2013 even laughable \u2013 but is now taken quite seriously, including by those who were once among its greatest detractors. The film presents a detailed look at the phenomenon, featuring interviews with such researchers as Raymond Moody, often credited as being primarily responsible for bringing NDEs into the mainstream dialogue, and experiencers of these events. It also presents a series of NDE re-enactments, including depictions of what led up to them and what happened as the experiences unfolded, all backed by stunningly gorgeous CGI effects of an admittedly indescribable reality and a beautifully emotive original score. This combination of elements thus provides an excellent overview of what make up NDEs while simultaneously conveying the obviously heartfelt emotions associated with them, bringing the experiences home to viewers in a way that other documentaries on the subject haven\u2019t previously been able to accomplish. It sheds profound light on what can happen when one goes through these existential gateways and how returnees are often fundamentally changed by the experiences, giving them new outlooks on life and their purpose in it. While it\u2019s true that this offering doesn\u2019t present much that\u2019s especially new about NDEs and that its pacing can be a little slow (and redundant) at times, it nevertheless does a superb job of immersing audiences in the material, again, a big improvement over previous attempts at addressing this subject. And pay no heed to the cynics who have erroneously called this little more than religious propaganda; while it\u2019s true there are a handful of Christian-oriented references scattered throughout the film, the overall take here is more spiritual in nature, an ecumenical approach at examining the afterlife than one that\u2019s exclusively rooted in any particular theological tradition. Viewers who may have been skeptical, unfamiliar with or skittish about this subject may find themselves surprisingly enlightened by what this release has to say. And the fact that it\u2019s playing widely in mainstream theaters to astonishingly well-attended audiences also speaks volumes about the appeal and apparent universality of this title. As this film so astutely shows, death isn\u2019t the end \u2013 and it\u2019s high time we stopped looking at it that way.", "The one thing a good whodunnit should not do is put its audience to sleep. Unfortunately, this latest cinematic adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel fails miserably on this score. Director Kenneth Branagh\u2019s third outing as Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot is a protracted snooze that leaves viewers caring little about the characters and even less about the story in which they\u2019re trapped. When the famed detective (Branagh) \u2013 now in retirement in Venice \u2013 is called upon by a friend and author of murder mysteries (Tina Fey) to help her verify or discredit the psychic powers of a medium (Michelle Yeoh) at a s\u00e9ance at an allegedly haunted Venetian palazzo, he\u2019s drawn into yet another of his famous investigations. The problem here is that what should be an engaging story is interminably dull, one that, regrettably, prompts frequent checking of one\u2019s watch. Moreover, virtually the entire film is shot with excessively dark camera work (so much for showing off the glories of Venice). And then there are the performances, which feature good turns by Yeoh and Jude Hill but a positively wooden portrayal by Branagh (compared to his previous depictions of the protagonist) and an absolutely dreadful performance by a woefully miscast Fey. To its credit, like its recent predecessors, the production values of this Christie offering are top shelf, but that\u2019s about all this release has going for it, a far cry from the much better overall work found in \u201cMurder on the Orient Express\u201d (2017) and \u201cDeath on the Nile\u201d (2023). Indeed, even fans of the famed mystery writer are likely to find \u201cA Haunting in Venice\u201d tiresome and tedious. Pack a lunch for this one.", "With heavy influences from Studio Ghibli\u2019s _Spirited Away_ and _Howl\u2019s Moving Castle_, _Deep Sea_ is the best animated film of the year that most won\u2019t see or even know about.

And it took less than a year.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it has a plot, a Kraken trying to pass as human turns into a Kraken and meh-essaging.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, it's another cartoon that cares more about pushing a political message than it does entertaining the audience.\r\n\r\nAnd it's made for children... do you really want to bring little boys to a movie who's primary narrative is that white males are evil and irredeemably so?  That sort of message isn't exactly child friendly, unless you are raising your child to hate.", "The numerous manuals on my shelves for 1st to 5e speak volumes of my familiarity with the game, as does the novels I own, and the numerous D&D computer games I've played, so I was ecstatic seeing the places, people, and creatures I know very well. I've heard others who have played the game say they wished they had done a movie about characters like Elminster, Drizzt Do'Urden, or Alias instead. While they would have been nice to see, those characters are from the lore not the game. What I was more hoping for was that the characters in this movie felt like the characters the players play, the adventures they go on, and the antics they get themselves into. This movie felt like that in spades, and it was an absolute joy to see. I watched this and was constantly reminded of the crazy things I did as a player or watched others do as their DM, and more importantly the fun we had playing the game we all loved. This is why I give it my highest recommendation to all others who have played the game, and especially to those who have not so they may see for themselves what Dungeons & Dragons is really about. 8/10", "Based on the legendary role-playing game, \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d is nothing like what I anticipated and much better than I expected. This irresistible fantasy adventure has a healthy dose of good humor, playful charm, and is easily accessible to all who love imaginary worlds filled with wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, knights, and fire-breathing dragons.\r\n\r\nCharismatic thief Edgin (Chris Pine) and his band of unlikely adventurers (including Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) the barbarian) undertake an epic heist to retrieve a lost relic and to liberate his daughter (Chloe Coleman) from Forge\u2019s (Hugh Grant) castle. Things go dangerously awry when they run afoul of the wrong people, but the group must work together to overcome seemingly never-ending obstacles as they continue their important quest.\r\n\r\nWhile directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein stay true to the origins of the game, prior knowledge of Dungeons & Dragons isn\u2019t necessary. The film explains everything you need to know, making this an action adventure that\u2019s appropriate for everyone. It\u2019s surprising just how accessible this movie is. You don\u2019t have to know the rules of the game to get a real kick out of this one. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of Easter eggs hidden around for the gamers, but it\u2019s not so insider that the uninitiated can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. This is definitely one of the film\u2019s greatest strengths.\r\n\r\nThe story (with a script by Goldstein, Daley, and Michael Gilio) is solid too, with well-developed characters and irreverent humor that keeps the movie from becoming just another based-on-a-game throwaway. There\u2019s a ton of heart and genuine emotion, which is elevated by the terrific cast. The actors play off each other well, giving a human element to what thankfully is not just a bunch of dumb CGI. You can feel the real connection between Edgin and Holga, best friends who always have each other\u2019s backs, and Rodriguez and Pine\u2019s chemistry finds the perfect groove. Grant, who is having a career resurgence lately, is as delightful as ever as the rogue Forge Fitzwilliam, as is Justice Smith as amateur sorcerer Simon and Sophia Lillis as shape shifting tiefling druid Doric. Most shocking is that Pine isn\u2019t doing yet another version of his annoying shtick here, which in itself is a massive achievement.\r\n\r\nThe pacing is brisk and the special effects are well done, even if the finale is stretched a little thin. I found it easy to become engrossed in the mythical world of D&D not only because the movie looks great visually, but the characters are appealing, too. There\u2019s plenty to root for.\r\n\r\nEven if you think you aren\u2019t a fan of the fantasy genre, I suggest you give \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d a try. This playful, character-driven adventure offers a ton of magical fun at the movies.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / www.ScreenZealots.com**", "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that strikes a perfect balance between high fantasy and comedy.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay for the movie was pretty average in terms of the overall plot, but the individual story beats and set pieces really carried the movie forward. What makes the screenplay stand out is the creativity behind each character, giving them interesting scenes and moments to shine. The dialogue was sharp and witty, filled with great laughs throughout. However, some of the comedy was very generic, with jokes and physical comedy that have been done a dozen times over.\r\n\r\nThe performances in the film were very solid, with Chris Pine stealing the show as the lead. Pine was extremely witty and charismatic, with excellent comedic timing. Michelle Rodriguez, while playing a pretty flat character, had incredible action scenes. Rege-Jean Page was a standout in every scene he was in, with over-the-top and hilarious moments that left me in stitches. Justice Smith, who hasn't been one of my favorite actors, did well here as a great comedic character. Sophia Lillis, while not getting a ton of time to shine in terms of her acting chops, was amazing in her action set pieces, especially in the long sequence where her character shape shifts while escaping from the castle.\r\n\r\nThe direction of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves was surprisingly stellar. The action was sharp and well-choreographed, with minimal cuts allowing the audience to really get a larger grasp of what was happening. The film balanced comedy and high fantasy elements really well. While the shots weren't overly creative, the movie looked fantastic with beautiful landscapes and above-average CGI.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that exceeded my expectations. With a creative screenplay, solid performances, and fantastic direction, it deserves to be seen on the big screen.\r\n\r\nScore: 82%\r\nVerdict: Great", "A B grade action flick masquerading as a A list title. That's my reaction to Expendables 4.\r\n\r\nYes, its a tired formula but at least previous Expendable films in this cheesy action franchise, showed a little genuine enthusiasm and included a  cast of well worn but also well known, action stars. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, the latest flick is easily forgettable with a good number of cast members, I've never heard of or seen on screen, infrequently. \r\n\r\nIn summary, looks and behaves like a decidedly B grade action film with a sparse sprinkling of A grade action talent. Feels too, likes its going through the motions but not really delivering, if that makes sense.", "I love all 3 parts before this 3rd class movie. The story is classic not bad not good for this type of movies and lots of actors from the previous movies are missing, but they bring us Megan Fox and ruin everything. I hope that this will last movie in this series.", "I've watched a couple of former cinematic takes on Stephen Kings Boogeyman novel and this is by far, the least inspiring.\r\n\r\nThe real issue lies, in what can best be described, as the treatment of the tale of the cruel, child stalking creature, that potentially lives in every  closet.\r\n\r\nIts tone is obsessively analysing, of the dysfunctional family dynamic, to the point of neurosis. Yes, grieving families don't work too well, unsurprisingly. The less than optimistic over statement of this fact, overtakes the actual horror story. This, in turn, renders this film, too dark and too depressing, for its own good.\r\n\r\nThe results a predictable, not terribly enjoyable watch, that left this reviewer feeling a little washed out and disappointed. \r\n\r\nIn summary, the too dark and maudlin treatment, robs this film of the glimmer of hope, that lies at the heart of any half decent, horror film.", "Movie is really good, but there is one obvious flaw and one important condition:\r\n\r\nFlaw: you'll have to endure every scene about Jann's relationships.

I'm sure creators could invest time to more interesting and important topics.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, this flaw disappears in the shadow of other, actually important stuff. Racing.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, let's return to the condition: you have to love it when cars go BRRRRR. The main reason behind this movie is to sell you GT7 for your PS5, and believe me, after leaving the cinema, you'll at least check if there are any discounts for the game right now (yes, there are). Sound, shooting angles, tension during races \u2014 everything works perfectly and beyond! Just when you become bored, you'll be in for a surprise. When you want a new angle, you'll get it. When you forget who the sponsor of the movie is, you'll see graphics from the video game.\r\n\r\nSo, just believe me, if you love races, you have to go to the movie right now. Just select cinema with quality sound, please :)\r\n\r\nAnd as a bonus, you'll get David Harbour, who's stealing absolutely every scene.

Being completely unaware of the inspirational true story on which the movie is based made it even more fascinating, engaging, and wildly exhilarating. Lorne Balfe and Andrew Kawczynski's score contains countless tracks loaded with extremely high levels of adrenaline that transform all racing sequences into moments of pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nExceptional performance by David Harbour, who commits himself to his role in such a way that, if the awards season started now and there was no clear dependence on marketing campaigns, the actor would be one of the frontrunners.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend not researching anything about the real story *before* the film, even if just to avoid dealing with the predictable, formulaic structure of this type of movie.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "**Wrong in so many levels.**\r\nBig fan of the game since PS1 till that day. Trailer gave me no thrills so i was expecting nothing but no! Way worse than trailer. \r\nGuys ! Even GT (is a half-sim) has some reality way more than this. For starters Whats with the Hungaroring? Silverstone Academy is reverse Hungaroring, Le Mans (La Sarthe) is regular Hungaroring.... \r\nIn racing there is no wiggly helmets; cars don't explodes, engines do, there are no spotters except ovals!; track races have qualies, you don't start in the middle of nowhere; you dont pass your opponent with down shifts and sudden throttle; GT3 cars are fast as any car on straights; Le Mans 24H doesn't finish at the last lap; it finishes at the end of 24 hours + 1 lap; Nurburgring is 20.83 km and if you crash in the middle of it nobody waves yellow flags in start-finish straight. I could have add more but i am already bored. \r\nGood soundtrack, good cinematography, well blended CGI but no soul and no technical aspect. I don't even know how Yamauchi San gave his blessing to this as himself a real deal racing driver. Lastly this film is the second DRIVEN disaster IMO.(4/10)", "FNAF was great, Kinda wish it had blood, Every kill was offscreen or really dark and you cant really see the kill.", "Didn't Josh Hutcherson used to be famous? Well here he is reduced to the role of the struggling brother of \"Abby\" (Piper Rubio). Their aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson) is determined that this hapless bag of bones isn't fit to look after the young girl - after he takes out a visiting father in the fountain of a shopping mall and gets fired; so \"Mike\" has to get another job! Opportunities are thin on the ground, but there is a vacancy doing the security night shift and an old, derelict, pizza parlour. How hard can it be? Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer \"Vanessa\" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take \"Abby\" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of \"Mike\" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.", "Director Guy Ritchie is no stranger to crafting exciting action films, but his latest project is quite different than his previous work. The narrative is linear, there aren\u2019t any montages, and the story isn\u2019t about criminals, gangsters, or Brits. Fans of Ritchie will absolutely still recognize his visual style (hello, overhead shots) and testosterone-fueled themes, but \u201cThe Covenant\u201d is a more dramatic, mature, and restrained work from the legendary director.\r\n\r\nSet during the war in Afghanistan in 2018, the film tells the story of U.S. Army sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his local Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim). Called a traitor by his people for helping the Americans, Ahmed has volunteered to seek revenge against the Taliban that killed his son. He has also been promised visas for his service so his family can flee to safety in America. After a lethal ambush in the desert, Kinley is gravely injured by enemy fire. With his platoon gone, Ahmed refuses to leave a fellow soldier behind to die, so he drags Kinley through the mountainous terrain in order to get him back to the base for medical help.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of their 100 mile journey, but then pivots to Kinley\u2019s return to the United States. It\u2019s months after he gets home that Kinley learns Ahmed and his family were not given safe passage as promised and, as a way to repay the debt he owes his friend, he returns to Afghanistan to retrieve them. It won\u2019t be easy, because Ahmed has been placed at the top of the Taliban\u2019s most wanted hit list.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a meaningful story of honor and brotherhood wrapped up in an intense wartime thriller. The story is told in three major acts, from the early days Ahmed and Kinley spent chasing IEDs, to their dangerous journey, to the red tape of getting a man what he\u2019s owed. There are plenty of thrilling acting sequences throughout, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat.\r\n\r\nRitchie has an extraordinary sense of timing and instincts for shooting action scenes, and the brutal, graphic wartime violence puts you in the be-or-be-killed survival mind of a front line solider. The director\u2019s visual storytelling is terrific here, as he switches between handheld shots with uneven movements to dizzying aerial shots to sweeping tracking shots seamlessly within one action scene. It creates a greater sense of immediacy and danger, expressing the gravity of the situation at hand.\r\n\r\nSome of the scenes are so distressing that I found my heart pounding throughout, and Ritchie\u2019s use of harsh close-ups adds to the intensity. There\u2019s a lot of cat-and-mouse content that adds to the tension, but it doesn\u2019t feel gimmicky because this is a film that is unafraid to kill off characters at any time (so don\u2019t get too attached to anyone).\r\n\r\nGyllenhaal and Salim make a dynamic onscreen duo, and both men have a natural chemistry that is the highlight of the film. Salim\u2019s performance is dynamic and genuine, and Gyllenhaal proves yet again that he\u2019s a formidable leading man. He\u2019s in his natural habitat here, playing a rugged everyman with a non-threatening masculinity that gives him a broad, universal appeal. The performances from the supporting cast are also top-notch.\r\n\r\nThe story is one of integrity, loyalty, and respect, and these men have an incredible amount of honor. Ahmed and Kinley are forced to make tough decisions, but they never shy away from doing the right thing, even when it\u2019s the harder option. These guys are still combat killers and trained soldiers, but their friendship takes center stage. This is such a great story of brotherhood that you\u2019ll wish it was true (sorry folks, this is a work of fiction).\r\n\r\nThe film only makes a couple of missteps, and there are two major things that bothered me. First, the alpha male dialogue among the soldiers is openly homophobic. It\u2019s laughed off and never challenged. I found this to be a bit problematic, but the way these guys talk is also likely accurate and authentic. Second, the grand finale shootout feels a bit like military propaganda, where the brawny American saviors must step in and become the heroes. It\u2019s a sequence that\u2019s thrilling, but feels stuffed in as a way to appease the hyper-patriotic \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201d crowd.\r\n\r\nBut here\u2019s where it gets interesting: the film is also highly critical of the U.S. government and the heads of the military. The soldiers may have honor, but those at a higher level do not. The film offers a scathing criticism that applies to the many ways the U.S. abandons its veterans too, from dismissing allegations of sexual assault, making it difficult to obtain proper healthcare, crafting vague promises, and flat-out lying. It\u2019s a profound theme that may be lost on the majority of audiences (but I hope not).\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Covenant\u201d is an extremely well made wartime action film, and those looking for a thrill will find it. Go and enjoy the entertainment value, but don\u2019t lose sight of the small, emotional story that\u2019s at the heart of it all.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / www.ScreenZealots.com**", "After Guy Ritchie\u2019s last film, Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, was an absolute disaster, I seriously considered skipping his most recent outing, The Covenant. However, I'm very happy I didn't because it's become one of my favorite films of the year so far.\r\n\r\nThe direction is excellent, with amazing up-close shots and zooms that really add to the intense nature of the film. The first hour flew by with fantastic build-up and character development. The action was superb and brutally realistic, showcasing the true horrors of the War in Afghanistan in a respectable way. However, after this first act, the movie does slow down a bit, with a pretty substantial lull that lasted about 20 minutes in the middle of the film. It was not terrible, but something I definitely noticed. Performances were excellent, particularly from Dar Salim, who was a standout in the film. His grueling journey across the Afghanistan terrain was one of the most stressful and inspiring segments in any film so far this year and had me at the edge of my seat.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Covenant is a pretty straightforward war story, told with excellent direction, performances, and visuals. It handles the source material with incredible care, showcasing the environment of Afghanistan in a way I have never seen before.\r\n\r\nScore: 85% \u2705\r\nVerdict: Great", "_Transformers: Rise of the Beasts_ is a pointless entry in the live-action _Transformers_ film franchise.

You'll hate yourself for watching it.", "Writing a review for a sequel like \u201cFast X\u201d feels pretty pointless. It\u2019s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I\u2019m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect \u201cFast X\u201d to be a film that\u2019s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It\u2019s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.\r\n\r\nThe plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, \u201cFast Five.\u201d If you don\u2019t remember the movie, don\u2019t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He\u2019s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his \u201cfamily\u201d are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.\r\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cfaith.\u201d The jokes aren\u2019t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier\u2018s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman\u2019s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in \u201cF9\u201d seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie \u2014 but there\u2019s also plenty to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there\u2019s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.\r\n\r\nThe film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom\u2019s son don\u2019t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).\r\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019m a fan of all things \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. \u201cFast X\u201d feels like it\u2019s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you\u2019re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it\u2019s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.", "I've more or less enjoyed the Fast and the Furious franchise though with each installment, the writers attempt to go further in its goofiness from the previous movie, it's becoming harder and harder to really be entertained, not to mention care one iota about these characters. I will say Jason Momoa, in whatever he was doing, was a hoot in the cold-blooded villain. And in typical \"Fast\" fashion, there are scenes that don't make a lick of sense. I found some of the action scenes to be well directed I guess by journeyman Louis Leterrier who took over from Justin Lin who left only a week into production.\r\n\r\nGiven I wasn't that big of a fan of Fate of the Furious or F9, I think I've grown out of this franchise and would be a good thing to bring it to a close. **2.5/5**", "<b>INT. GANGSTERS IN OKLAHOMA - DAY</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nFilm students, film lovers, cinema-goers, and reviewers rejoice! <i>Martin Scorsese's</i> latest film is excellent! <i>The Irishman</i> might have been his last 'gangster' film. Still, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> might not be a gangster film, but there are many 'mob' elements within it.\r\n\r\nThe biggest fear people had going into this film was the runtime. Weeks before the release, speculations came out about the length of this film. I saw an article stating it would be 4 hours long! Alas, it's only 206 minutes long, not even coming close to the longest film here at Cannes. I can confirm that the film never drags its feet for too long; there are times when it slows down, but this is only during the film's opening hour. Thankfully it quickly picks up the pace and goes by fast once the whole ensemble is introduced. <i>Jesse Plemons</i> is a late bloomer in the film, only being introduced 2 hours in; as I said, this is where the film starts moving.\r\n\r\nThe story is simple: During the 1920s, oil was discovered on Osage Nation Land. Turning them into the richest people per capita in the world! <b>Ernest Burkhart</b> (<i>Leonardo DiCaprio</i>) returns to work for his uncle, <b>William Hale</b> (<i>Robert De Niro</i>). Ernest meets <b>Mollie</b> (<i>Lily Gladstone</i>), and they marry. However, slowly many of Mollie's friends and family are murdered, with those who married into the family taking ownership of the land\u2014eventually, the FBI steps in to investigate.\r\n\r\nLily and Leo have excellent on-screen chemistry, with Lily performing phenomenally. I hear talks about the Oscars for her, which is entirely valid. De Niro steals many of the scenes he's in, often providing the most laughs. He is ultimately the most 'mob-like character within the film, never pulling the trigger but commanding the troops. Jesse Plemons is the final major character within the story as <b>Tom White</b>. Unfortunately, Plemon's isn't that interesting; I wonder if Plemons wasn't given much direction or if he decided to make the character this way. Still, White moves from scene to scene without much interest. He's just there, leading the FBI but never being an individual; I didn't remember his name after the film; I just referred to him as 'FBI guy.'\r\n\r\nTechnically, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is a marvel (Not that Scorsese would like me saying the word 'Marvel'), but just like all of his films, everything is great. Nothing stands out as 'excellent'; the score, editing and cinematography are at the level you'd expect from the mind of Scorsese.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to my final thoughts on the film; recently, Martin has been talking about his age and his ability to make films like he used to. Scorsese is 80 years old and doesn't believe he has the same drive as <i>Ridley Scott</i>. Suppose this is to be his final film. In that case, I'd be happy knowing it's not a significant departure from what made him the famed director but a story worth telling from a creator who will continue to be studied and praised for the next many decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FADE OUT.</b>", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review-a-work-of-art/\r\n\r\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon is a remarkable cinematic feat by the master Martin Scorsese, with exceptional contributions from Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, as well as a striking, breakthrough performance by Lily Gladstone.\r\n\r\nIt unveils a harrowing narrative that prompts deep, poignant reflection on the past and present. Technically, all departments shine, but Thelma Schoonmaker\u2019s editing is simply flawless.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast\u2019s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn\u2019t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn\u2019t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. This movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest!

To add to the poor man's woes, when he tries to contact his wife he discovers that she is off meeting a lawyer! Can he salvage anything from this perilous, meticulously planned, scenario before they are all chum? For a while, here, Nimr\u00f3d Antal sustains a degree of menace as the mystery unfolds, but sadly - once it does, it's pretty obvious whom the protagonist actually is and the proceeding car chases make the art of simple urban road-blocking by the German police look just a little amateurish! The last twenty minutes are especially disappointing with a denouement that's not short on pyrotechnics but is short on just about everything else. It's a very derivative television movie that if you enjoy the genre, you probably won't hate - the pace sees to that. You won't remember it for long afterwards, though.", "As someone who was a victim of child sexual abuse myself and as someone who admittedly likes Trump (who praised this movie to no end) and also as a tiny bit of conspiracy nut and seeing all the mainstream media attack this movie and trying to smear it, I really, REALLY wanted to like and support and even praise this movie - but I just can't.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that it's a bit difficult for me to agree with the mainstream media's warning about this movie, but they really are correct for once - sometimes they throw you curve balls like that. I mean after all, there was a time when I trusted the mainstream media and I lost trust in them not because they were mainstream, but because they just started to get a lot of things wrong. But that also means that if they get things right for once, I can't just categorically disagree with them.\r\n\r\nAnd it's really not like they are just smearing this movie for no good reason. They do (for the most part) have a valid point. This movie does nothing to actually stop this crime or to help the victims or to help people recognize this crime when they see it. On the contrary, because it claims to be based on true events, it causes people to have a completely wrong impression about this and therefore makes it harder for people to detect it when it's happening, because this movie is less accurate in its depiction of the real world than a Liam Neeson action thriller. Actually, Liam Neeson's recent film \"Memory\" was pretty good and actually much more accurate in it's depiction of child trafficking than this movie.\r\n\r\nBecause this movie really does nothing but reinforce outdated and completely wrong stereotypes. This type of thing isn't something that mainly happens in South America or in \"other\" countries and children don't just get kidnapped out of the blue by complete strangers and against their will. The sad truth is that most cases don't involve a stranger at all, but someone the child trusts and the child isn't gonna come running to you begging for help, cause the truth is they are victims of years of extremely systematic and sophisticated psychological manipulation.\r\n\r\nAnd the perpetrators aren't all tough guys either. Actually a lot of them are quite educated, sophisticated and female because they don't raise suspicion. And also it's not just about forcing the kids to make movies - that only plays a very, very small part, but this movie would have you believe that that's the main part - that's the smallest part by far! Most of the aspects involved are MUCH worse than \"just\" that. \r\n\r\nAnd as much as I would love to think that there are plenty of officers (official or rogue) of government security agencies who are incorruptible and ceaselessly fight the \"bad guys\" in relentless sting operations, the reality sadly isn't as clear cut. Yes, sometimes SOME children do get rescued, but actually very rarely by police, much less government security agencies. Well, there was that ONE case in Bosnia where a policewoman and member of an international agency uncovered a human trafficking operation - but then again the people running it were her colleagues...", "**_Operation Fortune's_ convoluted plot and terrible pacing result in a viewing experience that leaves a lot to be desired.**\r\n\r\nOperation Fortune was a terrible movie from start to finish. The plot was incredibly generic, filled with a bunch of cool spy jargon that made the agents sound really cool. The pace is way too fast, with jump cuts from scene to scene that attempt to be quick and seamless but just left me lost. I spent more time trying to figure out what was going on, where we were, and why we were here than I did enjoying the actual movie. The action was average at best, filled with cuts that tried to mask the poor choreography. When we were not spending time on lackluster action set pieces, it was used to deliver exposition dumps to help the audience attempt to understand what was going on. I have a hard time coming up with anything positive about my experience with the film.\r\n\r\nThe performances left a lot to be desired. I think Jason Statham and Josh Hartnett did a decent job, but they did not blow me away. None of the main cast had any amount of chemistry, particularly Statham and Plaza. The latter quite disappointed me in this film. None of her comedic timing worked, and I found her performance to be rather flat. With how stacked the cast was, I am leaning toward believing that the script was so horrid that it was limiting the actors abilities to put on a good performance.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a pretty terrible time watching this in theaters. I kept checking the time, waiting for the credits to finally roll.

I almost felt like an hour of screen time was cut from the film because many characters and plot points seemed incomplete. The entire movie was disjointed. The action was mediocre. The writing was so bad. There were so many great qualities this movie had going for it.

Co-directed by Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears and co-written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg, this animated feature is confident, action packed, funny, and is a visual delight. It\u2019s a crowning achievement in animation, and the perfect summer movie to boot.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the origin story of four turtle brothers, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), who were mutated after a dangerous laboratory explosion left them covered in radioactive ooze. Their adopted father Splinter (Jackie Chan), a kind and elderly New York City sewer rat, has sheltered his teenage sons from the harsh, dangerous, and judgmental human world for over a decade. Deciding that they want to be accepted as normal teenagers, the brothers head out into the city on their own, crossing paths with young reporter April O\u2019Neil (Ayo Edebiri). A fast friendship develops, and the turtles find themselves taking on a mysterious crime syndicate that\u2019s run by fellow mutants.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a good story that\u2019s elevated by across-the-board talent. Spears and Rowe\u2019s crackerjack direction is on point, especially when it comes to orchestrating thrilling action scenes. This is easily one of the most well-directed animated features I\u2019ve ever seen. Energetic and bursting with enthusiasm, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to have a blast watching this movie.\r\n\r\nThe characters are great, too. The turtles may be mutants, but they still act like regular, dumb teenage boys, finding humor in the silliness of everyday experiences. The voice performances are outstanding too, with a talented cast and a diversity that feels natural and appropriate. Everyone (including Paul Rudd, Ice Cube, John Cena, Rose Byrne, and Giancarlo Esposito) gives top-tier turns, and it makes the movie even better.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this animated film isn\u2019t made for little kids, and youngsters will likely be very bored and fidgety. This is more of a movie that\u2019s geared towards \u2018tweens, teens, and their parents (especially dads over 35 who grew up with the Ninja Turtles in various iterations). I would think longtime fans would be enamored with what the film does to their classic heroes, because a person like me who had very limited knowledge of the characters was quickly won over.\r\n\r\nFilms like \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d are exciting because not only are they breathing exciting life into the animation genre, they are setting the highest standards for quality, edgy animated films for adults.

This might have been a bit better if they'd just cut all the preamble and gone straight to the rig and to the underwater action, big fish and pyrotechnics. As it is, we spend far too long meandering about on the surface meeting the characters and there's way too much pointless dialogue throughout - though one or two half-hearted witticisms and puns help a little - before an ending that is entirely predictable and really rather processionally so. The acting is just banal, the continuity is all over the place - as is the editing - and the huge chunk of Ali Baba money that's floated this thing ensures that the switches from the English to Chinese languages actually smacks more of keeping everybody happy in the boardroom rather than engaging anyone in the actual cinema. Simply, even the charismatic Statham cannot rescue this from the doldrums of CGI-led mediocrity that churns out an unremarkable hybrid of \"Jaws\" and \"Jurassic Park\". It does need a big screen. If you wait til it's on the telly then you will be even more disappointed. Mind you, is that actually possible?", "Meg 2 doesn't really feel like a follow up film, to its 2018 counterpart. Indeed, the latest instalment feels more like a platform for various action \"stunts\". \r\n\r\nThe giant,prehistoric shark's are essentially window dressing, for a variety of frenetic action sequences, where things blow up, are torn apart, shot at, harpooned, people gobbled up Jaws and Jurassic Park style and what I can only describe as acrobatic, aquatic scenes with jet ski's and the like, all take place. They even throw in a giant squid, to spice things up. \r\n\r\nOr put more simply, this is a messy mash up, of derivative, often dispirit ideas. Unsurprisingly, the results a bit chaotic, with no compass to direct the viewer, in terms of the story, such as it is. Its quite watchable, in its own way but it never really goes anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn summary, watchable on a very visually superficial level. Lots of action but little in the way of an established story, to pull the whole thing together.", "Pretty tough sitting through this one, especially the first half where a good portion was so dark, maybe to hide the bad visual effects, I couldn't even tell what was going on. There were a few moments of the camp that made the first one at least entertaining, but not enough to keep me engaged. On the plus side, Jason Statham was alright for what he's given, otherwise this just was a waste of time. **2.0/5**", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-is-an-animated-work-of-art/\r\n\r\n\"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the epitome of incredibly detailed, gorgeously unique, undeniably epic animation within its medium. Separately from enjoying this movie or not, any or all cinephiles should bow to the ridiculously talented artists and animators behind this pure work of art.\r\n\r\nThat said, the attributes and issues are more or less the same as the original. The various animation styles are overwhelmingly stunning, but also to the point of creating confusing moments. Gwen Stacy stands out from the rest of the pack \u2013 both the character and Hailee Steinfeld's voice performance \u2013 but everyone on screen is impressively captivating. The voice cast is superb all-around.\r\n\r\nAn unfinished story \u2013 remember, this is the first of two parts \u2013 about what it really means to be a hero. The 140-minute runtime isn't exactly heavy, but the necessity to resort to exposition scenes is more frequent than in the previous flick, even though the narrative complexity ends up justifying this.\r\n\r\nA must-see movie in the cinema! Go support animation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "I don't know, but in my humble opinion, the punk Spider-Man really needed to look like Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, someone from the Sex Pistols.  He sort of screamed them in the way he was depicted, right down to the multi-media used around him.\r\n\r\nThey really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  I mean, throw us a bone here.  He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's not bad.  Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he's developed the moniker \"Mild Morales.\"  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here).  \r\n\r\nBut he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.\r\n\r\nIt also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed. \r\n\r\nAnd I am still very upset over how Peter is portrayed, but they are slowly redeeming his character.\r\n\r\nOver-all though, it's not bad.  It's better than just about all of the current Super-Hero movies and, honestly, it's probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in... because it isn't totally political BS.", "I don\u2019t have that much to say about \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d, the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d except that it\u2019s easily one of the best films of the year. It\u2019s the type of achievement in animation that\u2019s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it\u2019s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.\r\n\r\nMiles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he\u2019s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn\u2019s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.\r\n\r\nThe plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don\u2019t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it\u2019s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they\u2019re a great onscreen duo.\r\n\r\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn\u2019t one misstep to be found.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d is the type of film that proves animation isn\u2019t just for kids, and it\u2019s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It\u2019s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore", "Incredible non stop action movie", "\u201cIt\u2019s like if The Raid met Into The Spiderverse\u201d", "I mean, it's not bad.  It has the message, but it isn't screamed at you at the top of it's lungs like most movies are these days.  In fact, it's so subtle that it's not even much of a distraction.  \r\n\r\nNot that it doesn't have it's distractions.  It has the same \"because the plot needs it\" occurrences that make you roll your eyes that seem to plague just about every movie these days... but even that is sort of muted.\r\n\r\nThe themes are fun and decent enough where you would actually want your kids to see it... and in the end it doesn't try to do anything new, it just attempts to make itself into a fun and enjoyable film.  That's really all I ask for in movies, especially these days.  I want to have fun at the box office again, and this movie delivers that.\r\n\r\nIt's just... you forgot it was even released didn't you?\r\nAnd you hardly ever heard of the character.  There was next to no publicity.  It wasn't really advertised, it came at a time when people were burned out from all the political super hero movies, and let's face it, everyone is sick of the huge CGI fight with the huge CGI villain/army.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end you had a bit of a flop, and an undeserving one at that, because the movie is fun, it does entertain, and it deserved more than it got.", "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-mi-dead-reckoning-part-one-is-a-summer-blockbuster-in-its-purest-form/\r\n\r\n\"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers precisely what it set out to do: stunningly frenetic, relentless on-location action with adrenaline-charged energy levels. A 163-minute runtime rarely feels this light, thanks to the contributions of the sublime cast \u2013 Hayley Atwell is outstanding \u2013 and the truly memorable score that elevates all the otherworldly set pieces.\r\n\r\nIt has the \"problem\" of being the first of two parts, with some unnatural, repetitive exposition scenes that get in the way of its progress, in addition to a somewhat generic, ambiguous narrative around A.I.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it's a summer blockbuster in its purest form, as you'd expect from the icon Tom Cruise, to whom we owe our allegiance.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "The Tom Cruise \u201cMission Impossible\u201d franchise is one of reliable quality and equally dependable \u201cforgettable-ness.\u201d I\u2019ve seen every film, yet my memory is fuzzy when I try to recall what happened in any of them. And while it\u2019s almost a given that \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d will somehow sadly meet a similar fate, it\u2019s still one of the best of the bunch. Not one thing disappointed me about this seventh installment in the series, an exciting and entertaining ride that gets almost everything right. This is an absolutely terrific action movie that overdelivers, and I loved every minute of it.\r\n\r\nWorld class field agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) works as a field agent for an elite, top-secret branch of the CIA called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). His team, including associates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) have become close friends, and they\u2019re a well-oiled machine when working together. They regroup to embark on a dangerous mission to track down a new weapon that threatens all of humanity. The entire world is at stake, and Ethan must find a device before it falls into the wrong hands while dealing with some dark skeletons of his own past.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the most enjoyment out of the film, it\u2019s best not to read too much about the plot. What works so well about the story is that it has a modern angle, and the motivations of the villains are extremely strong. The stakes are high and there\u2019s a very real danger, which adds to the overall excitement. As one character puts it, they\u2019re fighting \u201can enemy that\u2019s everywhere and nowhere.\u201d It\u2019s smart, sophisticated, and polished in a way that tends to evade your typical summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nThere are a few high tech, double cross, master of disguise elements, but they aren\u2019t used as a distracting gimmick (as they sometimes have been in previous MI films). The high-concept action scenes are energetic and absolutely thrilling, making for some very clever and inventive spectacles. From a dramatic footrace through the canals of Venice to motorcycle jumps in the Austrian Alps to an epic car chase through the streets of Rome, there\u2019s never a dull moment. There\u2019s an inspired, extended sequence on a runaway train that will go down in history as one of the most creative and fun action scenes of the year, if not ever.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of strong female characters in the story, including the new addition of Grace (Hayley Atwell), a crackerjack larcenist, and Paris (Pom Klementieff), a fierce bodyguard who gives off strong Harley Quinn vibes. This movie, simply put, is packed with badass women. Seeing the gang reunited is always fun, and Pegg and Rhames have created characters that feel like old friends. There\u2019s excellent work from the supporting cast too (Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, and Shea Whigham). Cruise is starting to show his age, but he\u2019s still one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest working superstars. His performance is reliable, charismatic, and believable, which is exactly what it needs to be.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clear that this is a movie that\u2019s older and wiser and in turn, it\u2019s made with more mature audiences in mind. Nothing is dumbed down, the emotional meter runs high, and the level of style and poise is unexpected and welcome (and to be commended). This is a classic espionage thriller that achieves a balance between artistry and pleasure, which is no easy feat.\r\n\r\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning\u201d is the first part of a two part saga, but the finale isn\u2019t so open-ended that it leads to frustration. Instead, it\u2019s more of an excitement-based cliffhanger that\u2019ll leave you salivating for the second half. This is a movie that could stand alone, but I\u2019m awfully glad it doesn\u2019t.", "It was a good movie. Not better than the pervious one. But loved it", "Good stuntwork as usual from this series and the performances were well done and nice seeing the return of Henry Czeny as Kittridge and filling in the gaps from the first movie and that deal made with Max. They did a decent enough job with a villain that was essentially A.I. by giving it a face with Esai Morales's Gabriel character, albeit compared with the others in the franchise, was pretty weak. And for Cruise, he's at home as Ethan Hunt while the rest of the team had their moments.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback is some of the dialogue, especially during the intelligence agencies meeting, felt stilted probably because it was basically exposition dump.\r\n\r\nIt's not on the level of the past few movies but still entertaining, just had hoped the splitting of two movies thing was over and done with or at least was made justifiable (like Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame), which I'm not sure it is here. **3.75/5**"]}}; }
