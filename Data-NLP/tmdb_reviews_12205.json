This scared my son, a budding horror-film aficionado himself, surprisingly much more than I felt more horrific films he has watched did, and gave him nightmares for a while afterwards.\r\n\r\nAs much as I love Jennifer Connelly and Walter Salles' work, I will try and avoid the English-language remake simply on general principle.", "created_at": "2016-07-02T19:11:53.263Z"}]
