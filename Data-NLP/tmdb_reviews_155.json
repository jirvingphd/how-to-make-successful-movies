It is the very finest comic-book character movie ever made. Knowing the Burton, Donner and Nolan filmic adaptations of Batman and Superman exist helps me to sleep at night. They are Exhibit A of 'How to Make a Comic-Book Movie'. Nothing else has ever come even remotely close. These seven films (I include 'Superman II' because it was mostly Donner's work)--and Nolan's trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie. They are the easiest for an audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition.

Christopher Nolan has brought us the Batman trilogy that it made it feel it could happen today. Christian Bale returns as Batman, was able to perform as wonderfully as he did in Batman Begins.

His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how \u201che got his scars?\u201d. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the story.

His portrayal of the malevolent \"Joker' is confident and highly entertaining, treading a fine line between supreme intellect and total insanity with considerable aplomb. He comes back to terrorise \"Gotham\" after \"Batman\" (Christian Bale), \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) - now Commissioner in charge of the police force, and newly installed District Attorney \"Dent\" (Aaron Eckhart) had made progress getting the criminals off the street. The \"Joker\", meantime, decides that the best strategy is to rob the mob - and pitching them all against each other, and with the help of the duplicitous \"Lau\" (Chin Han) manages to secure enough of their funds to initiate a campaign of lawlessness that is ruthless, manipulative and good fun to watch. Not only has the man in black his new, potent, nemesis to deal with - but he also begins to realise that his childhood sweetheart \"Rachel\" (this time Maggie Gyllenhaal) is drifting into the arms of the new DA. it is also pretty clear that they are both now proving to be an useful additional weapon in the armoury of his enemy who knows, increasingly, which buttons to press to cause maximum anxiety among those who would bring him down. It's over 2\u00bd hours long, but really does fly by as the quickly paced action really does kick in right from the start. The story is dark and gritty but the pace isn't ponderous and moody - Ledger exudes a sense of peril throughout the whole thing, but that has an edge to it - a sophistication that plays well against the flawed superhero who is increasingly having to identify and cope with his own demons. Sir Michael Caine pops up now and again as his shrewd butler \"Alfred\", always striving to keep his boss on the right side of sanity, and Morgan Freeman continues to feature (sparingly) and his quartermaster. On that latter front, there are loads of new gadgets that still have that element of plausibility to them (no super-powers!).

I guess those fans were poor cuckolds who got jilted by too many brunettes at a young age, and they couldn't get over it.\r\nThat's about the entire story here. Oh, the Joker kills anything he sees. Whoopee. And he's invulnerable. And he's a demigod who can only be beaten by another demigod.\r\nSo, we've got traditional mundane Greek heroes and villains here, just like most Hollywood movies.\r\nUnfortunately, the fans of these traditional Hollywood movies are the loudest people on Earth, and the biggest control freaks. It's ridiculous to believe there are actually this big a percentage of fans for this kind of depressing Hollywood formula movie making, but if you look at Imdb's top 250, you see such movies make up over half of the top 250. Are they voted up because control freaks vote more than non control freaks? Or are they voted up because control freaks use many fake user names? Probably both, which explains why over half of the top 250 are nothing more than Greek traditional idolizations of control freaks.\r\nOh, and Batman turns totally gay, which would be okay if he'd admit it, but he's given the choice of saving a man from death or a hot woman from death, and he chooses to save the man. This isn't any real Batman. It's just another contrived story line for the Nolan Nazi merit badge. They are not even subtle. They bang you over the head with their worship of Adolf and Eva. \r\nGod help the world if this garbage still has a fan base fifty years from now. But it could happen.
