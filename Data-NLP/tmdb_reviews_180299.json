Sounds great, but I think the smaller, contained tale of the original actually served the premise better. But make no mistake, _The Raid 2_ is **awesome**. It provokes more discussion than the original, and the fight scenes (which let's be honest, is 100% the reason we're all here) are **absolutely** up to specs.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._", "created_at": "2019-04-12T13:17:44.041Z"}]
