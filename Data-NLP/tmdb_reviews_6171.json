Some fairly hammy acting, dodgy CGI and tonnes of clich\u00e9 Stephen King tropes don't stop this film from being lightweight fun, so long as you are not expecting a work of art.  \r\n\r\nDamien Lewis is a stand-out, especially when he is being the Mr Gray personality and most of the rest of the cast do well enough, with a little bit of coasting from Tom Sizemore and Morgan Freeman.  It is however hard to look past the patronising and mildly offensive portrayal of the idiot savant Duddits, and the ending is completely stupid.  But if you have a spare couple of hours there are worse ways to spend time.  \r\n\r\nB grade film with an A grade cast and a budget somewhere in between.", "created_at": "2018-01-03T06:38:12.652Z"}, {"movie_id": 6171, "review_id": "62dfaba833a533051fba20ae", "author_rating": 1.0, "review_text": "This is all I have to say...

It feels like a classic Drive-In horror flick, but it looks like a block buster. Tone down the budget by a few million and make it a direct to video movie and it would have cult classic status already...despite the people that actually read the source material.\r\n\r\nThe acting is good, the special effects are too good, the setting is cool, but the plot hurts a bit and the fact that Duddits is Intellectually Disabled is inevitably going to put off more that a few viewers.\r\n\r\nReally though, what you have is a great B Movie Drive-In fair that somehow got an actual budget wot work with. And you could do a lot worse in this Post New Hollywood day and age.", "created_at": "2023-01-14T02:58:34.325Z"}]
