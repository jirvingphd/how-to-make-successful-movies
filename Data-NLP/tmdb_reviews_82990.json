In any case, what the hell. In my opinion, this is one of the most pointless films ever made. This doesn\u2019t work either as a continuation or as a standalone film. It\u2019s a massive slap in the face to the people who have supported the series throughout the years. The other films weren\u2019t exactly masterpieces, but they all kind of worked; I\u2019m disappointed to see that this one is just a blatant cash grab. To top it all off, it\u2019s the least frightening of the bunch. If you plan on seeing this, prepare to be disappointed.\r\n___\r\nRating: ***4.5/10*** *(More Unfavourable than Favourable)", "created_at": "2022-11-01T14:47:05.612Z"}, {"movie_id": 82990, "review_id": "64bf112601757f00e21651d4", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "This the baby has been adopted by a good loving family.
