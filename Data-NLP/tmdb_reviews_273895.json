Being from a town that was the heart of the Civil Rights Movement is hard growing up as a poor white girl because some of the black people in that town hold the racism against every white person and do to this day. I've never been one to be prejudice, but some of the people in that town really are and I think it has a lot to do with the fact that Selma was the turning point for all of Civil Rights. I left Selma and I can't say that was a bad thing. I had researched the March as a teen because I wasn't old enough to be there or wasnt even born yet, and I know for a fact they left out a lot of key elements in that movie that they didn't want you to see so I cannot give this a decent rating higher than a 1 because there's quite a few things omitted for the public not to see. The actors were very well casted and the backdrop made me proud to see my hometown shown so beautifully. Still I can't give this anything but one star due to the omitting of certain aspects of the story which are HISTORY and should not have been left out.", "created_at": "2022-07-26T08:49:19.042Z"}]
