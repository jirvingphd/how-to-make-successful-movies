The story, the action, the laughs, and the cameos make The Flash a worthy cinematic debut for the Scarlet Speedster. The movie tone finds its influences more in the Marvel and Joss Whedon realm than the DC and Christopher Nolan universe, with humor overflowing in almost every scene of the movie. Despite the controversy, Miller\u2019s Barry Allen is well done and entertaining, but the film is not great because of The Flash. It\u2019s great because of all the outstanding fan service to long-time and committed DC fans. Ben Affleck\u2019s Batman pummels thugs. Sasha Callie\u2019s Supergirl unleashes her rage on evildoers. But the best part? Michael Keaton\u2019s return to the cowl. His delight to once again portray the Caped Crusader is obvious, and that infectious joy makes the crowd eat up every scene he is in. The other DC cameos inspired plenty of applause from the theater and, I\u2019m sure, will be entertaining for fans. Despite the nonstop humor in the film, Andy Muschietti creates some very emotional and moving moments that help give The Flash a more potent and satisfying ending. While it\u2019s great, it is not a perfect film. The humor gets excessive in some places, and some of the character arcs end more abruptly than I would have liked, but The Flash is a fun, fresh, and entertaining superhero film that superhero fans can celebrate!", "created_at": "2023-06-02T04:24:18.587Z"}, {"movie_id": 298618, "review_id": "6483b43dbf31f250569af5dc", "rating": 3.0, "review_text": "The main story of _The Flash_ regarding time travel and how it all plays out is solid even if everyone, including the audience, knows it\u2019s the dumbest thing in the world to do.

(Mind you, I've been on enough flights lately to find that latter idea has definite merit!). Anyway, this takes a while to get going as we are introduced to \"Barry\" (Ezra Miller) and taken through the family scenario that led his mother to be slaughtered in a burglary and to his father being charged with the murder. Desperate to save his dad from the chair and and to reincarnate mom, he decides to use his great speed to take on time itself! Despite being warned against this potentially reckless action by \"Batman\" (the most fleeting of appearances from Ben Affleck) he goes for it; gets knocked out of the timeline and finds himself face to face with - himself (only much better looking with wavy hair). This isn't the only thing that's changing on the old space-time continuum and shortly after, \"General Zod\" (Michael Shannon) arrives bent on avenging the destruction of his home world of \"Krypton\" on the people of Earth. \"Barry\" has to think on his nimble feet, and try to assemble what he can of the \"Justice League\" to combat this threat. Turns out \"Bruce Wayne\" (now Michael Keaton) has rather let himself go and \"Superman\" is being held in an impenetrable metal scrotum in Siberia. Time to galvanise and get a-rescuing before his future, all of their futures, are lost. Can they all save the world? I liked this film. It's got loads of action, plenty of pith in a script that is at the more adult (without loads of expletives) end of the spectrum and Miller has the \"P\" word. Personality. They are clearly enjoying this, and there is loads of charisma emanating from both performances from a star who bucks the normal trend of being handsome but rather wooden. Miller is the former, certainly, but they bring life to the role. It's fun, and abetted by a story that has some weight and plenty of pace to it, we are taken on a series of lightly comedic adventures that make 2 hours and 20 minutes quite literally whizz by. Sasha Calle gives us some diversion from the Ezra show as Superman's cousin - no slouch in a fight either, and Keaton does fine as he rehabilitates his disillusioned \"Batman\" character using his gadgets and gizmos to great effect. It's so much better than I was expecting and I have to say that I enjoyed the quirkiness of Miller's interpretation of \"Barry\" - nowhere near as sterile and simpering as Grant Gustin's pure as the driven snow portrayal. The multiverse can keep on inventing and reinventing scenarios and the visual effects can work wonders making just about anything possible - but without strong and personable characters then I am sure I will just bore of the relentless repetition of these stories. Miller is different. Sure, we all know of their much publicised flaws, but I hope the studio look past that and commit to a sequel that allows this actor to continue to do what they do well here - and that's to entertain us.

First announced in 2014 and released in mid-2023, it is arguably one of the worst DC movies to this date. Throughout all the problems, the most incomprehensible is certainly how Warner kept allowing such a person as Ezra Miller to be cast as the main role to be the face of a hero. With a budget of $200 million they were able to deliver the worst possible CGI ever seen, and with it a crumbled plot that wishes for more of everything but Flash. \r\n\r\nMichael Keaton has done a brilliant performance within this movie as a throwback to the 89's Batman. And with it, the new addition to the Justice League, Sasha Calle has done a fantastic job as Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), but both get rushed plot points that makes the audience wish for more of their screen time or even a solo movie and not the teenage nuisance that Barry Allen is. One minute, Supergirl rushes out ignoring everything, the other she's at the door regretting her decision and trying to help the rest of the characters. The same can be said about Michael Keaton's character.\r\n\r\nThe movie dives into the concept of time and its dangerous potential, later forgetting everything about it and labeling it \"multiverse\" instead, following Marvel's recent movies like _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_ and _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ and not adding a single spark of creativity with it. But those movies at least have decent scores, the music within this one must have been selected from a random kid's playlist...\r\nThe movie is also 2h 24m long, being completely unnecessary. Various scenes are completly descartable, an action scene at the start was put there with no thought whatsoever and is 15m of wasted narrative that could be used to invest in Supergirl's story (if she is here to stay). Iris West has no reason to be put into the movie. And for some reason they decided to make a bunch of cameos using CGI, and as previously said, that didn't go well.\r\n\r\nIn the end, DC is still the same mess. They can't properly build a plot and create a movie that sustains its own beliefs. Ben Affleck's Batman, at the start, said we can't change our past due to the fact that those key moments that leave scars are the moments that build our foundation and make us who we are.

To my mind, the foremost is the lead character. The Flash's over cooked dripiness, unfunny, goofy antics and fall flat humour, can't quite \"sell\" the concept of him as a hero. If the films producers and writers, wanted to know how to develop a more accessible lead character, they should have looked at the series. It does a much better job at balancing the characters innate nerdiness, with his other, more heroic, qualities. \r\n\r\nThe second point of failure is essentially re-inventing elements of the story from the series and past films. Flash fans who have watched the series, may well find the film adaptation somewhat repetitive and predictable. Equally recycling large swatches of past films, with tweaks here and there, isn't doing anything that \"new\" either.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only real point of interest is utilising a range of past actors and characters, from the franchise, such as Batman, Superman/woman and Wonder Woman. \r\n\r\nIn summary, not an awful film but still a little unoriginal. An outcome not helped by a rather annoying, lead character. This is balanced by decent action and the presence of other hero's from the franchise.

By placing an emphasis on the smarter and more emotional side of the story rather than the visual spectacle, the movie is thematically much richer than the customary loud and dumb summer popcorn flicks to which audiences are well-accustomed.\r\n\r\nIn this DC Extended Universe (DCEU) installment, worlds collide when Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) uses his superpowers to travel back in time with the goal of preventing a tragic event in the past. His attempt to change the timeline has consequences, as he alters the future and creates a reality where there\u2019s no Superman (Sasha Calle\u2018s introduction as Supergirl is fun, but feels rushed) or Aquaman, Batman (Michael Keaton) is retired, and General Zod (Michael Shannon) has returned and is threatening to annihilate the universe. Without the help of his fellow heroes, Barry must use his wits to save the world and reset the timetable before it\u2019s too late.\r\n\r\nThe story goes to a place that that will make every superhero fan groan: the multiverse. Don\u2019t panic, though, co-writers Christina Hodson and Joby Harold have actually put care thoughtful care into their clever narrative, and the idea of different timelines and realities not only make sense, they aren\u2019t wholly ridiculous or irritating. In similar films that head into the multiverse, it more often than not feels like a lazy cop-out where every death or shocking revelation can later be explained away by shouting, \u201cGotcha! It was only time manipulation.\u201d Here, there are real consequences in situations where the stakes are extremely high.\r\n\r\nBarry partnering with an alternate version of himself is a lot of fun, as is meeting DC heroes old and new. There are a lot of amusing cameos that will make fans very happy. The core of the story is a classic one, giving Barry a real motivation to go back in time to alter the past. The thought of being able to change our present by finding the ability to prevent tragedy, right wrongs, and save the people we love is one that is universal, and it works well here.\r\n\r\nWhile the story is engaging, the visual effects are abysmal. The CGI is cartoonish and dark, with inarticulate motion and a dreary palette of dark grays and blues. It\u2019s a terrible looking movie, something that is amplified during the poorly executed action sequences. Things that sound good on paper end up feeling lame, including a silly intro scene of a hospital that\u2019s raining babies. The fight choreography and stunt work is so much better than the computer animated bits.\r\n\r\nMy favorite element of the movie is Miller\u2019s lead performance. He\u2019s tasked with playing an alternate version of himself, sharing the screen with a younger Barry for much of the movie. This isn\u2019t an easy thing to do, and Miller excels at it. This is one of his best performances, and one that plays perfectly into his endearing awkwardness and bumbling charm. Despite Miller\u2019s disturbing string of personal scandals, you\u2019ll find he\u2019s the best thing about the film (if you have the ability to separate the art from the artist).\r\n\r\nI never expected to be so emotionally invested in a summer superhero movie about a character I care so little about, but \u201cThe Flash\u201d has a sweet and touching story that\u2019s combined with a lot of fun surprises, bursts of corny nostalgia, and a bevy of cameos that will result in audience cheers and applause. Strangely enough, it\u2019s one of the best film in the DCEU canon.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore", "created_at": "2023-08-04T06:56:54.724Z"}, {"movie_id": 298618, "review_id": "64e5849be894a600ae72e604", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "There's some good stuff here and of course a good chunk was reminders of my childhood and fandome of Batman '89 and seeing Michael Keaton back in the role.

It did touch me emotionally due to my personal issues going on right now.\r\n\r\nThat said, this didn't completely work due to, let's say, inconsistencies in quality of the previous DCEU movies, most of them I did like but can acknowledge how the studio, in its various iterations, bungled it.

I thought this was great.\r\n\r\nLike with <em>'Shazam!

I guess I was subconsciously anticipating these to be as flat as a pancake due to the suits upstairs focusing on the upcoming DCU. Yet, I've had a terrific time thus far - <em>'Blue Beetle'</em> pending.\r\n\r\nAs for this film itself, I'm not someone who has any interest in comic books so my only knowledge comes directly from the films. All I knew beforehand was the rather dodgy life of Ezra Miller (just look at their Wikipedia!) apparently affecting production. That's a lot of words to simply say that I have no clue how well of an adaptation this is from the comics, though simply as a film it give me entertainment, it really did.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Flash'</em> features a strong performance from Miller, who portrays the aforementioned with quality throughout. I don't remember Barry Allen from the other DCEU flicks, so I'm pleased to have something memorable from the character with this. Elsewhere, Sasha Calle is very good as Supergirl, while Michael Keaton is much fun as Batman. There are some solid cameos in there too.\r\n\r\nI will say that I personally would've shaved some of the run time, it does overrun ever so slighty. That is my only proper criticism though, given everything else from the story - which brings heart - to the special effects to whatever is done to a positive standard.
