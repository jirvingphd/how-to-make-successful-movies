[{"movie_id": 298382, "review_id": "5729feffc3a36808f8002b33", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "> Home is where the vengeance is.\r\n\r\nA stylish Aussie revenge-comedy that is adapted from a novel of the same name. Just superbly built screenplay on a tragedy that occurred some time back, but the movie reveals it only in the third act. About a woman who arrives in a small town where she was born and slowly gains popularity among the young women who seeks her stunning costumes to impress their counterparts. The town divides over her return, but why all the hate is the mystery that the movie going to solve for us in its entire narration.\r\n\r\nThe location and the settings were fantastic and it brought a western feel because of the Australians hot and humid weather. Kate Winslate was very good, her role simply reminded me Juliette Binoche from 'Chocolat'. I have heard people saying it was emotional, but I did not find it like that. Instead, I had fun watching it, not like I had the open laughs, but felt joy and satisfaction for the time I spent for it. My initial thought was it could be overrated, but after watching it proved I was wrong. This is one of the best Aussie movie I have seen in the recent years.\r\n\r\n8/10", "created_at": "2016-05-04T13:54:07.850Z"}, {"movie_id": 298382, "review_id": "62393f80d29bdd00454659b7", "rating": 10.0, "review_text": "Utterly superb! I wasn't expecting such greatness.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Dressmaker'</em>, to put it bluntly, is quality! It has a pulse and then some, I love the feel of the film throughout - with all its quirkiness, silliness and straight up brilliantness. It all starts off very strongly, though I did then feel a (very minor) plateau. However, to my surprise, it shoots straight back up as it culminates with a super ending.\r\n\r\nKate Winslet is top notch from beginning to end with an excellent performance, though isn't alone as the support cast all give very good performances - from Judy Davis to Hugo Weaving. I also note Liam Hemsworth, Alison Whyte and, at a certain point, Genevi\u00e8ve Lemon.\r\n\r\nWhat a great film, full of twists n turns and it has a fantastic score. Loved it!", "created_at": "2022-03-22T03:16:16.384Z"}]
