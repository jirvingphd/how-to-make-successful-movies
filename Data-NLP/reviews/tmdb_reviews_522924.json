I'm usually writing reviews on the old classics, or the old obscure films, so this is unusual for me.  But I was astounded after viewing this little treasure, to discover a modern movie that I would enjoy and give a high rating.\r\n\r\nKevin Costner provides the voice of Enzo, and does it perfectly, giving the character warmth, intelligence, confidence, and a touch of humor.  \r\n\r\nThis is a great family movie, or for those who just like a good, warmhearted dog story.  While I don't personally agree with the reincarnation theology presented here, it's a work of fiction anyways.  And no movie ever ended with a better song for the end credits, so totally in keeping with the themes inherent in the film, Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\".", "created_at": "2020-03-30T21:06:33.290Z"}]
