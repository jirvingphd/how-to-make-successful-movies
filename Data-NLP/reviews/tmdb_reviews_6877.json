I didn't overly enjoy what I was watching, but I wasn't particularly bored with it either. I don't really have much to say about it in truth.\r\n\r\nAt around 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome. That makes it a watchable, if slightly forgettable, flick from 2006 in my books.", "created_at": "2023-02-14T01:39:06.949Z"}]
