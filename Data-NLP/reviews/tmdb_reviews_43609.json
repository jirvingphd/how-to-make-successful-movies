[{"movie_id": 43609, "review_id": "60cb921487e63e00408d7ad7", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "_**Artsy road drama featuring Zellweger & Whitaker with songs by Bob Dylan**_\r\n\r\nAn ex-singer paraplegic hiding from life (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) goes on the road with her schizophrenic pal (Forest Whitaker), traveling from Kansas to New Orleans. He wants to meet his favorite author while she needs to sing again and more. Along the way they pick up a woman looking for her lost husband (Madeline Zima). Elias Koteas and Nick Nolte play eccentric characters they meet along the way.\r\n\r\n\"My Own Love Song\" (2010) is a road drama in the mold of \u201cRain Man\u201d (1988) mixed with elements of \u201cA Love Song for Bobby Long\u201d (2004). It comes across as an artsy Indie, except with a fairly big budget, a notable cast and a writer/director who had drawn Oscar attention in the past, not to mention a soundtrack that features 16 new Bob Dylan songs.\r\n\r\nIf you favor those other two films you might like this one, although they\u2019re superior. There\u2019s enough good to make it worth checking out, like Dylan\u2019s Folk/blues/rock/gospel/country. But I didn\u2019t find the story very compelling. The similar \"The Yellow Handkerchief\" (2008) had the same budget, but is easily the best of the lot IMHO.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot in Kansas and mostly Louisiana.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C", "created_at": "2021-06-17T18:19:00.023Z"}]
