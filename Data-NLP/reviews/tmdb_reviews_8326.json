Miscreant youths are sent to Camp Green Lake for character building, the bulk of which involves them constantly digging holes in the parched desert. New inmate Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LeBeouf) is about to set the wheels in motion that will unearth the secret of the digs. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a blender is Holes, part drama (there\u2019s plenty of edginess here), part coming of age tale, part action adventure \u2013 cum \u2013 detective mystery \u2013 cum - Western and part comedy, in short it\u2019s a bona fide piece for all the family. The narrative, awash with whimsy and enchantment, is triple pronged, and it\u2019s with great credit that the three story arcs are seamlessly put together to create one delightful whole. The child actors, led by LeBeouf, are excellent, really bringing life to the various characterisations, while Sigourney Weaver, John Voight and Tim Blake Nelson have a great time of things as the camp enforcers, and Patricia Arquette in a two-fold characterisation, scores very favourably with charm, grace and menace in equal measurements.\r\n\r\nMature and intelligent kids films are a rarity, Holes is like a little gem dug up in the desert. 8.5/10", "created_at": "2014-06-27T11:27:12.460Z"}]
