All the former are good, each one with differing personalities. None of the voice cast standout majorly but they all fit perfectly and work together nicely. I rate the music used, also.\r\n\r\nA simple yet effective film, one that you'll rate if you find the TV episodes entertaining.", "created_at": "2020-07-12T02:10:51.511Z"}]
