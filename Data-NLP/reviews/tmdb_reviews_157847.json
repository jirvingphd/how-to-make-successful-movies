And as one of the greatest achievements by any given filmmaker in the history of cinema. It's only a matter of time.\r\n\r\nBrought to life from the pages of a gut-wrenching screenplay, Joe is a powerful drama carried by an outstanding cast, and graced with performances nothing short of tour de force.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary filmmaking.\r\n\r\nAs is the case where my book reviews are concerned, each one of my film reviews was set to be written in chronological order. But for this particular work of visual art, I made an exception. This one couldn't wait.\r\n\r\nJoe is a remarkable film with a distinctive score, and a beautiful soundtrack of the Folk genre. Indeed, the cinematic tearjerker is a rare and priceless diamond in its own right.\r\n\r\nFive well earned stars.", "created_at": "2017-03-16T18:04:07.109Z"}, {"movie_id": 157847, "review_id": "5a9830060e0a2630b2001481", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "RELEASED IN 2013 and directed by David Gordon Green, \u201cJoe\u201d chronicles events in the heart of Texas when a goodhearted-but-flawed ex-con, Joe (Nicolas Cage), befriends a 15 year-old poor kid (Tye Sheridan) from a dysfunctional family headed by a hopeless alcoholic (Gary Poulter). Ronnie Gene Blevins plays Joe\u2019s rival while Adriene Mishler plays Joe\u2019s maybe babe. Aj Wilson McPhaul is on hand as the likable police chief.  \r\n \r\nThis is a southern gothic crime drama with a gritty melancholy mood similar to \u201cMud\u201d (2013) and \u201cWinter\u2019s Bone\u201d (2010). The guy who plays the kid\u2019s dirtbag father was actually a homeless drunk who pursued acting in his youth. While he looks like he\u2019s about 68 years-old, he was actually only 53 and died on the streets of Austin a couple of months after filming stopped.\r\n\r\nThe movie depicts the ugly side of \u201crural trash\u201d (aka \u201crednecks\u201d) and is so downbeat some find it disgusting. Also, the film might seem sloppy story-wise, but that\u2019s because it respects the intelligence of the viewer to read in between the lines. If you can look past these issues, there are thematic gems to mine and occasional glimmerings of light.                 \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 57 minutes and was shot in rural areas outside Austin, Texas (Bastrop, Taylor & Lockhart). WRITERS: Gary Hawkins wrote the script based on the novel by Larry Brown.            \r\n\r\nGRADE: B- ", "created_at": "2018-03-01T16:53:26.426Z"}]
