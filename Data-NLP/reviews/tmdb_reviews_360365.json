[{"movie_id": 360365, "review_id": "5fb1db68c15f89004086ee72", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "It has an incredibly cheesy love story, one that has a fairly disappointing resolution in truth, but I quite liked this overall.\r\n\r\nI've never seen an episode of the telenovela so can't comment on how it interlinks with that, but - despite the cheese - I still had a suitable enough time watching. The cinematography, lead, locations and music are the film's positives.\r\n\r\nMartina Stoessel is extremely likeable and enjoyable as Violetta, she's the star of <em>'Tini: The New Life of Violetta'</em> no question. Adri\u00e1n Salzedo (Caio) is good too. The supporting cast aren't anything great, but do the job that's intended.\r\n\r\nAs noted already, I actually found myself slightly disappointed with how the love quarrel works out - which is rare for me, in these type of films anyway. I usually couldn't care less when it's written like this, but man the end decision is unsatisfactory. It makes sense, I guess, but doesn't fit the flow of what comes before. #Justice for you know who.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a (just about) good film. It has a nice vibe to it.", "created_at": "2020-11-16T01:52:40.668Z"}]
