I have liked enough of them to make me willing to try them, but it is the exception for me to enjoy them, not the rule. So a fair action thriller is less likely to hold my attention than, say, a fair western or sci-if movie.\r\n\r\nAll that is just to say as a preamble that this movie held my attention and interest, which was all it needed to do. I gave it a try because I like Bob Odenkirk, though I must say I don\u2019t see him as an action hero.\r\n\r\nNeither the story nor the characters were particular gripping for me, but as I said, it was entertaining enough for me to stick with it, despite the excess of deaths. I am not complying about the violence,I  should clarify, just the body count. It is almost like the director came out before every scene, clapped his hands, and instead of saying \u201cHere is what I want from each of you,\u201d he asked \u201cHere is how many dead bodies I want.\u201d It is almost cartoonish. Violence can be powerful and sizzle in the viewer\u2019s gut, but when there is way too much of it, it loses its power and even its relevance.\r\n\r\nSo although I have no idea if the average action thriller crowd liked this movie, I will say that if you are not a fan of violence, action films or Bob Odenkirk, I would give it a miss.", "created_at": "2021-07-11T12:16:47.642Z"}, {"movie_id": 615457, "review_id": "61166795350398005ce97d23", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "It's fun if you turn your brain off. Ilya is a master of mayhem and Odenkirk is awesome as always so even when the story sputters and stretches for cohesiveness it delivers more than enough fun action to keep you invested.

I'm not expecting high art or even anything particularly special from a standard \"dude goes on a rampage\" narrative but for a film that started off having real impact from the fight scenes (unlike say John Wick who is basically Marvel level superhuman) it gives that up and turns our anti-hero into just another invisible character wrapped in so much plot armor it's hard to feel invested in the events that unfold.", "created_at": "2021-08-13T12:37:41.044Z"}, {"movie_id": 615457, "review_id": "612a378da4af8f00624cc444", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Let me put this out there first, I am a big fan of Bob Odenkirk.

Derek Kolstad - creator of the John Wick franchise - basically writes what could easily be characterized as a spin-off of the popular action saga starring Keanu Reeves, which has its pros and cons. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, the formulaic narrative isn\u2019t unique in the slightest, holding a cliche, weak villain, and a lack of compelling characters besides the main one. On the other hand, it features insanely gory, bloody, well-choreographed fighting sequences, where Odenkirk absolutely shines - the actor performs a shockingly impressive amount of stunts. \r\n\r\nExpectations-wise, it offers the high entertainment levels audiences crave, so I can\u2019t help but recommend it.\r\n\r\nRating: B", "created_at": "2021-10-12T16:12:01.739Z"}, {"movie_id": 615457, "review_id": "61cb39b7647654008fd855a0", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "I have to confess that I like you-f\u2026-with-the-wrong-guy type of revenge movies so I guess it is not very surprising that I liked this movie.\r\n\r\nPeople have compared it to John Wick but I do disagree with that. Sure the basic premise of the story is quite similar but that\u2019s it. To me these are quite different movies albeit in the same genre or even sub-genre.\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is much more classy both in John Wick\u2019s style and the entire setting of the movie with it\u2019s entire secret society. John Wick is also much more over the top in the action parts. Nobody is more gritty and he is slightly closer to a normal person than John Wick.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of a bit slow actually. Well, at least in my opinion. Nobody is mostly walking around moping and looking sad. He also more or less gets beaten up right away which made me get a bit concerned as to whether this was going to be a movie I liked or not. I got really concerned when he managed to get himself tasered of all things. What the f\u2026?\r\n\r\nLuckily he picks up on the bad-assery and it gets better as the movie progresses. Towards the end it gets really good actually, first when he frees the bad guy from the burden of all that ill gotten cash and then the showdown at the little work shop where Nobody barricaded himself together with\u2026 nah, that would be a spoiler, you have to watch the movie.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy is actually quite a good bad guy. Hollywood has been really lousy at creating good bad guys lately but this one, a real far out psychopath as well as a Russian mobster, fits the role perfectly.\r\n\r\nJust to be a bit picky, a 4.9 litre 72 Challenger? Now I may of course be wrong but to my knowledge there is no such thing as a 72 Challenger with a 4.9 litre engine (also a 4.9 litre engine is really not very impressive). Did some lazy writer just pick a number?\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was definitely a good movie.

I bought the blu-ray strictly because Bob Odenkirk is on the cover and as a fan of Breaking Bad (BB) and Better Call Saul, I wanted to see what this movie was about. I had no idea of what the story was, so I started watching this completely fresh. I was entertained throughout the entire film. I was surprised how believable Bob's character was throughout. The other other thing that surprised me was Mr. Odenkirk's fitness, youthfulness and the contrast of this character with the ones he plays in BB and Saul. The story was engaging but not very original. Somewhat like John Wick as I expected but it had it's own flavor of a regular guy with an unexpected past. A lot of the film required me to suspend reality and accept that what I was watching could happen knowing that it was unlikely that it would. The villains were evil and some of the scenes with the villains are over the top but fun to watch nevertheless. The movie ends with me wanting to know more about Bob's character Hutch, his comrades and what his past was both before and after he met his wife and had a family. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Bob Odenkirk and enjoys a lot of great fights and battles in a fast action movie.", "created_at": "2022-03-19T22:14:17.750Z"}, {"movie_id": 615457, "review_id": "627efc14873f000050f6082b", "rating": 9.0, "review_text": "An absolute blast!\r\n\r\n<em>'Nobody'</em> is a supremely entertaining action flick.

He is superb in this from beginning to end. Aleksei Serebryakov also gives a good performance, as also seen in television's <em>'McMafia'</em>.

The action in this movie is on another level, so many creative shots and gruesome kills that had my whole body jumping in the best way possible. The slow mo shots were some of my favorite, allowing you to see every little detail of the atrocity that just occurred. The plot in this film is a little far-fetched, but that is kind of the point since the tone of the entire film is satirical. The entire second half of the movie happens due to chance. The one Russia entering the bus just so happens to have connections to the story's antagonist group. If you are able to stretch your imagination for this film, it can be overlooked for the most part. I really enjoyed how far removed Hutch was from his previous life in the beginning, leading him farther and farther down a path of self loathing and depression. It really juxtaposes the switch in his mind that reverted him to becoming a weapon capable of killing dozens of men at once. You can really see Hutch becoming alive again once he retakes his former mantle and that is all due to Bob Obenkirk\u2019s fantastic performance.
