I mean, there's nothing inside the movie to be hyped about.\r\n\r\nBesides all these odds, there is something in the film. It has an uncountable numbers of clich\u00e9 dialogues, an easily predictable story, so many plot holes, unprofessional dialogue delivery, presentation of some ungroomed actor/actress etc.\r\nFor example: the heroine (Idhika Paul) used the local and proper Bengali in the same scene. Where is the coherence between the languages? No one mixes proper and local language together. This is just one example, and I assure you there is more.\r\n\r\nBut what it really got is some really good cinematography. Some shots are too good to judge. Other than that, I didn't find anything to praise about.\r\n\r\nWasted my precious 2 hours watching this. If I had slept without watching this, the time would not have been wasted.", "created_at": "2023-10-30T14:36:52.338Z"}]
