This one did. \r\n\r\nThe plot is ridiculous. The whole movie is based around events taking place for no reason at all. It was basically 'The Assassin' rewritten by someone while they were having a stroke. The action scenes couldn't save this from being the one of the worst films I've ever seen and definitely the worst movie I've seen in 2017. Avoid.", "created_at": "2017-12-25T15:25:18.562Z"}]
