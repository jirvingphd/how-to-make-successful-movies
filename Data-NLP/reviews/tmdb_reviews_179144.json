They're the best cause they go nowhere.\r\n\r\n.........................\r\n\r\nThis is how it always ends. With death. But first there was life. Hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah. It's all settled beneath the chitter chatter and the noise. Silence and sentiment. Emotion and fear. The haggard, inconstant flashes of beauty. And then the wretched squalor and miserable humanity. All buried under the cover of the embarrassment of being in the world, blah, blah, blah... Beyond there is what lies beyond. I don't deal with what lies beyond. Therefore... let this novel begin. After all... it's just a trick. Yes, it's just a trick.\"\r\n\r\n................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view:\r\nThis may be definitely the best subset of art, applied at the best moment in the movie scene, at the best moment of our living at the beginning of the 21st century. All wisdom said in a couple of sentences, helping us to enjoy life, and understand this way of enjoying as much as we can. Anyway, we do not have any better way to beat the trick of living, than just relaxing, realizing we are part of the trick and we cannot change it.\r\nSo, just go on, time will pass! :)", "created_at": "2017-04-03T12:45:11.819Z"}]
