Well, we are going to remake Overboard....but wait, we are going to switch the characters around...but wait, we are going to make one of them Latino and give it a vague 'Spanglish' remake feel in the process. Oh. Yeah, and of course we are going to make it absolutely horrible to keep with the remake tradition.\"\r\n\r\nLike all remakes lately, this one lacks any real heart or chemistry. I am fairly certain that the actors were told \"listen we've already done that so why don't you just phone it all on, even when you're going the vague 'Spanglish' remake in the remake.\"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Ghostbusters, I don't think a single one of these has actually made any money and even then, the only reason why people pretended to like Ghostbusters was because they were bullied and threatened to.\r\n\r\nThis trend really needs to end. Not because they are destroying childhood favorites, but because they are awful movies.", "created_at": "2023-01-14T01:47:22.158Z"}]
