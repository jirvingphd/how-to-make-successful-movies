Ants under a magnifying glass just aren't all that satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe upside is that there are some very cleverly crafted characters and acting even beyond that.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of probably better movies out there, especially after all this time.", "created_at": "2020-08-13T01:55:29.300Z"}]
