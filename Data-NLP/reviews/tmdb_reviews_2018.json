As much as I like Jennifer Lopez as an actor, we start on the end of a movie I'd rather see with Bree Turner, and I feel like I would have rather seen Judy Greer in the lead, she seems about as Italian as Jennifer Lopez.\r\n\r\nI understand when the meet-cute is a life-threatening situation where adrenaline causes chemical confusion, but this is sort of a head injury causes an almost \"love at first sight\" cliche, but mixed with an \"unavailable romance\" cliche.\r\n\r\nOnce we establish that she loves weddings and it's important to her for some reason, it's a lot of him (not) pursuing her because he's getting married, and her trying to be respectful, but honest.\r\n\r\nThe movie highlights more societal problems for people that can afford big weddings, or, in short, there is more dumb than funny in this.\r\n\r\nI'm not even going to say this is a bad movie, but it's not impressive, and just not for me.", "created_at": "2020-11-12T21:23:15.920Z"}]
