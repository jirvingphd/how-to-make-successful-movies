It purports to be a comedy, but I'm not sure what language you'd have to be speaking in order to get any humour out of this contrived and weakly devised action \"thriller\". Journalist \"Claire\" (Alison Brie) hires security specialist \"Mason\" (John Cena) to accompany her on a trip to a jungle dictatorship where she is to interview the president. Upon arrival they meet the suave and debonaire \"Venegas\" (Juan Pablo Raba) who has his own golden gun - a little less subtle than that of Christopher Lee! Anyway, no sooner do they land than they find themselves caught up in a coup led by an ambitious but cowardly nephew and must now traipse through the jungle trying to stay one step ahead of the military and of the mercenaries who may or may not be on someone's side! This is just a badly conceived mess of a film with the mediocre acting matched only by some dreadful dialogue amidst a repetitive series of ambushes, shoot-outs and a denouement that rather summed up this confused and derivative story. It's too long, but I'm not sure where you'd stop cutting if you started, so I'd have to recommend that you just go find an episode or two of the \"A Team\" and sink some Malbec instead.", "created_at": "2024-01-03T17:53:46.114Z"}]
