All it needed was a little bit of subtlety and it could have been quite a fun role-reversal caper; instead it is clumsy and cringe-makingly unsophisticated. No amount of glamorous location photography can make it any less so. I never leave the cinema half way through a film, but was sorely tempted with this nonsense.", "created_at": "2022-03-27T11:23:13.480Z"}, {"movie_id": 449562, "review_id": "63bf711fdf857c008926c758", "rating": 1.0, "review_text": "It's pretty much a re-make of \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" which was itself a remake, only this one isn't as good.\r\n\r\nIt's actually just \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" that has been gender swapped and, like all of the gender swapped remakes of late, the humor, the plot, the entire story is wrapped around the fact that the gender has been swapped, and done so without an actual story or humor.\r\n\r\nIt's basically a remake with women and the draw is intended to be that it has women in it this time rather than men... and that doesn't work without a story or actual jokes with punchlines and timing, jokes that divert expectations... not jokes that are revolved around a swap in characters and nothing more.\r\n\r\nSave your time, it's just like Ghostbusters, What Men Want, Oceans 8 and all the other movies that have done the exact same thing and failed because they lacked an actual story and humor", "created_at": "2023-01-12T02:31:59.736Z"}]
