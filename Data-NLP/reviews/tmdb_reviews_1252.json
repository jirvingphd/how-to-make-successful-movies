[{"movie_id": 1252, "review_id": "63be04097d2bc10d79fa52a7", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Well a lot of people have pointed out that it is full of cop cliche's... and I won't disagree, but it's a neo noir, and rather than cliche I would call them \"tropes\" as in, it does it's best to hit as many tropes as it can...\r\n\r\n... and as someone that loves the genre in print, in comic, and on the silver screen, I appreciate that.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is Travolta who seems to pick and choose what roles he acts in and what roles he does the Gotti in. In this case, he's doing the Gotti...\r\n\r\n... but Gandolfini does a great job, Leto has one of the roles where he's acting and not being, well, Leto, and Hayek is amazing so it all comes together to make a decent film.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Gandolfini does such a great job with the narration work that it breaks the heart he didn't become the next Leonard Nemoi/Morgan Freeman goto narrator for documentaries.\r\n\r\nIt's a trope filled fest, but tropes aren't bad when you expect a film to hit them.", "created_at": "2023-01-11T00:34:17.224Z"}]
