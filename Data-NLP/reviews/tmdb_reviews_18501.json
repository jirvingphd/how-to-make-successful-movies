Maybe more the book Running Man, less the Schwarzenegger thing. But essentially, it's that story - bits of which have been filmed numerous times.\r\n\r\nThe logistics and the logic in this story don't add up. Unclear rules and chaotic action scenes permanently maxed-out on violence make it impossible to either feel the danger, or compassion with the protagonists during the battles. \r\nAnd outside the battles, there is not much suspense either, nor acting possibilites, nor dialogue, let alone character development. Even the technobabble is off.\r\n\r\nOh, and the CGI at start is sub-par, even for its day. (Hint: If you can't afford to do it with good CGI, use physical effects instead.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want your fix on \"action without too much brains\", watch something like Hardcore Henry; if you want something somewhat clever and entertaining on the topic, read the book \"The Running Man\".\r\nThis movie is a waste of time.", "created_at": "2022-01-11T01:35:26.112Z"}]
