John Bradley (Game of Thrones) and Sarah Silverman (Ralph Breaks the Internet) also contribute to the light and fun environment of the film.\r\n\r\nThe balance between the life of a celebrity and the \"common citizen\" is quite well explored, and the vision of how much fame limits a normal life is the most interesting storyline of the entire narrative.\r\n\r\nFor fans of the genre, it's strongly recommended.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B", "created_at": "2022-02-26T19:00:42.474Z"}, {"movie_id": 615904, "review_id": "630b0b53ca7ec6007bcd2558", "rating": 1.0, "review_text": "Owen Wilson better be careful lest he becomes the go-to for aging Latino MILFs. Last year he managed to save Bliss from Salma Hayek\u2019s strident overacting, but he has no such luck with Jennifer Lopez in Marry Me. \r\n\r\nNow, to be fair, the movie\u2019s failure is not her fault, and she acquits herself a lot better than Hayek did; it also helps that Lopez is essentially playing herself \u2013 a mega popstar with a string of failed marriages. And whereas she isn\u2019t an acting prodigy, nor is, for that matter, Maluma, who plays her temporary fiancee, they are nevertheless performers who know their way around a stage and are extremely comfortable in front of an audience.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that the only genuine moments in Marry Me take place during a sold-out show \u2013 that is, of course, until Kat Valdez (Lopez), having discovered, right before they are supposed to tie the knot in between musical numbers that Bastian (Maluma) has been unfaithful, has what can only be termed as a psychotic break and decides to pick out a random dude from the audience and marry him on the spot instead. Let\u2019s put it like this: this plot is too outlandish even for Wilson, and he has been in several Wes Anderson films.\r\n\r\nThe reason that Charlie (Wilson) is at the concert is pretty random itself; Parker (Sarah Silverman), her friend and colleague \u2013 they are both teachers, or at least he is a math teacher that, as it often occurs in the movies, has only a handful of students in his charge; she on the other hand mostly appears to just hang around the school \u2013, planned to attend the show with her girlfriend, but her girlfriend broke up with her, so she asks Charlie to come and bring her daughter along. \r\n\r\nOk, so this is the hottest show in town \u2013 sold out, as I mentioned above \u2013, but Parker just happens to conveniently have a third ticket available; still harder to believe is that her girlfriend didn't wait until after the concert to break up with her.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that very same night Kat is already the butt of Jimmy Fallon\u2019s jokes on The Tonight Show \u2013 which is obviously impossible because The Tonight Show doesn\u2019t air live; in fact, it is taped in the afternoon and broadcast hours later. \r\n\r\nBut who knows? Maybe Jimmy is clairvoyant and, having seen the whole thing coming, pre-taped a few pertinent jokes. All things considered, you know you\u2019re in big trouble when your movie makes less overall sense than Notting Hill.", "created_at": "2022-08-28T06:29:39.022Z"}, {"movie_id": 615904, "review_id": "631fa7a57fcab30082ed6885", "rating": null, "review_text": "Cute screenplay and fun performances!

The outlandish concept of a pop star spontaneously marrying a random fan in the crowd, feeding the media circus, and then accidentally falling in love might seem far-fetched, but in today's world not completely impossible. Marry Me tries to tell the story Notting Hill for a new audience but falls short by rushing the story and forgetting to make the romance believable. It all just happens without convincing or satisfying its audience. Lopez and Wilson's awkward escapades are still enjoyable to watch but not enjoyable enough for a second viewing.", "created_at": "2022-10-08T00:31:34.894Z"}]
