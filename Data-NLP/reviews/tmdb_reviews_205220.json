[{"movie_id": 205220, "review_id": "641ce012ae6f09010c8dade9", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "With all confidence, the story of the movie is undoubtedly wonderful, and it was exciting and passionate to follow it until the end, but I did not find the dramatic and emotional sense of the mother. I did not find that she really lost her son, but the feelings were mixed. The feelings and sense of losing the son could have been put in the right way better than this.\r\n\r\nThere was no strong flashback showing the mother's life from her son. It was very useless. There are many hilarious moments and a banter link that extended to the end of the movie, which spoiled the drama of the story. I feel that the true feelings of the mother and her son, who was lost and never saw his real mother, should have been respected.\r\n\r\nJudi Dench was the reason I watched the movie. Her performance was wonderful in mixing her different emotions and feelings, sometimes she laughs, sometimes she cries, and sometimes she forgives. She really made a true story.", "created_at": "2023-03-23T23:26:10.189Z"}]
