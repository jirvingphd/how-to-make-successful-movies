It was good...the ending was somewhat anticlimactic, but the bulk of the film was solid, aided by a terrific performance from Otto Jespersen as a grizzled old troll hunter who works for the government and has been growing increasingly frustrated with their secrecy. The special effects also were incredible (here in 2012, when special effects have progressed so far, for me to mention the special effects in a truly film marks them as something special). A few storytelling quirks (mainly subplots that didn\u2019t mean much or go anywhere) held it back a bit for me, but overall: very good, and worth the watch.", "created_at": "2013-07-21T18:30:22.798Z"}, {"movie_id": 46146, "review_id": "535858b0c3a3685601008441", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Interesting and decent movie getting the most of what it has at hand for a probably quite low budget.", "created_at": "2014-04-24T00:20:00.432Z"}, {"movie_id": 46146, "review_id": "63ad9a9c7ef3811f6c156a09", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "I found this movie to be quite entertaining and would like to watch it again sometime. It tells a fairly straightforward adventure story with good writing and fine acting, and even as they fill us in on the folklore of trolls, they don\u2019t weigh us down with it. There is a delay before the total reveal of the creatures and it is worth the wait. I am not a self-proclaimed authority in special effects, but I thought they did a great job.\r\n\r\nHorror is included in the genre description, but it is not the sort of gory horror film I usually avoid. I see there is a new movie out on the subject, so it might be interesting to compare the two.", "created_at": "2022-12-29T13:48:12.361Z"}]
