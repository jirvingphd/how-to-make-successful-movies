Probably her best role in any work she had done, that shows easily the anguish, sometimes semeling without cause and the masks we have to use dya thought day to be in a \"normal\" life.\r\n\r\nAlso it have and explanation as Judd (and multi-activist) herself had major depression thought her life that isn't something that you can \"cure\" overnight, you just learn to cope with it. She lived a troubled life thought her youth and entered major rehabilitation in 2006 - and now with the suicide of her mother in 2022 (yes, in many cases it is something that runs through the family).\r\n\r\nThe major flaws probably are by Sandra Nettelbeck, the german writer and director - herself a depression survivor - mostly know by \"Mostly Martha\" (2001) and somelighter movies. The story could be a lot better written and the choice of Goran Visnjic (lately seen in some series and in Hellraiser remake) as a lovely husband that tries to cope with the situation isn't the best, and the choice of support that only someone that passed thought that can understand what it is is a partial true - because lot's of people can understand that by empathy even didn't really lived depression.\r\n\r\nAs a whole it is something that I can only recommend to someone that wants to see what is to live with major depression (even if we don't \"read\" what is going inside the protagonist head) - painful to see as real as it can be.\r\n\r\nI imagine this TV movie (it seems to be because of some black screen change in some sequences) in the hands of a most skilled writer and director what t could be with Ashely and her acting. If taken most seriously it could be a contender for best actress. Overall for her work a 6,0 out of 10,0 / C+.", "created_at": "2023-11-08T13:04:57.358Z"}]
