I'm not a big fan of criminal enterprise movies without a great second motivator, so for me, I see this movie as a romantic comedy that does something extra.\r\n\r\nAs a romantic comedy, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jason Lee do an excellent job at their stop and go romance, with Jason Lee just basically being bemused at the entire situation and JLH kinda of just being mean for most of it.\r\n\r\nOn the other end of it, while I'm less of a fan, Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman, and Ray Liotta play out a must more complicated parallel love story that lends towards the hustle more than any traditional version of love.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a romantic comedy that does something different, or a hustle movie that has a special spin to it, but there are other movies that do it as good or better.\r\n\r\nI think the key audience for this are people look for female empowerment movies, and this nicely joins that group of movies.", "created_at": "2020-10-03T14:25:19.526Z"}]
