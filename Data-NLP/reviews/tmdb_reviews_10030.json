[{"movie_id": 10030, "review_id": "60ea2d6e5e12000046005656", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nIt's got a lot of sexual based humor, but if you're okay with that, then you're going to have a great time with this one.\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be Dane Cook's juvenile adventure through love, sex, and....dentistry(?), arguably calamity, but Jessica Alba is really the one that makes this shine.\r\n\r\nNot only is she a lovely looking lady, but she's an awesome actor and nails the clumsy girl role down to every micro expression.\r\n\r\nLike everything thing, this movie has its low points, mostly with the best friend character, but it's the idiot's mirror.  You let a character say everything wrong.\r\n\r\nI've seen this movie several times and expect to watch it several more times.", "created_at": "2021-07-10T23:29:50.157Z"}]
