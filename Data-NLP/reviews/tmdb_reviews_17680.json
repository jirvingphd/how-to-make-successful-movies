She's no Brando, but she does a decent enough job to not hate her and actually appreciate some of what she does. Some fine tuning, she might have something going for her...aside from the dubious reputation of Rolling Stones \"Dirtiest Woman on Earth\" And then \"Soderbergh's Experimental Crap\" label...kill a guy for trying something new? I get bored putting together little pieces of pottery and checking the crosses to guesstimate a date. Sometimes I long for an ancient bedpan or two just to shakes things up.\r\n\r\nI'm sure the same goes for Hollywood, and sure, when you try something new its hit or miss...but then I'm getting to the point in my old age where \"The Girlfriend Experience\" looks more entertaining than another \"Oceans\" movie and...really, if it strikes out I didn't spend my money to watch the same old film again.\r\n\r\nIn this case he kind of struck out, but it is 2009, its not exactly like you have many choices at the box office these days.\r\n\r\nDo I want to go see more Aliens and Robots blowing things up, do I want to go see a remake, or do I just want to chill at home and watch \"Dog Day Afternoon\" again? Oh, wait, Soderbergh's got something that's not exactly like everything else, it's worth a shot.", "created_at": "2023-01-14T03:15:09.417Z"}]
