[{"movie_id": 182560, "review_id": "5787c9da92514131c40010d3", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "> When the truth and the consciousness of the world failed to work together.\r\n\r\nBased on the book of the same name, a story about a dreadful massacre in the rural America where a young girl lived to testify against her own brother and then she never recovered from it. So many years later, the case takes a new twist when some young crime solving enthusiastic shows interest in it and that's where the rest of the narration takes its direction.\r\n\r\nThe suspense was the highlight, though, feels like not a complicated puzzle. Brilliant writing for sure. You know, from a novel to screen is not an easy task. Sometimes book fans and sometimes film fanatics will be disappointed, but this was a good film. In my opinion, it was an underrated film. Some people are disappointed, because mainly their anticipation was too high.\r\n\r\nIt was the tall South African beauty, Charlize Theron's show. However the others came into the play when the narration was in the flashback. Since the film 'The Hunt', it is really scaring to see the little kids as the prime witness in a major trial. Because of their lack of the consciousness of the world, the truth struggles. This film was kind of similar, but only the final act resolves everything. Until then, as a viewer it is about trying to link all the possibilities. Surely a fine film for the one watch.\r\n\r\n7/10", "created_at": "2016-07-14T17:20:26.614Z"}]
