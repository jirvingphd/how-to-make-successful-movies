Christopher Walken plays his friend, Radha Mitchell the mother of the girl and Mickey Rourke an attorney of the family. \r\n\r\n\u201cMan on Fire\u201d is a crime drama/thriller that debuted five days after Thomas Jane\u2019s \u201cThe Punisher\u201d in 2004. While \u201cMan of Fire\u201d was based on a novel by A.J. Quinnell and \u201cThe Punisher\u201d was based on the Marvel Comics\u2019 character, they\u2019re both about men who suffer great tragedy and enact merciless strategies to take out the criminals responsible. They\u2019re about on par, but I give this one the edge as it has more dramatic depth and flashier filmmaking by director Tony Scott (which some may find annoying). But neither is as supremely effective as the later \u201cTaken\u201d (2008).\r\n\r\nSome complain that the movie\u2019s \u201cschizophrenic\u201d because it\u2019s like two movies stitched together, but don\u2019t all revenge stories have a set-up for the oncoming revenge part? This one just has a longer and more satisfying set-up.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot mostly in Mexico City.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "created_at": "2021-08-16T19:11:50.197Z"}]
