Colour me surprised. This one was better than the second, and I enjoyed it more than the first one. The atmosphere of \u201cParanormal Activity 3\u201d is similar to the first film, and the larger cast delivers respectable performances. The scares might not be as effective as they once were since the same formula is becoming stale, but a handful of fresh ideas were good enough to compensate for it. The plot isn't the franchise's strong suit, but we get a little more insight into the demon and how the demon became connected to the family in this instalment. Most of the connections between the films appear forced, and there is an overall sense of incoherence. Nonetheless, if you like the first two films, this one could be exactly up your alley; if not, it's probably better to avoid it, as it doesn't add much to the formula.\r\n___\r\nRating: **6.9/10** *(Good)*", "created_at": "2022-11-01T14:42:56.972Z"}, {"movie_id": 72571, "review_id": "64bf00b96ee3d700ac42a32c", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "My favorite one out of the series.
