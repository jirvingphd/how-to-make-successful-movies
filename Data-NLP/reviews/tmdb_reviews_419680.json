A fine watch, nothing more or less.\r\n\r\nThe plot doesn't have nearly as many laughs as it needs, with that said there are a couple of decent bits - and some weird parts, particularly one at the end. Talking of the end, it's very cringe. Mark Wahlberg (Dusty) is probably the best onscreen, Will Ferrell (Brad) does well enough too.\r\n\r\nMel Gibson (Kurt) and John Lithgow (Don) are two newcomers. Both have one or two moments, though nothing more - I liked Lithgow the most. I kinda, somewhat randomly, felt Kurt Russell would've made a much better Kurt - didn't even clock the name clash before having that thought either, funnily enough. Linda Cardellini, meanwhile, is alright.\r\n\r\nIt needed more, but it's nothing notably worse than its predecessor which is always a positive for a sequel.", "created_at": "2021-02-23T00:00:36.557Z"}, {"movie_id": 419680, "review_id": "645eb5be83ee670164ce41c5", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Not as good as the first.
