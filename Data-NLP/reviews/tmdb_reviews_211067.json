House of the Devil was awesome, and Innkeepers is one of my favorite horror movies from the past few years. Knowing about the Jonestown massacre makes this one extra-creepy, and the short running time works in its favor. Gene Jones slays. Too many missteps though. The Vice angle is the only excuse I can think of for using music (they score/soundtrack their docu-shorts, I'm pretty sure) and it makes the found-footage thing way too plastic. Maybe it's just me but I can't stand pretty much any kind of \"Be careful out there boys: you wouldn't wanna walk into the wrong place...\" horror trope dialogue. Most everything here is coming from a good place; you can tell Ti West really cares about what he does (tho never moreso than with Innkeepers), but this probably needed more time to simmer/bubble around in his head. Can't help but notice it's his first movie produced by Eli Roth. I have this vision of them meeting a few months before production, getting drunk in Eli's apartment and coming up with the idea. Still better than most horror movies churned out", "created_at": "2018-04-07T21:25:05.140Z"}]
