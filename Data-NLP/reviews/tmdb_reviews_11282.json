[{"movie_id": 11282, "review_id": "5f60db4bfd7aa40039edc1a0", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Decent watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of drug humor, \"because he's HIGH\" isn't a good enough joke to me, but this felt like a spiritual successor to \"Dumb and Dumber\" (another movie that is funny, but I'm not a huge fan of).\r\n\r\nJohn Cho and Kal Penn work amazingly together, so much so that I'm honestly surprised there isn't a web series of \"Harold and Kumar\" skits (and if there are, then happy day) trying to wring blood from stone.\r\n\r\nThe story has a great structure: a clear antagonist, clear love interest, a goal, plenty of adversity, and lots of quality character interaction.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the content is that it's a series of ever increasing ridiculous events.  The continuity suffers a bit, but its done so well that it feels seemless in the moment.\r\n\r\nThe comedy writing is good enough that it holds up over 16 years, the majority of which is really funny.  It's not so funny that this is an amazing movie, but it definitely makes it work a watch.", "created_at": "2020-09-15T15:18:35.570Z"}]
