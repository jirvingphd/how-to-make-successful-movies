[{"movie_id": 14799, "review_id": "5f6f7943a6e2d2003a7cc446", "rating": 2.0, "review_text": "Horrible watch, won't watch again, and I'm telling you to avoid.\r\n\r\nI don't think I've ever seen so many talented actors, actors I really like gathered in one place to spend so much money to waste everyone's time.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of is that I'm not in on the joke.  Something in the description noted a 1940's something, and I'm sorry, but I should be able to watch the movie without doing research: WW2 takes up most of my 1940's knowledge.\r\n\r\nI don't know anything about Purim either, but I was willing to roll with it and accept until the movie started in with anti-religious rhetoric for the sake of viewership.\r\n\r\nWhat the movie is about, other than making an awful movie, is the sociopathy and narcissism in the movie industry, on all sides, driving it all forward.  While I believe it is true, of the world, not just Hollywood, I don't need a movie about it.\r\n\r\nIt was just a lot of waiting for anything good or interesting to happen.", "created_at": "2020-09-26T17:24:19.944Z"}]
