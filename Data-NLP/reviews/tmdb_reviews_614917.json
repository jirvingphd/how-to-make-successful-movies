Will Smith delivers one of the best performances of his career, as do Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton.\r\n\r\nThe sport is exceptionally explored, taking the audience through the immense sacrifice a player needs to go through to become one of the very best. Technically, all filmmaking elements work together perfectly to demonstrate the physical and mental effort that tennis requires, dedicating a surprising amount of screentime to practices and matches.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the thematically rich screenplay surrounding family, self-belief, and parenthood takes the spotlight. I don't have a single bad comment to make about Reinaldo Marcus Green's film.\r\n\r\nDeserves all of the awards buzz it's inevitably going to receive. Don't you dare miss it!\"\r\n\r\nRating: A", "created_at": "2021-12-29T13:04:48.417Z"}, {"movie_id": 614917, "review_id": "61f07d73f794ad00e8c1c1a7", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "King Richard feels a little too gentle with a favourable look at a key figure in the careers of two of the most significant tennis players the world has seen.\r\n\r\nThe script starts off intending this to be a feel good story though it\u2019s not without some dark moments.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s immediately a folksy good hearted angle for Wiliams Snr. He\u2019s determined yet kind hearted. It\u2019s a favourable view, but calls critics of that can be told thatAfrican American people could be cut a little slack. There\u2019s no doubting the spirit behind the film.\r\n\r\nSmith\u2019s performance is as sincere as the character is.

It struck a really nice balance that felt genuine.\r\n\r\nWill Smith is excellent in this role, one of his best in years. I can see why he was slam dunk to earn best actor at the Golden Globes. The rest of the cast did excellent as well, I was really impressed with the two girls and Jon Bernthal. Bernthal has such a diverse range for acting, he severely underrated in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nThis film was a joy to watch, and I highly recommend.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _90%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_", "created_at": "2022-07-19T13:01:00.343Z"}, {"movie_id": 614917, "review_id": "633f8c031a32480090a29d10", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Super well-done, didn't realize that the father was *this* involved nor that their family placed such a focus on education.
