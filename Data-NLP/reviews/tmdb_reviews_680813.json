Amin recounts his dramatic story through his own words, beginning when he was a young boy in Afghanistan in the 1980s to his incredible journey that made him the man he is today.\r\n\r\nThe hand-drawn animation is a poetic way to not only tell the man\u2019s story, but to protect his identity. Amin\u2019s life, of which most of it has been spent on the run, is recounted in a series of unbelievable events that are traumatic, heartbreaking, and inspiring. That all of these things happened to one man and he\u2019s still standing is a testament to a human\u2019s will to survive, and I hoped he would eventually get his happy ending (you\u2019ll have to watch the film to see if that happens).\r\n\r\nRasmussen has an empathy towards his subject that\u2019s crucial to making this thoughtful documentary work. Amin feels comfortable opening up to him, and reliving so many painful memories about the horrors he and his family experienced during his lifetime gives the film a very somber tone. From his parents resorting to human trafficking so their kids could have the opportunity to get an education to the sadness of leaving his homeland for Russia during a time of unrest in Kabul, this refugee story spans more than a decade and examines the long-term psychological effects of a lifetime spent running away from oppression and towards freedom.\r\n\r\n\u201cFlee\u201d is a personal history brought to life, and Amin eventually reveals a secret that he\u2019s never told another soul. It\u2019s a cathartic exercise of a man confronting his painful past so he can move ahead to a brighter future, and his quest to find a place he can finally call home.", "created_at": "2021-03-09T04:41:06.639Z"}, {"movie_id": 680813, "review_id": "62e9a0fde61e6d0062f1ef23", "rating": 10.0, "review_text": "I loved **EVERYTHING** about this film. Jonas Rasmussen apparently is best friends with Amin, who just happens to be a Afghani who had to escape during Afghanistan's civil war because his father was one of the \"_desaparecidos_\" (to borrow the Chilean term of those silently murdered during Pinochet's rule).\r\n\r\nSounds ordinary? But oh no it isn't.\r\n\r\nNow in his mid-30s, living in Denmark, gay, and having a boyfriend who wants to get married, Amin realizes that to have any quality of life, he must confront his past, and the horrible secret he's kept for most of his life. This film is the result.\r\n\r\nAs if that weren't different enough, Rasmussen animates most of the film in order to protect the actors from the Taliban. Why? Because this is a documentary and a true story.", "created_at": "2022-08-02T22:11:09.390Z"}]
