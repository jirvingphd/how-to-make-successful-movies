As noted at the top, I did find the run time to be overcooked; not convinced this needed to be 2 hours in length, personally. That's my only real criticism though.\r\n\r\nThe score is well done, some bits kept reminding me of the music from <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/toy-story-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toy Story 2</a>'</em> for some odd reason. Not that that's a bad thing, nor is the film itself. I had a positive time watching it and that's all you can ask, really.", "created_at": "2024-01-12T00:04:56.428Z"}]
