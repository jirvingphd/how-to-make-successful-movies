I never liked punk rock, I was not impressed by the negative and destructive attitude of its purveyors and, even though I like Adam Rickman and think he put on a good performance here, I didn\u2019t connect with his character or root for him to do well.\u2019\r\n\r\nAll of this is not the movie\u2019s fault. The writing, acting, and other elements were well done; it just isn\u2019t my style. If someone likes punk rock or music history will probably enjoy it and rate it much higher than did I.", "created_at": "2023-01-02T21:20:38.394Z"}]
