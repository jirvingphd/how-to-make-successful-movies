Thus we have all the comedy that comes with her literally battling everyone, including her own opinions on pageants, as she is being asked to be something she doesn't believe is in her make up. The mystery of who the killer is who's on the loose is strong for a good portion of film, and even once it's known and drama takes centre stage, it's still hard to get the smile off of your face. \r\n\r\nThe jokes are plentiful, with Bullock finding chemistry with all of her co-stars. She's a very under valued comedy actress, and her ability to bond with an entire cast is marvellous to observe. Reference sexual tension with Benjamin Bratt, the jousting hostilities with Ernie Hudson, the way she bounces off of the other beautiful girls, and best of all the by-play with Michael Caine, who is playing a camp stylist and walks in to lift the laughter roof off the rafters in every scene he is in.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't push the boundaries of comedy, but it's thankfully a consistently funny piece of work, aided by a super cast on form who make a better comedy out of what the screenplay suggested it had any right to be. 7/10", "created_at": "2015-07-01T22:07:58.438Z"}, {"movie_id": 1493, "review_id": "62df6d145ca7040b2ad32e47", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "**A good comedy, albeit with an exaggerated and unbelievable story.**\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps one of the most enjoyable and endearing comedies of the 2000s. It's not a perfect film, it's far from it, but it manages to deliver on its promises and offers us an hour and a half of warm and friendly fun. It's one of those films that, while not being perfect, is ideal to watch as a family and doesn't make us waste our time.\r\n\r\nThe script has a very promising basic premise: faced with a credible threat to the security of the Miss United States of America beauty pageant, the FBI decides to infiltrate a female agent there. The problem is everything else that develops from here: the script exaggerates so much that it becomes unbelievable, even if funny. Gracie Hart, the main character, is not just an FBI agent with a tough profile and strong personality. She's basically an almost masculinized woman with the manners and demeans of a troll, who is then transformed into a model (basically) in a very, very short time! It's unbelievable and absurd. Of course, from there, the film unfolds more harmoniously, with excellent dialogues loaded with witty jokes and good material given to the actors.\r\n\r\nSandra Bullock is the main actress and, in this film, she achieves one of her most popular works. In addition to being excellent at what she does and giving us an impeccable job, she had the joy of playing a friendly character, worthy of the public's affection, who captures our sympathy with ease. Next to her, we can still see Michael Caine, in excellent shape and in a character full of humor. The film also has a good performance by Benjamin Bratt, Heather Burns, Candice Bergen and the participation of William Shatner.\r\n\r\nBeing a rather light humor film, it doesn't make a very strong bet on the technical aspects. Even so, I would like to leave a few notes: first of all, I believe that the special and sound effects did an excellent job throughout the film, and the same can be said of the design of the sets, costumes (with an obvious emphasis on the costumes of Bullock) and props. On the other side of the coin, I found the cinematography too uninteresting, and the editing didn't seem very inspired to me. The soundtrack does its job, highlighting almost only the song \u201cOne in a Million\u201d, in the voice of Bosson.", "created_at": "2022-07-26T04:27:00.204Z"}, {"movie_id": 1493, "review_id": "632649502e2b2c007fefc64d", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "**Miss Congeniality easily wins anyone over with Bullock's captivating and uproarious performance.**\r\n\r\nSandra Bullock's comedy brilliance permeates every part of this movie. The supporting cast also delivers excellent performances, with Michael Caine, William Shatner, and Heather Burns shining in their roles. But this movie delights and rises above an average forgetful comedy because of Bullock's hilarious and singular portrayal of awkward and endearing Gracie Hart. Her physical comedy and tangible discomfort with all the beauty routines and dresses make almost every moment humorous and entertaining. The character development, goofy cast, and satisfying conclusion all support Bullock in winning big. Miss Congeniality is one of my wife's go-to favorites, and it's one I'm always willing to watch with her.", "created_at": "2022-09-17T22:25:20.082Z"}, {"movie_id": 1493, "review_id": "64ecc0f51feac100e16bb600", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Sandra Bullock is clearly having some fun here as the accident-prone FBI agent who is roped into a scheme to prevent an atrocity happening at the upcoming \"Miss America\" pageant. Helped by the camply debonaire Sir Michael Caine as her fixer who manages to pull something of the silk purse from the sows ear, she heads off into this lions den of vacuousness, sexism and silliness led by a wonderfully two-faced Candice Bergen and her amiable sidekick William Shatner. It takes well aimed swipes at just about every stupid, stereotypical and misogynist attitude that surrounds these types of events - but it also demonstrates that many of the participants aren't quite as daft as one might expect. Bullock is on good form, the soundtrack helps a lot too - and as light hearted comedy films go; she and cutie Benjamin Bratt just about pull it off. Don't expect a Pulitzer prize and you might just enjoy it...", "created_at": "2023-08-28T15:44:53.985Z"}]
