[{"movie_id": 1989, "review_id": "64d880df069f0e00c7236582", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Now I'm all for a film from back in the day when Jude Law was in his swarthy, sexy phase (and had a full head of hair...) but, sadly, even that cannot rescue the rather ponderous romantic drama. Norah Jones is recovering from a broken relationship; she stops by Law's caf\u00e9 for some pie and soon they chat. Next, she has moved on and he is trying to track her down via New York, Memphis and finally Nevada where she alights on a penniless Natalie Portman. It's all a bit haphazard; what little structure there is, doesn't really make this anything better than a bizarrely soulless road movie with loads of relationship fall-out and navel-gazing. It's got a great soundtrack, though.", "created_at": "2023-08-13T07:06:07.986Z"}]
