A crazy woman obsesses over Idris Elba and tries to break his life apart so he can be hers. The same plot pops up in multiple other movies and isn't really that compelling, but what makes Obsessed entertaining is the final showdown. Beyonc\u00e9, who plays the wife character, gets to brawl with the woman who messed with her family. The film's pacing is hit-and-miss, and the premise is meager, but the resolution is great! Beyonc\u00e9 really gets her payback. It's definitely not a standout film or award winner, but it's not as horrible as the reviews suggest.", "created_at": "2022-10-29T04:07:07.799Z"}]
