Zhong decides to meet up with Miao at the bar but no sooner has he got there that a hostage situation occurs in the bar and Zhong, Miao and the other guests are trapped inside.\r\n\r\nAll is not as it seems though as Zhong discovers not only is Wu Jiang behind the plot but everyone in the club may have more to do with the hostage situation than he once thought.  Can Zhong save his relationship with his daughter and save the hostages before its to late?\r\n\r\nThe film gave Jackie Chan his biggest opening weekend on the mainland and in 3D to boot, not that it needs to be in 3D to enjoy this film.  Ok firstly if your after another Police Story 1, 2 or 3 sorry your not going to get that, what you will get is a tense, moody and laughter light story about a Cop whose trying to reconcile his past with his daughter.
