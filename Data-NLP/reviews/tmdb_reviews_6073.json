This 2001 release features a strong cast, as we get Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts together alongside James Gandolfini, J. K. Simmons and Gene Hackman. I enjoyed all five, especially the first three.\r\n\r\nIt's not a film to be taken overly serious, it's one to enjoy and I got a lot of enjoyment from it - credit to Gore Verbinski & Co. Recommended? Definitely!", "created_at": "2022-08-01T07:24:03.132Z"}, {"movie_id": 6073, "review_id": "655111c767b61345cb4ba6fc", "rating": 9.0, "review_text": "It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen this and maybe my tastes may have evolved but I recall liking it a lot and watching it a second time at one point. I was pleasantly surprised by James Gandolfini\u2019s brave choice of his small role, after the tough gangster roles. I would watch it again just for that. I would recommend this move to anyone looking for a nice early 2000\u2019s romantic comedy.", "created_at": "2023-11-12T17:56:23.507Z"}]
