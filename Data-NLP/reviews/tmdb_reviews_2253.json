Despite this, Cruise is solid in the role and the story works up some quality suspense. Even though we know the plot will fail, you can't help but root for the dissenters' success. Almost 5000 Germans were subsequently executed on grounds of treason for the failed attempt, although not all of them were connected to this specific conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe film is both entertaining and educational. It shows that there were thousands of Germans who were willing to risk all to get that lunatic out of office. And they almost succeeded. \"Valkyrie\" is reminiscent of 1976's \"The Eagle has Landed\" in some ways so, if you liked that one, you'll probably appreciate \"Valkyrie.\" I like the '76 film a little better.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 1 minute and was shot in Germany, Czech Republic and California. WRITERS: Christopher McQuarrie & Nathan Alexander.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "created_at": "2018-06-29T19:25:41.721Z"}]
