If you liked the first film, you'll get a chuckle out of this one. It's typical sequel fanfare, and an enjoyable watch for kids this Easter.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-peter-rabbit-2-the-rebel-rabbit-is-back", "created_at": "2021-03-23T23:21:22.463Z"}, {"movie_id": 522478, "review_id": "659455901cac8c64410c8e28", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "\"Tom\" (Domhnall Gleeson) and \"Bea\" (Rose Byrne) are now happily married and with \"Peter\" et al are now all co-existing merrily in the garden with no gate. \"Bea\" has written a book about their adventures but \"Peter\" is a bit fed up always being seen as the bad influence so when the folks go off for a trip, he absconds to the local town where he alights on a gang who appreciate his unique brand of naughtiness. When they return and spot he's missing, the family are soon on his fluffy tail risking life and limb to recover him from his new sticky-fingered mates. The animation here is actually quite good with plenty of fun action, some daft frolics and a decent chemistry between the humans as they have to deal with the missing \"Peter\" and publisher \"Nigel\" (David Oyelowo) who would paint a rather different picture of their rustic idyll to make more cash. It's quickly paced and though maybe just a little too politically correct and earnest at times, is still quite an enjoyable family movie with some engaging characters that you'll forget quickly so be able to watch again.", "created_at": "2024-01-02T18:27:28.643Z"}]
