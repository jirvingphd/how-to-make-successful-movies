Unbeknownst to them, Michael is still alive and has returned to his home town after stopping by the asylum to visit Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis). \r\n\r\n\"Halloween Resurrection\" (2002) is the seventh installment of the Michael Myers saga (not counting the unrelated \u201cSeason of the Witch\u201d) and is the final film in the series until the remakes. It gets a lot of hate because of what happens in the opening act and the inclusion of Busta Rhymes, but it\u2019s serviceable and definitely superior to the lousy \u201cHalloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\u201d (1995). It\u2019s just kinda unimaginative and cartoonish with several bits being hackneyed or predictable by this point.  \r\n\r\nThe feminine department includes Daisy McCrackin (Donna), Katee Sackhoff (Jen), Bianca Kajlich (Sara), and Tyra Banks (Nora). The beautiful women wandering around a rundown domicile and dying one-by-one is reminiscent of \u201cDeath Tunnel\u201d (2005) but without the amazing cinematic artistry (even though it cost $11.5 million MORE), not to mention \u201cDeath Tunnel\u201d has better women.\r\n\r\n\"Halloween 4\" (1988) is easily the most entertaining of the original series, followed by \"Halloween 5\" (1989) and \u201cH20\u201d (1998).\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot mostly in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area with the Hillcrest Academy sequence done at Silver Lake, Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nGRADE: C", "created_at": "2021-09-13T17:39:01.615Z"}]
