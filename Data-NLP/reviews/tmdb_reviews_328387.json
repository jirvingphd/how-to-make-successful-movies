Which makes me wonder, in four years from when _Nerve_ was made (where the film is set), will it still be at all applicable? Already the social media it makes use of has changed from the time of filming to the date of release... Food for thought...\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, the movie itself: Just okay.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, at best, intrusive. The premise is old hat (although the exact way it's done is new). The message is a little blunt-force (though certainly not to Tomorrowland levels). The plot isn't quite solid. The acting is usually on par, though does occasionally slip. Many character interactions are overtly clich\u00e9d, and the filming style, while moderately original, is distracting.\r\n\r\nBt it's still fun, and a little warming. I don't regret paying to watch it in cinemas, but keep in mind that's only because I did so at the \"Movie of the Week\" discounted price.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._", "created_at": "2016-09-26T02:29:00.877Z"}]
