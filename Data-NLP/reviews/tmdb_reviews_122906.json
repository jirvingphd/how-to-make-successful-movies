It was that good!**\r\n\r\nA Delightful, sweet, and optimistic film with an uplifting focus on cherishing time with people we love and valuing family. It\u2019s rare to find a movie that depicts a healthy, caring relationship between family members, so I enjoyed seeing support rather than drama. Expanding the focus of love beyond the main couple to their friends and family is not typical of a romantic comedy but welcomed and appreciated. A great escape film that reminds you what matters most are the people closest to you.", "created_at": "2022-08-19T23:21:40.970Z"}, {"movie_id": 122906, "review_id": "647a515b17497300a818cee1", "rating": 4.0, "review_text": "kind of a dumb movie. he has the ability to time travel for his life but he doesnt do anything worth seeing. they also make a bad looking couple too. im not sure what this movie is suppose to be about because there isnt much of a storyline at all. and he uses his time travel to fix the dumbest stuff. not even worth watching in my opinion.", "created_at": "2023-06-02T20:30:19.225Z"}, {"movie_id": 122906, "review_id": "65720fe9fcec2e00fed20f58", "rating": 10.0, "review_text": "What.an.adorable.movie.", "created_at": "2023-12-07T18:33:13.681Z"}]
