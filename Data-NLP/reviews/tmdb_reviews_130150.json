How will their Labor Day weekend go? James Van Der Beek has a small role as a cop.\r\n\r\n\u201cLabor Day\u201d (2013) is a superb adult-oriented drama with an understated sense of possible menace mixed with a little romance. There are elements of \u201cA Perfect World\u201d (1993), \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d (1995), \u201cMacho Callahan\u201d (1970) and \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" (2012). \r\n\r\nThis is a spiritual movie about the tragedies and blisses of the human experience. Masculinity is portrayed in a positive way for a change while not neglecting to illustrate its potential drawbacks. Winslet is excellent in her role; she gets more beautiful as she ages. Meanwhile the stunning Maika Monroe has a peripheral role. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot mostly in Massachusetts (e.g. Shelburne Falls), as well as Salem, New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-", "created_at": "2019-08-21T19:32:05.594Z"}]
