There's a lot of silly sort of conveniences that did bother me some, but it also made me feel something, which I don't often get out of modern-day kids' movies. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2019-12-29T02:47:59.093Z"}, {"movie_id": 431580, "review_id": "658d2dbf2afb25600e0c8eac", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "When a yeti manages to escape from a compound he is terrified and hides out on the roof of a city building where he encounters a young girl. She likes to leave her apartment below and come up to escape, plan her trek to China and to play her violin. \"Yi\" spots the big furry white hand and soon both are as afraid as the other. That quickly passes and soon the two, and her neighbours \"Peng\" and \"Jin\" and embarked on a boat and primed for some adventures trying to get their new pal back to Mount Everest. Meantime, of course, the people it escaped from are bent on recapture and using state-of-the-art technology are soon on their trail. This is one of those gently evolving stories of friendship and inter-reliance peppered with some lovely scenery and just a hint of menace from the pursing \"Dr. Zara\". The yeti performs some feats of chilly blue magic and proves that he's not a beastie to cross as their journey takes a circuitous route back to colder climes. The animation style is simple with loads of emphasis on the faces and there's a bit of humour now and again to help sustain it. There's little new here, though - it's all just a bit on the predictable side, but I rather liked our furry white friend and as movies about bonding go - this isn't at all bad.", "created_at": "2023-12-28T08:11:43.829Z"}]
