Unfortunately, the manor\u2019s past interrupts their enjoyment of their new home. The cast is rounded out by Stephen Dorff, Juliette Lewis, Dana Eskelson, Christopher Plummer and Kristen Stewart (who was 12 years-old during shooting).\r\n\r\n\u201cCold Creek Manor\u201d (2003) is a drama/thriller with a bit o\u2019 horror that mixes \u201cWhat Lies Beneath\u201d (2000) and \u201cThe Messengers\u201d (2007) with \u201cUndertow\u201d (2004). Instead of cabin-in-the-woods, it\u2019s a manor-in-the-woods flick, but don\u2019t expect over-the-top slasher antics (e.g. silent masked killer with a machete), as this one\u2019s more low-key and realistic, albeit saddled with eye-rolling thriller/horror clich\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nIf you can roll with that flaw and a laughably executed snake sequence, this is pretty much on par with \u201cWhat Lies Beneath\u201d and \u201cThe Messengers\u201d although it lacks the artistry of \u201cUndertow.\u201d Stephen Dorff is outstanding and the movie brings to life the small town/rural area with the residents thereof. People criticize the casting of gruff Dennis Quaid as a \u201cwuss,\u201d but he\u2019s not a wuss; he\u2019s just not rash because he knows a reckless social mistake can bring life-changing tragedy in seconds. Most other nitpicks can be just as easily explained. For instance, a person can\u2019t very well push someone into a well if they\u2019re no longer in the area.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot at Cruickston Park, Cambridge, Ontario, and places nearby in the Kitchener/Cambridge region with studio stuff done in Toronto, which is just an hour\u2019s drive east.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "created_at": "2021-11-13T19:58:11.034Z"}, {"movie_id": 12767, "review_id": "62653c98713ed400aa1e66d0", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "I always had a bit of a crush on Stephen Dorff, and his topless torso helps this start off quite promisingly. Sadly, that is the undoubted highlight in this otherwise really poor horror mystery. \"Cooper\" (Dennis Quaid) and his wife \"Leah\" (Sharon Stone) take their kids from the city to live in an old rural manor house. It needs a bit of work, and they hire in the son of the former owner \"Dale\" (Dorff) to help out. That's mistake number one as we quickly discover that this house might not be the family's most shrewd purchase. Mike Figgis tries quite hard to build and sustain a sense of menace here, but he is completely let down by a storyline that is far too thinly stretched and by a really lacklustre effort from both Stone and the really weak Quaid. It doesn't so much end, as just peter out - I couldn't have cared less about any of them and once Dorff put his shirt on, my interest waned completely. An early outing for Kristen Stewart and a pointless one for Christopher Plummer (who didn't even have to get out of bed) add quite literally nothing to this mundane thriller that is really light on thrill.", "created_at": "2022-04-24T12:03:36.023Z"}]
