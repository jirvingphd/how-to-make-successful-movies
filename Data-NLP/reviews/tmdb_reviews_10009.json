It does get a bit too melancholic in moments where it doesn't need to be or where it's not set up perfectly. It can also feel a little predictable, but the twist is decent enough. Animation-wise it's fine, while that early aspect ratio stuff is oddly done.\r\n\r\nThe voice cast aren't amazing, despite the talents of Joaquin Phoenix (Kenai) and Michael Clarke Duncan (Tug). Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas are pretty amusing as Rutt and Tuke though. As a whole, I just don't feel the voices suit the characters greatly.\r\n\r\nThe pacing is pretty good while Phil Collins does a satisfactory job with the music, not sure how I feel about the ending though. Overall, it's very much mid-range Disney.", "created_at": "2020-07-30T12:29:31.310Z"}, {"movie_id": 10009, "review_id": "6592736214956560f7da631f", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "\"Kenai\" is a young Inuit warrior who disturbs the spirits when he kills a bear. His punishment is to be turned into one himself, and be left to wander the wilderness alone. Luckily, he encounters the young cub \"Koda\" who thinks he might know the exact spot where \"Kenai\" might be restored to his humanity. What doesn't help their quest is that his human brother \"Denahi\" thinks that \"Kenai\" has been killed by a bear, and so is chasing his new form with lethal intent. As the two bears start to bond, they have some fun escapades, meet the \"Stadler & Waldorf\" of the moose fraternity and \"Kenai\" learns the values of friendship, loyalty and community - as well as how to catch some leaping salmon! The quality of the animation, the Phil Collins-led soundtrack (with a decent number from Tina Turner too) and the spirituality of the whole thing is breezy and enjoyable to watch. The young \"Koda\" reminded me frequently of a sort of \"Mowgli\" character. Friendly and playful but still staying on the right side of annoying. I also rather liked the denouement - that, too, had a sort of joy to it that exemplified the symbiotic nature of the relationship that ought to exist between mankind and the rest of nature. Characterful animations and cave paintings too! Worth a watch, definitely.", "created_at": "2024-01-01T08:10:10.033Z"}]
