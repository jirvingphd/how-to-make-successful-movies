[{"movie_id": 30018, "review_id": "64b4b65c78570e00ad4c31a9", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "This is a corking film from Bong Joon Ho with an equally super performance from Hye-ja Kim as the \"Mother\". Her son \"Soon Do-joon\" (Won Bin) is accused of murdering a young girl. The police seem convinced of his guilt and her lawyer suggests he be detained in an hospital - rather than a prison - so she sets out, determinedly, to establish his innocence. As she takes to her task, she soon becomes obsessed, her own mental stability begins to wobble and we are drawn into a dark, almost sombre, crime thriller. It has plenty of twists and turns, and by the end (which comes pretty much from the left field) I almost felt exhausted. This is as engrossing a film as I've seen in many years, with an excellent (almost Andalusian in style) accompanying score - well worth watching. (Maybe less so if you are not so keen on acupuncture needles!)", "created_at": "2023-07-17T03:32:44.851Z"}]
