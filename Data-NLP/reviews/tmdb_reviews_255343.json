[{"movie_id": 255343, "review_id": "630d6e5aae38430079083a5d", "rating": 2.0, "review_text": "Benicio del Toro is a better Pablo Escobar than Javier Bardem, the same way Escobar: Paradise Lost is a better film about the drug lord than Loving Pablo \u2013 but the latter only marginally. Unlike Bardem, del Toro speaks Spanish throughout, except when addressing Nick Brady (Josh Hutcherson), which makes sense because Nick is Canadian. Moreover, most of the actors in Paradise Lost are Latino or Spanish, and their characters accordingly speak the language of Cervantes.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the movie plays like a remake of the Last King of Scotland \u2013 and is just about as faithful to reality. Nick has gone surfing in Colombia, where he meets Mar\u00eda (Claudia Traissac), and it's love at first sight. Little does Nick know that Mar\u00eda is Escobar\u2019s \u2018almost-like-a-daughter-to-me\u2019 niece. Yada yada yada the young, wide-eyed foreigner is seduced by the superficially affable and charismatic sociopath, only to discover sooner rather than later that there is no such thing as a free lunch.\r\n\r\nNow, del Toro can conjure affability, charisma, and sociopathy at the drop of hat, and he doesn't need to be in every scene to steal the movie; conversely, he couldn't save the film even if he did appear in every scene, because the story isn't about him, so Escobar doesn't so much inhabit the movie as he hovers over it, like a bird of prey.\r\n\r\nAs for Nick and Mar\u00eda, they are as make-believe as James McAvoy\u2019s character in the Last King of Scotland. We don\u2019t care what happens to them anymore than writer/director Andrea Di Stefano cares about what happens to Escobar, who literally and figuratively gets away with murder.", "created_at": "2022-08-30T01:56:42.855Z"}]
