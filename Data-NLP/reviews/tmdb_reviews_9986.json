Sure, he's a happy-go-lucky guy and social trend setter, but he's a character that needs a lot of help and doesn't even really give back.\r\n\r\nThe story feels like a more modern fable: there is a lesson of morality and life here, but it is a lot more subtle than I'm used to fables being.  Of course this has a cooked in version of explaining life and death to young children, but it feels like it tries to convey that a life well served, however short, is good life.  This does make the movie oddly charming, but I can't say that it makes it as great as I remember the book being.\r\n\r\nNow, that may be nostalgia glasses, or maybe I have them for the this movie, but I think, in the end, it's an average movie with a good story that kids might like.", "created_at": "2020-07-24T13:58:31.893Z"}]
