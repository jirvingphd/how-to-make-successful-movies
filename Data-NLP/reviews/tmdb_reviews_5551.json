I was anticipating more based on the cast, but even they are a little underwhelming. it's relative to what I was expecting, as Eastwood is still solid, Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland too, and the plot is satisfactory; even if I would've shaved off 15-25 minutes. An interesting piece of casting, btw, is the film debut of one Jon Hamm.\r\n\r\nBorderline forgettable, but nothing bad. It narrowly gets a 3* rating from yours truly.", "created_at": "2022-02-08T00:07:46.310Z"}]
