The \"hyperspeed\" effect itself and it's presentation in the movie is amazing, even with the \"mad scientist\" trope accompanying it.\r\n\r\nThe cast isn't bad by far, but, for this, they could have been quite better to really sell the effects and create a better atmosphere for the story.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is good, it makes a lot of sense, the character interaction is pretty good, and it actually structures a compelling narrative.\r\n\r\nIt's not like the production value is bad either; this is a good example of being able to tick all the boxes and still falling short without actually failing.", "created_at": "2020-08-17T18:04:21.445Z"}]
