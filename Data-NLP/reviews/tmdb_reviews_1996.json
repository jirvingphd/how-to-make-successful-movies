While this Tomb Raider film still has plenty of ridiculous moments, this time, they are more fantastical than cliche, which for a video game character, feels like a step in the right direction. The first film seemed more influenced by Blade and style Matrix, whereas the sequel takes its cues from Mission: Impossible. Lara Croft is a globe-trotting, gun-wielding, archeological super agent, but even with how larger-than-life that sounds, Angelina Jolie and Jan de Bont make it feel more grounded and believable. I appreciated the more practical feel of the effects and incredible stunts. In addition, Gerard Butler\u2019s duplicitous romantic interest keeps the story more unpredictable and engaging. There were gun battles, exotic locations, plenty of expendable bad guys, and an awesome action heroine kicking butt! I couldn\u2019t ask for more!", "created_at": "2023-02-11T05:55:43.618Z"}, {"movie_id": 1996, "review_id": "64ab4b426a3448010b70bdbd", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Equally as good as the first.
