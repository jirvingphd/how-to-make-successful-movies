The cinematography of this film is really good although I'm not a huge fan of the color grading. No wonder why the cinematography is good tho because the director of photography is known for other brilliant films like Parasite. Actors did so well in their character especially Hwang Jung-min and Park Jeong-min! Love their acting so much! I recommend this!", "created_at": "2022-08-10T08:58:02.605Z"}]
