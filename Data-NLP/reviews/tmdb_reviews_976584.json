Whether through his stylized direction, thought-provoking satirical screenplay, or bold soundtrack, the filmmaker once again delivers a highly original, genuinely hilarious blend of genres and tones, and a captivating spiritual exploration of the protagonist.\r\n\r\nFortunate as well to have an absolutely superb cast with LaKeith Stanfield commanding the troops, delivering an impressively all-round performance. It lacks better tonal balance and more unpredictability, the latter being destroyed by an unnecessary opening sequence.\r\n\r\nGlad to know it will be released on the big screen, which is where I definitely recommend everyone to go and experience this piece of guaranteed entertainment.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "created_at": "2023-10-13T13:15:53.147Z"}]
