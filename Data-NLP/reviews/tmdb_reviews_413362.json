Israel, Esq.'</em>.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly liked the vast majority of this film, but even so it would be so much worse off if it wasn't for Washington; who nails his performance. Away from the lead, the cinematography is pleasant as is the premise and support cast; for which Colin Farrell is the standout.\r\n\r\nIt's a real interesting legal drama. There's not much to note here without wanting to spoil things, but I can say it's worth your time.", "created_at": "2020-08-12T00:56:14.549Z"}]
