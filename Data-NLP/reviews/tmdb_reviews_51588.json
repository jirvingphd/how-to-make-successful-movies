[{"movie_id": 51588, "review_id": "5fac2228b6abc4003ef58df9", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Pretty typical and brings nothing new to these sorta films, but it still has more to it than I was expecting.\r\n\r\nI had predicted it was going to be a full-on forced comedy and cringe teen romance, but it actually has a little bit more substance to it. Added to the fact that none of the cast irritated or annoyed me, which is always a positive. You can guess what's coming up from minute one, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it - albeit to a minor degree.\r\n\r\nAimee Teegarden (Nova) and Thomas McDonell (Jesse) are a decent enough pairing, while the characters of Danielle Campbell (Simone) and Joe Adler (Rolo) are more interesting than they seemed to be early on. Dean Norris, midway through <em>'Breaking Bad'</em> at this point in his career, also appears.\r\n\r\n<em>'Prom'</em> may have absolutely nothing special about it and is very plain, but I'd very much be lying if I said I disliked it to be honest. It's passable.", "created_at": "2020-11-11T17:40:56.771Z"}]
