To be ultra fair, there isn't anything truly diabolical about it either - hence the (generous?) rating. It's just so basic and limp that it struggles to entertain at all, I'd even question if the younger audience would even like it.\r\n\r\nThe elephant in the room is also that's practically a rip-off of DreamWorks' <em>'Madagascar'</em>, which was released roughly one year prior. If we're comparing the two, <em>'The Wild'</em> is weaker in every area - and I'm not even a massive fan of that 2005 film.\r\n\r\nAnimation-wise it's disappointing, it's not just dull but also quite jarring in parts. The cast aren't much better, I wouldn't say any of them are bad but none of them are memorable one bit - if you force me to pick a noteworthy member, it would be Eddie Izzard's koala. Kiefer Sutherland (Samson) and William Shatner (Kazar) should standout, but simply do not.\r\n\r\nThe story is shallow, predictable and boringly by the numbers. I expect much more from Disney, it's safe to say. Up until this point in time, it's definitely their worst animated release that isn't a sequel/spin-off.\r\n\r\nNot even the short run time could save this.
