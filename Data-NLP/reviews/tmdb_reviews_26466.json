It proves to be complex piece, one in fact that kind of demands a second viewing to fully appreciate the twisty nuances within. Beautiful photography highlights some of the teasing imagery, which ascentuates the etheral tone to proceedings.

The TV flick \"Ghost Voyage\" came out over a year earlier and covered similar terrain.\r\n\r\nWhile \u201cTriangle\u201d had ten times the budget I slightly prefer \u201cGhost Voyage\u201d due to the emphasis on character and possible redemption, despite its cartoonish CGI. This one\u2019s lonelier and bleaker but has its points of interest, including Melissa George as the lost, joyless protagonist. Yet it\u2019s the brilliance of the concept and how it\u2019s executed that scores the highest marks.\r\n\r\nWhen it\u2019s over, the more you reflect on the details, the more impressed you are.
