And the lead guy played by Alex O'Loughlin was really hot. The story was okay. It was like Baby Mama minus the baby mama. There were some funny parts like the orgasm and the water birth. But this movie is more of a dvd kind of movie than a theater kind of movie. A feel good movie.", "created_at": "2017-02-09T11:53:44.981Z"}]
