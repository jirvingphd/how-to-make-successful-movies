[{"movie_id": 429617, "review_id": "5d16ef595b4fed001e4684c9", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "The whole film is a relentless flurry of action and adventure from the get-go, with the man himself sporting no less than four different spider suits (for all the mega fans out there). Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) gets a look-in once again after her very disappointing absence from 99.99% of \u2018Endgame\u2019, but she\u2019s wasted on screen, serving little to no purpose. And while this film finally gives us a Peter/MJ love story, it\u2019s all too familiar territory - not because of the characters involved but because we saw Peter pursue a crush in \u2018Homecoming\u2019. We also saw him try to balance the student/hero sides of his life then too. This is THIS Peter Parker\u2019s fifth time on the rollercoaster. We\u2019ve seen him and fell in love with him as the sweet, innocent kid who had greatness thrust upon him and his thirst to be a superhero. He had his shot in the ring - several times in fact - and now we need to see him grow, but they\u2019ve just given us much of the same. We need to know where this is going, not just watch a kid play dress-ups time and time again.\r\n- Jess Fenton\r\n\r\nRead Jess' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-spider-man-far-from-home-in-a-post-iron-man-world-spideys-still-the-same-insecure-kid", "created_at": "2019-06-29T04:55:53.596Z"}, {"movie_id": 429617, "review_id": "5d1b48a70cd32a1960f777c1", "rating": 10.0, "review_text": "Amazing movie!!", "created_at": "2019-07-02T12:05:59.297Z"}, {"movie_id": 429617, "review_id": "5d23564b15c6364753f412f7", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is a spoiler-free review of Far From Home, but NOT of Avengers: Endgame! So, if you still didn\u2019t watch the latter or heard what happens in it (by some inexplicable reason), this is a SPOILER WARNING for the events of that era-ending film. Moving on to the web-slinger, this sequel is everything it should be and a bit more. It beautifully encapsulates how everyone\u2019s feeling about the central death of Endgame, especially Peter Parker. I wished Jon Watts would put a lot of focus into Spider-Man\u2019s grief and I hoped that a big part of the plot would be him just having to deal with the fact that his mentor/father figure is gone. He can\u2019t continue to just be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He needs to grow up and become what everyone expects of him: to be the best of them all.\r\n\r\nWatts does all of it. There are so many emotionally powerful dialogues featuring Nick Fury or Happy (Jon Favreau) or even just moments with Tom Holland just standing alone and having to breathe through the pain of losing someone you love. The pressure that everyone is putting on his shoulders is immense, maybe too much for a simple teenager, but he\u2019s everything but simple. I love every single bit of story dedicated to Peter and Tony Stark\u2019s (Robert Downey Jr.) relationship. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers wrote a wonderful screenplay, and Jon Watts executed it seamlessly. However, the reason why all of this works is due to Tom Holland\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nHe said in an interview he would play Spider-Man until he can and until producers let him. I hope he stays around for years without end. He\u2019s not only my favorite on-screen Spider-Man but my favorite on-screen Peter Parker as well. I love how he spends most of the movie holding on to his feelings, and in the last act, he just lashes out because he can\u2019t take it anymore. He left my eyes close to tearing up in probably the best dialogue of the film with Happy. As a superhero, he perfectly embodies what Spidey is all about, and Holland has the plus of doing most of his action stunts. As a teenager, he\u2019s incredibly funny, innocent, and he still doesn\u2019t know how to deal with falling in love or having a crush, which leads me to the second of the three main storylines of this movie: his relationship with MJ. \r\n\r\nZendaya did get some criticism from fans who, well, don\u2019t like the fact that MJ is not the same one as in Sam Raimi\u2019s original trilogy (physically and psychologically). Same for Holland and the fact that this Spider-Man has a lot more \u201cgadgets\u201d than Tobey Maguire\u2019s. For those people, I only have one advice: understand that this is a distinct universe with different takes on characters we know and with other stories to tell which are, in fact, the closest we had to the comics so far. The sooner you accept this, the easier will be for you to enjoy these films. Having that in mind, MJ didn\u2019t have much to do in Homecoming. Actually, she was even played as a post-credits twist so that the sequel could focus more on her \u2026 and it did.\r\n\r\nTheir relationship gradually evolves throughout the movie smoothly and realistically. They\u2019re teenagers! Having their first crush, trying to come up with a good time and place to tell the other they like them, being nervous when they\u2019re together and being anxious when they\u2019re separated \u2026 Watts handled this subplot very well. It didn\u2019t feel forced (rom-coms should take some tips), Zendaya and Holland\u2019s chemistry is palpable, and I love this new MJ. Most of the superhero\u2019s lovers are the cliche damsel in distress, always needing saving and making dumb decisions. Zendaya\u2019s MJ not only can handle herself, but she has an unique personality that makes her stand out.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third and last storyline relies on Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). I can\u2019t really get in-depth about this character because he has a massive impact on the narrative, but I can guarantee that Gyllenhaal makes this character work. I like how they approached Mysterio, but if it wasn\u2019t for the outstanding actor that Gyllenhaal is, Far From Home would have suffered a bit. The relationship between him and Spider-Man is well-developed, but the character of Mysterio lacked better treatment. There\u2019s an exposition dump midway through the runtime that\u2019s just horrible. Really, really bad. However, the film moves on and gets better until it reaches the last 45 minutes, which are unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI will always prefer a slow start and a fantastic finish than the other way around. Far From Home struggles with the first two acts\u2019 pacing, but the last one compensates that with some of the best action a Spider-Man movie ever had! There are so many sequences where our superheroes are just going at it, flying and swinging across buildings, bridges, and rivers like we\u2019ve seen before, only better. The CGI looked like it could be excessive in the trailers, but instead, it\u2019s some of the best Marvel has shown us. Nevertheless, the jaw-dropping scenes are some that involve illusions, very much like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) had in his origin flick. Spider-Man has two memorable sequences (the VFX here are mind-blowing), one of which incorporates a certain superpower not seen in the MCU so far (officially, at least). The kid in me was smiling with pure joy, let\u2019s write that.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s on par with Homecoming. One is better than the other in various areas, but they\u2019re extremely different, so comparing them might be unfair. The first had the goal of introducing a \u201cnew\u201d character to the MCU, so the focus relied solely on Peter Parker having to deal with his powers and being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. This sequel is set so far away from the origin story and so much happened between these two that if people chose to watch them back-to-back, they wouldn\u2019t understand much of what\u2019s going on. Nevertheless, Far From Home still has its own issues.\r\n\r\nLike I wrote above, the first two acts struggle with its pacing. While it\u2019s refreshing to watch Spider-Man in other cities besides New York, the transitions between them are ridiculously fast, especially one that takes Peter Parker to another country in such an illogical way. The film tries to play off these less rational moments with comedy bits quite often and sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work, affecting both the tone and pacing. I liked Ned in Homecoming, and I also enjoyed his presence here, but this time he almost felt like just a comic relief guy instead of that essential \u201csidekick\u201d to Spider-Man. Michael Giacchino\u2019s score is good, but for some reason, I couldn\u2019t really connect with it, which I think it\u2019s the first time I don\u2019t exactly love Giacchino\u2019s themes. Finally, the comedy skits could be better, they don\u2019t land that many times and the one supposedly funny scene I remember is the absolute worst.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I still had a blast! I think I prefer Far From Home to Homecoming since the latter deals with a much more complex and emotionally compelling story than the origin flick. The action is some of the MCU\u2019s best and definitely as great as Spider-Man\u2019s action ever was, featuring some mind-bending, astonishing sequences. The cast is brilliant, especially Tom Holland who cements his spot as the best on-screen web-slinger ever. Zendaya and Jon Favreau are also amazing, but I have to praise Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance because he\u2019s just awesome every single time. It\u2019s the movie the MCU needed after the tragic events of Endgame. It works because we feel what Peter Parker\u2019s feeling and we can deal with our grief with the help of Spider-Man\u2019s journey in this film. Aside from some minor problems with pacing, comedy, and exposition, the last act plus the two post-credits scenes, which have a tremendous impact on the movie and on what\u2019s to come on Phase Four, are more than enough for you to go see this film at the theater. Don\u2019t miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "created_at": "2019-07-08T14:42:19.577Z"}, {"movie_id": 429617, "review_id": "5d277e4dbe4b3612f69e17c9", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Problems: I thought the Gyllenhaal character was corny, Spidey taking selfies too out of character for a selfless hero, and the Fury twist throughout the movie really unnecessary. \r\n\r\nWhat I liked: Tom Holland continues to be a charming actor.", "created_at": "2019-07-11T18:22:05.201Z"}, {"movie_id": 429617, "review_id": "5d2ec9b227d9cc00127d01f6", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "There's a some things in _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ that I personally didn't love.

It\u2019s far from a great movie and the end scene\u2026well it\u2019s a typical really crappy Hollywood ending where the writer cannot be bothered to spend time creating something intelligent so he just goes for the usual sensationalist cliffhanger bullshit.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming, this is a Spider-Man for kids, or at least younger people, movie which perhaps is part of why I am somewhat lukewarm towards it. This one did not feel as childish as the previous one but there is still a lot of teenage angst and rubbish in it. The plot is of course highly predictable as well.\r\n\r\nThe special effects on the other hand are quite good and essentially what makes the movie worth watching. At least to me.

He's not going to deliver your pizza when you go visit your parents.\r\n\r\nBut, beyond that, it's still a fun movie, but one that didn't have as many laughs as the first outing.
