That and too many tanned brain-dead surf-douche supporting actors makes it very corny (And you want to bite your own arm off in frustration after 1 hr).\r\nBut the main actress makes a solid effort, which is worth it. Shoot the rest, and feed them to the sharks.", "created_at": "2017-08-14T01:26:48.102Z"}]
