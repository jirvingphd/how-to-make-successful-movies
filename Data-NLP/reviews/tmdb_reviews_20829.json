It's good to see \"behind the curtain\" of comedy.  The cast is excellent, and not because he strayed from his typical Happy Madison group, but just that they clearly know what it is to be those people and were able to give excellent deliveries.\r\n\r\nAnytime you're dealing with a \"character is dying\" trope, it has to be handled a very particular way, and usually that is overly serious (\"The Fault in Our Stars\"), but adding humor allows the story to be more palatable (\"Stranger Than Fiction\"), but it requires extreme balance to not trivialize the death of the character (\"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium\"), and without being fantastic, this does an very good job of finding that balance, just with more \"dick and fart\" jokes.\r\n\r\nI think this is a good watch for anyone who likes stand up or follows comedic actors (such as SNL actors).", "created_at": "2020-10-04T14:07:55.595Z"}, {"movie_id": 20829, "review_id": "6465573b006b010147e85ca6", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Weird movie.
