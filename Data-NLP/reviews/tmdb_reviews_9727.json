Not even after the two have been violently attacked in the middle of the city, together with a police patrol car, does anyone show any interest in their story.\r\nThe decision to take it directly to DVD was probably very wise, as the film critics would have killed it.", "created_at": "2014-04-07T17:25:01.657Z"}]
