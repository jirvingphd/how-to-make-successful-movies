The story has been told before, but it doesn't keep Red from being fun. The cast is filled with veteran actors that seem to have a blast working together and blowing stuff up. The film's highlight was John Malkovich playing in his sweet spot - a crazed unhinged psycho (Con Air vibes). Bruce Willis leads the team with his usual cool tough, guy character and does great. Even though RED doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before, the charming cast and characters make Red an entertaining spy action movie.", "created_at": "2023-01-02T02:37:28.699Z"}, {"movie_id": 39514, "review_id": "64739a405cd16e0133e1f881", "rating": 9.0, "review_text": "A great ride of a movie. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as Frank Moses and downplays his character like no one else could. Picture any other star in this role and it's a completely different movie. And where else are you going to see Helen Mirren dressed in an evening gown pumping out hundreds of rounds from a machine gun bigger than she is? Exquisite. Oh, and an honourable mention for John Malkovich. Just nuts!", "created_at": "2023-05-28T18:15:28.439Z"}, {"movie_id": 39514, "review_id": "64d0b9b14d679100ff68a0bd", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "There old retired C.I.A. agents who are to be the best in the biz.
