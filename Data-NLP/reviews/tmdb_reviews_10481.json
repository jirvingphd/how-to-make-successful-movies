I really remember the third act of the film before rewatching the film and it is going to be the only thing I will remember about the film. There are two fun scenes in my opinion: the ending and Cruella De Vil transformation back into her evil self. Glenn close is the only great thing from the film. This is not one you need to seek out if you have not seen it.", "created_at": "2019-03-09T16:08:34.952Z"}]
