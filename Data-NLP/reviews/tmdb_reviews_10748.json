Yet when it comes down to it, the old films from the 50s and 60s were hardly comedy gold anyway. Safe family fare and sometimes fun into the bargain, and with strong casts, they have never been seen as essential British comedies and untouchable by the modern era\u2019s obsession with remakes and reimaging.\r\n\r\nSt. Trinian\u2019s 2007 style is not an improvement on the oldies, but neither is it the stinker some critics in 2007 wanted us to believe. It has enough about it to be its own animal, it\u2019s funny, sexy and never dull. This also benefits from strong comic casting, where the likes of Rupert Everett (having the time of his life in drag), Colin Firth and Russell Brand are pitched into the femme madness headed by Gemma Arterton and Tallulah Riley. The writers err on the side of caution as far as risqu\u00e9 material goes, but there\u2019s some very strong gags played out and the grouping of the girls into the various cliques (Emos, Chavs etc) is a nifty bit of writing that is mined to good effect.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was good enough and successful enough to warrant a sequel 2 years later\u2026  6.5/10", "created_at": "2015-02-12T02:47:19.478Z"}]
