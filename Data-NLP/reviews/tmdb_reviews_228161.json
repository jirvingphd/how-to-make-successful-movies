[{"movie_id": 228161, "review_id": "55de10a19251411c3e000274", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "> A little girl and her unexpected adventure with an unlikely friend.\r\n\r\nIt was a good movie, but just like 'Turbo', it was turned down by the critics and so those who follow them. Besides Disney and Pixar, DreamWorks Animation ain't that bad at all. Technical side of this film comes under same league with the other two top production house, but the story and the character are not strong enough. Comedies were awesome, and so the dialogues, the innovation in narration falls short with the same old cliche in the alien theme. The soundtracks were good though, especially that one used for the promotion, 'feel the light'.\r\n\r\nFor a change, the lead girl character was different and voice rendered by Rihanna. I said it many times that my first ever 3D animation was 'Ants', despite 'Toy Story' was the first feature length. And this film has been the best work of the director to till date since his first flick 'Antz'. As usual like any animated movie, it was targeted for children, but I enjoyed watching it. There won't be a sequel at least for now, but I would love to have one. For a change you can try this to get a break from the fairytales and princess stories.\r\n\r\n6.5/10", "created_at": "2015-08-26T19:16:49.422Z"}, {"movie_id": 228161, "review_id": "6131b1fb2cde980062cf4d65", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Utterly average film that was rightly overlooked by the critics. There is nothing much apart from pretty colours. Rihanna is not an actress, and when you can't see her pretty face you seriously notice that. I wouldn't bother with this one, there are leagues better out there.", "created_at": "2021-09-03T05:26:19.590Z"}]
