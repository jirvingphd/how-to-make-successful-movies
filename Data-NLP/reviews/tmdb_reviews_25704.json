Immediately upon seeing the situation, there is an obvious conclusion.\r\n\r\nWhile Michael Keaton and Jane Lynch are almost always fun, they don't have a lot to do in this: they nail their small, small parts, but there is only so much they can do from that position.\r\n\r\nAlexis Bledel (\"Gilmore Girls\") really carries the movie, and she does it well enough: she can certainly lead a movie, I just want to see it in something bigger and better than this.\r\n\r\nA lot of the movie is so generic that it almost feels like, \"they'll get it\" is written in the script.  It took me about 20 minutest to realize its a college movie, not a high school movie, and it's heavily predictable.\r\n\r\nIt's not that it's a bad movie by any stretch, but there just isn't anything special here, and I really think I'll be arguing with myself in a year about whether or not I've even seen this.", "created_at": "2020-09-24T00:26:23.887Z"}]
