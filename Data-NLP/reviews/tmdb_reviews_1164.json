Abu Abdullah was in dire need of a gun in order to hunt the foxes that were eating his sheep\r\nAbu Abdullah has two children, one of whom is called Youssef, and he is very good at shooting a gun. What happened was not taken into account, which is that Youssef and his older brother wanted to conduct an experiment to see if the rifle could be used for long distances, and one of the rifle bullets hit an American tourist by mistake, and America considered it an act of terrorism. This is the summary.\r\n\r\nI felt that I was spinning in three continents when the director was changing between one shot and the other, so the film would go from one continent to another. Giving the Japanese tourist the gun to Hassan Al-Maghribi changed the fates of the attitudes of people and countries, so America went to consider the shooting incident of the American tourist as a terrorist act, despite The smoothness of events.\r\n\r\nI felt that the game of fate is like Biango, which is the probability that you will be exposed to it 1 percent, but it may happen to you, as it happened to Cate Blanchett through a gift from a Japanese person.", "created_at": "2023-03-14T05:32:55.770Z"}]
