It\u2019s enjoyable, it\u2019s well casted and it\u2019s cute without being too cheesy. It\u2019s also the third miss in a row for Pixar.\r\n\r\nMU, just like Brave (and unlike Cars 2) is filled with merit, and well worth watching. But in 1995 when Pixar came out swinging with Toy Story, people expect that sort of a trend to continue. Which it did! Right up until 2006, when they released their seventh film (Cars); the first film they\u2019d gotten behind that didn\u2019t blow audiences world wide out of the Goddamn water. Pixar\u2019s limped up and down the approval ladder ever since, with MU sitting comfortably somewhere in the middle.\r\n\r\nIt is a great film. Especially for a kids\u2019 film, especially for a prequel, all of that, but it is not the return to greatness audiences keep hoping for. It plays it safe, it lulls in the dreary, rarely well-pulled-off format of \u201cCollege Comedy\u201d (which is again, a safe area to sit in). It may not be as triumphant as the original, but it\u2019s not all together disappointing either.\r\nThe film does what virtually any film with large amount of money behind it does: It stands in front of you for an hour and a half, does its job in the entertainment industry of \u201centertaining\u201d you, then it sidles out, leaving you smiling, but not thoroughly satisfied. It takes as few risks as possible, and vehemently avoids anything new, just in case it pisses people off, and risks not making their money back.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s fine, people of the world are used to this, it\u2019s a fun ride, and then it\u2019s done. Worth your money, worth your time, but not what people have come to expect from the powerhouse of Pixar\u2019s heyday. \r\n\r\n74%\r\n\r\n-Gimly", "created_at": "2017-05-13T06:17:37.575Z"}, {"movie_id": 62211, "review_id": "5f132674b87aec00351bdf76", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "A fun prequel to <em>'Monsters, Inc.'</em>.\r\n\r\nIt isn't on the same level as the preceding film, but <em>'Monsters University'</em> is a pleasing film nonetheless. It takes a trip backwards in time to see Mike and Sully pre-Inc. and it comes out good, it doesn't have as much as heart but the comedy is still there at a strong level.\r\n\r\nJohn Goodman (Sully) and Billy Crystal (Mike) are again fantastic, while Helen Mirren comes in as a new character, Hardscrabble, and gives a pleasant performance. I don't love the other new characters, but they certainly serve a purpose and play a part.\r\n\r\nThe plot is entertaining, it drops a little bit once the competition begins but everything is still enjoyable - the 104 minute run time flies by. I think I would've preferred a sequel story featuring a grown up Boo (admittedly not sure in what way), but this production is a suitable attachment to the quality 2001 original.", "created_at": "2020-07-18T16:42:28.647Z"}, {"movie_id": 62211, "review_id": "606d046c1cc4ff0029c83d70", "rating": 10.0, "review_text": "This is a great movie.

So off we go to university where the takes it all for granted \"Sully\" is a natural at scaring folks, \"Mike\" - well he couldn't scare the skin off a custard! Initially, it's \"Randall\" that makes more of an impact on the young green cyclops and, indeed, he and his big wooly colleague really can't stand the sight of each other. A fluke of misfortune forces them to get their act together, though, after they manage to seriously annoy \"Dean Hardscrabble\" who throws them out of scare class. Only by forming their own fraternity can they hope to survive in the \"Scare Games\" - winning them being the only way to assuage their furious professor and get back to class. Loads of enjoyable escapades follow as they have to learn to rely upon and trust one another. The mischievous \"Randall\" shows us some early signs of his duplicity and the competitive nature of the episodic narrative works well at allowing the characters to have fun as they begin that lifelong bond (or not). The writing provides for some humour as we build to a denouement that isn't exactly a surprise, but is still just a little quirkier than expected. Not so good as the first one, but as a re-invention of some amiable characters goes, this is a quickly paced adventure that's not bad at all.", "created_at": "2023-12-09T08:28:15.830Z"}]
