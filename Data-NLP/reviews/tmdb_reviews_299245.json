There's nothing new in it. Even those who haven't seen many films could name a couple of similar films. The best ones. The worst part was, in horror films, ten guys go in and only one comes out. Sometimes none. The found-footage presentation was okay for such concept. The film was short and one day event based. Most of the story was on the night in an auditorium. The initial part had fair space to kick-start the tale with a simple intro. And then the following event did not stay up to the buildup.\r\n\r\nThe basic storyline itself was very weak. The characters, and their behaviours, all easily gives out the upcoming scenes. So predictable, even the twist was ordinary. The way it ended was worse than ordinary. I felt the final scene with the cops was totally unnecessary. There's nothing wrong with the actors. Even filmmaking was acceptable. But I don't know how the production company okayed the screenplay. One of the low cost film, but earned better. Despite not received well by all the quarters. I would always encourage such small films, but I can't suggest it.\r\n\r\n_2/10_", "created_at": "2017-10-09T21:19:41.101Z"}, {"movie_id": 299245, "review_id": "5dfa0bd560975000213273a0", "rating": 3.0, "review_text": "A near exact replica of that _Goosebumps_ episode \"Phantom of the Auditorium\" both in essential plot as well as video quality/acting calibre.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing.
