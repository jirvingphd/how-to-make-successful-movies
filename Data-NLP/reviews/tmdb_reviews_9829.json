Paul Greengrass masterfully captured the chaos and panic of September 11 as the military, government, FAA, and airlines all scrambled to respond to the terrorist crisis. The movie takes a few minutes before the frenzy is unleashed, but once it does, the tension and heart-pounding don\u2019t stop until the credits roll. This film is not a feel-good or heartwarming movie because it perfectly depicts the terror the passenger experienced and the power of their courage in such extraordinary circumstances. It\u2019s significant to see, understand, and experience that day through the perspectives of so many trying to protect the lives of those in danger.", "created_at": "2023-01-02T02:33:38.212Z"}]
