I have seen films about JFK, either based on the real or just fiction, but this one was entirely focused on his wife. It sets in just weeks after his assassination and soon goes back to that day and the following to tell us how Jacie Kennedy handled the bad time. From tragic event to conducting the final rites, that four days she has to fight for the right decisions. All these revealed by her to a reporter in one of the following week. Remember this film was originally meant for an HBO mini-series and then they turned it into a feature film. That was the risk taken by the filmmakers, later it paid off well.\r\n\r\nI never knew who was Jackie, so when I saw Portman's performance in the opening stage, I thought she was overdoing it, the accent and imitation. But after some progress in the story, I got used to it thinking that's how it would be. Yeah, she was excellent and she deserved that Oscars nomination. I wondered what was the source, but after the research I came to know that it was based on the magazine interview by the same reporter you would see in the film. The Chilean director's Hollywood debute. He has done a good job. Also one of the final films of John Hurt in which he was in a small role. Worth a watch for it is being unique and especially revealing some unknown truth behind and/or after death of JFK.\r\n\r\n_7/10_", "created_at": "2017-06-15T22:23:37.098Z"}]
