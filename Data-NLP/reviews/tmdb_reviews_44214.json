Natalie Portman is a revelation and the film is unpredictable but moves with an assurance to take you places you may not want to go. But you want to know how it all ends. Great film. I think most people won't appreciate it until a couple of years from now.", "created_at": "2019-10-15T21:46:54.541Z"}]
