Semi-disappointed with this film like it\u2019s just okay, I wasn\u2019t like wow, so great! Still entertaining though - I like the chemistry of the cast in the plane, the FAs were really funny and their interactions with the pilot! The passengers, didn\u2019t really care that much for them except the horny virgin one. ", "created_at": "2017-03-17T08:50:24.012Z"}]
