She plays a hit woman that has a bit of a guilty conscience for killing a boy's father.  She ends up taking the boy under her wing & giving him a better life. I wasn't sure what to think going into this movie, yet the storyline with the action made it enjoyable!", "created_at": "2018-03-27T03:06:02.464Z"}, {"movie_id": 442064, "review_id": "5b10dbaac3a36862150129e7", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Very different from advertised, _Proud Mary_ was not groundbreaking, but it appealed to me enough personally that I'd be interested in seeing Taraji P. Henson tackle the character again in the future. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2018-06-01T05:37:46.542Z"}]
