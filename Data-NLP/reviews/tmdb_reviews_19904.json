[{"movie_id": 19904, "review_id": "5da8b19db2681f00148de98c", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "***What if your stepfather is a psycho?***\r\n\r\nAfter an amiable man (Dylan Walsh) slays his family he starts a new one under a different identity in Portland, Oregon, but his discerning stepson (Penn Badgley) picks up on his dark side. Sela Ward plays the psycho\u2019s new fianc\u00e9 while Amber Heard is on hand as the stepson\u2019s girlfriend.\r\n\r\n\"The Stepfather\" (2009) is a solid crime drama/thriller with a bit o' slasher horror, a combination of the original film (1987) and its sequel (1989). All of the Stepfather flicks are loosely based on mass murderer John List. They contain elements of movies like \"Psycho\" (1960/1998) mixed with coming-of-age drama, like \u201cFright Night\u201d (1985) and \u201cDisturbia\u201d (2007). \r\n\r\nWalsh effectively portrays the delusional titular character while Badgley is competent as the teen protagonist. Meanwhile the director takes every opportunity to show Heard in a bikini or underwear, but she\u2019s way too thin to stir much interest despite her obvious attractiveness. She\u2019s more appealing after she acquired some curves, e.g. as Mera in \u201cAquaman\u201d (2018).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day this is an updated, slightly more compelling version of the first film and its sequel. There are just enough changes to make it worthwhile if you\u2019re familiar with the prior flicks. On the downside, it\u2019s a little predictable, but what else is new? \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles & Santa Clarita, California (with studio work done in Culver City).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+", "created_at": "2019-10-17T18:23:25.663Z"}]
