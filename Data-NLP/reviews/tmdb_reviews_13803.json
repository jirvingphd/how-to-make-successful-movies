With some genuinly creepy and well-crafted horror moments and really good cinematography. \r\n\r\nThe third 'shortfilm' however, was not very good. In fact I would probably say it was mostly crap. In that one Jessica Lucas takes the lead and she (as usual perhaps) doesn't really try to do much acting and instead focuses on looking pretty.\r\n\r\nThe second half where they all get tied in together, is really despite having it's moments with the solid cinematography continuing and some decent enough atmosphere is in the end very much a very messy ordeal with one plothole after the other and in the end doesn't make a whole lot of sense, if any.", "created_at": "2017-03-31T22:27:40.252Z"}]
