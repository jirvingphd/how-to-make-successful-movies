It's also entirely predictable, which doesn't help. A few of the characters from the first film are shoehorned in too, especially Nigel (Jemaine Clement).\r\n\r\nJesse Eisenberg (Blu) and Anne Hathaway (Jewel) reprise their roles, Eisenberg is the better of the two. Bruno Mars joins the cast, I actually liked his voice for Roberto but unfortunately his character is forgettable.\r\n\r\nI'd guess the younger viewers will like this, as well as a number of others. For me, it's just very average.", "created_at": "2020-09-03T22:11:13.107Z"}]
