Once again,  Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler pulled off a great comedy due to their awesome comedic  chemistry.  Mr.  Sandler uses some of the same jokes from previous movies of course but they didn't feel worn in this movie.  I actually enjoyed it.  Several hilarious moments throughout the movie.", "created_at": "2014-06-15T19:09:44.356Z"}, {"movie_id": 232672, "review_id": "55185a5d9251416f0d004ac3", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "The third time this pair had come together for a movie and it does not look good at all. The movie can be enjoyed for its comedy, not for anyone's performance. The location (South Africa) was good, but not exposed well, instead make fun out of it which was expected.\r\n\r\nIn earlier days I used laugh out loud for Sandler's jokes, he's not the same guy anymore, I barely smile now. And for Barrymore, she was one of my actresses (I believe still she's), but her recent movies are disappointing, or barely in entertainment business. Kind of attractive Bella Thorne in a tomboyish getup, hope to see her in many future projects.\r\n\r\nI heard that Dale Steyn does a cameo for a Hollywood and I did not know it was this movie until I saw him. He's a rock-star on the pitch, but when Sandler made fun out of him that irked me and then let it go as it just a silly movie. Like the old days' animation shorts for the TV, this film had collective pieces of comedic scenes. Individually very entertaining, but as a movie fails to assemble. Not for everyone, but manageable.\r\n\r\n6/10", "created_at": "2015-03-29T20:02:37.208Z"}]
