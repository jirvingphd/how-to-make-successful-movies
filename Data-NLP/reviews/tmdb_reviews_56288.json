Time travel is way too deep a concept to do properly in children's entertainment, but, that said, they did a decent job of dumbing it down so maybe some of the kids could grasp it.\r\n\r\nAgain, it weird to see big celebrities come in when I don't think kids would appreciate it, especially Jeremy Piven, who I know is hard to get signed onto a movie.\r\n\r\nAgain, they spent a lot of time on weird effects or yada-yadaing through a sequence instead of concentrating on a movie of substance.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly the deliveries were pretty good, and the script was alright, despite including time travel, but with all the time spent on the dog, and avoiding action or spending too little time building a scene, the movie evens out with there being less interesting things that good.\r\n\r\nI think kids will get into, and find a lot of the movie, especially that poor dog, hilarious.", "created_at": "2020-10-08T03:46:19.174Z"}]
