Apart from Louis de Fun\u00e8s comedies that is, I really love most of those.\r\n\r\nWell, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. I guess I should have checked a bit more. For instance the fact that the oxygen wasting \u201ccritics\u201d at Rotten SJW Tomatoes gave it a 100% rating should have been a red flag. Or maybe the ludicrous non-descriptive one liner description of the movie. I mean, it\u2019s like buying a car from a dealer that says \u201cIt\u2019s a cool car\u201d.\r\n\r\nWell, in my gaming days I was a great fan of submarine simulators, especially WW2 ones, so I guess I got suckered.\r\n\r\nFor starters, the premise of the movie itself, once you start watching that is, is nonsensical. One, I say ONE, missile is fired against French territory, it is assumed to be nuclear, no real evidence, and France decides to retaliate while said missile is still in flight. Seriously?\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s something that North Korea would do. Not a civilized country and despite the fact that France right now has the worst president in modern history I would still say France counts as a civilized country.\r\n\r\nThe the movie starts with some \u201caction\u201d and here we are immediately shown that the writer is totally clueless as far as any form of military procedures, strategy or \u2026 well.. whatever. A nuclear submarine surfaces, the captain, the CAPTAIN, goes up in the conning tower and fires a hand held SAM on a chopper sent from a destroyer nearby. Oh, by the way, he forgot to remove the safety on the first try. The destroyer does absolutely nothing during this exchange. You\u2019re fucking kidding me ???\r\n\r\nThen the movie spends a shitload of time with the hero moping and moaning and being unfairly treated by the hierarchy. The film got really boring at this point. The one good part is that the superior officers, at the end, is actually the most competent characters in the movie.\r\n\r\nWhen the action finally starts again it\u2019s \u2026 well the same crap as before. Utterly unbelievable and totally unrealistic. Even the dumbass president Macron would, hopefully, known that a nuclear strike cannot be called off just like that. And when it finally comes to blows, for some reason, the \u201cenemy\u201d submarine has all kinds of countermeasures while the \u201cgood guys\u201d never launches any. As I wrote before, the writer is clueless.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s just a incredibly bad movie.
