As a Sherlock Holmes movie\u2026not so much. Unfortunately, watching this movie confirms my suspicions. This is a Hollywood version of Sherlock Holmes. No style, no finesse. A Sherlock Holmes movie should not be a Hollywood action rollercoaster. It should be intelligent, stylish, witty perhaps involving detective work and, above all, British. It didn\u2019t help that they enrolled Stephen Frey. This film is just not right.\r\n\r\nI really cannot stand the hostility between Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. There no justification for it in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The slow motion scenes are nothing but annoying. The lame jokes are out of place in a Sherlock Holmes movie.\r\n\r\nIt gets a 5 out of 10 just because it\u2019s actually a decent movie\u2026if you can forget that they claim it to be a Sherlock Holmes one.", "created_at": "2018-05-12T15:00:31.362Z"}, {"movie_id": 58574, "review_id": "5f4b2b5eb2681f0032da50f2", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Probably the third time seeing this (once in theaters, another when it came out on Blu-ray) and still highly enjoyable, even think this is a tad better than the first if only because of Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty as a great adversary to Holmes. **3.75/5**", "created_at": "2020-08-30T04:30:22.274Z"}]
