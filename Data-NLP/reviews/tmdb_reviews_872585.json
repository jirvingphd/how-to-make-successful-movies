Nolan\u2019s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and na\u00efve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist\u2019s life, chronicles his development of \u201cthe gadget\u201d and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer\u2019s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture\u2019s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering\u2019s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.", "created_at": "2023-07-24T12:59:23.547Z"}, {"movie_id": 872585, "review_id": "64c0f3411cfe3a0eb42920a4", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the \"Manhattan Project\" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious \"Col. Groves\" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event \"enquiries\" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended.

Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it\u2019s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.\r\n\r\nThere has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that\u2019s a far cry from what I\u2019d call \u201centertaining.\u201d It\u2019s a great movie that\u2019s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn\u2019t really worth it.\r\n\r\nNolan\u2019s film is poignant in a way that\u2019s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that\u2019s plaguing society. There\u2019s a very real moral question about humanity\u2019s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan\u2019s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.\r\n\r\nNolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer\u2019s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover\u2019s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won\u2019t be completely lost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn\u2019t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it\u2019s refreshing to see a riveting movie that\u2019s made for thinking audiences.", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:04:22.910Z"}, {"movie_id": 872585, "review_id": "651ade4007216600e2d6ba8d", "rating": 9.0, "review_text": "The cinematic masterpiece that is Oppenheimer leaves an indelible impression on anyone who watches it.

Robert Oppenheimer and it is beautiful. I'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nanytime Christopher Nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little CGI as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single CGI shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding.\r\n\r\nwent into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of Oppenheimer. like most people, I only knew him as The Father of the Atomic Bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the Bhagavad Gita which are Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer of Worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. I had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of The Manhattan Project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by Ludwig G\u00f6ransson and watching all of these rated-R, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself Hoyte van Hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like I wasn't in 2023.\r\n\r\nthe performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. Robert Downey Jr. is simply terrific. I haven't seen him like this since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which came all the way back in 2005. I love him as Iron Man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. I wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. Emily Blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where Oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. Nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major A-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a Nolan-directed film but a testament to Nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence I mentioned earlier with Blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's Emily Blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, I can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is Cillian Murphy. in his first lead role for a Nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, Murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like Oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that I just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did I once see the guy from Red Eye or from Peaky Blinders. it was always Oppie.\r\n\r\nI'm actually putting this review as I listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. G\u00f6ransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that I could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable.\r\n\r\nanother aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of Oppenheimer. Nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and I really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life.\r\n\r\nthis film is truly a marvelous achievement not just for Christopher Nolan himself as a filmmaker but for cinema as a whole. peak dramatic cinema. watch this on the biggest screen possible and the loudest speakers you can find.", "created_at": "2023-10-16T09:16:57.596Z"}, {"movie_id": 872585, "review_id": "654f66ec67b61300afcada63", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "excellent, a perfect example of true defined cinema\r\nAt a whopping three hours long it, very much like LOTR, feels considerably less.\r\nA must watch", "created_at": "2023-11-11T11:35:08.213Z"}, {"movie_id": 872585, "review_id": "6553dc1cd4fe04011b90af5f", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Well, with ten other reviews on this site, I am not going to give a blow-by-blow assessment of what I like or don\u2019t like.

I surely recommend doing some research before and after watching the film to better understand it. I also recommend researching about the simple facts of the Manhattan Project, who the people involved in the Manhattan Project are, and who Oppenheimer is before and after watching the movie.\r\n\r\n**WATCH IT ON THE BIGGEST IMAX SCREEN YOU CAN FIND, especially if you are interested in science, the true story of the Manhattan Project, and course, other Chris Nolan films. This movie was filmed specially for IMAX screening, Nolan and his crew used IMAX 70mm film and cameras, and they also invented the B&W 65mm film specially for this movie.**\r\n\r\nI have watched every single Chris Nolan\u2019s films ever since I was a kid. His movies have been a big part of my life and his movies are the things that helped me go through tough times and give me a new dream. Oppenheimer was just staggering. It was amazing, I do not have the words to describe my feelings watching that movie, especially seeing how much improvements Cillian, Nolan and other actors have gotten through over the years, and I was so glad that Cillian is finally getting the attention he deserves too. The cinematography, the storyline, the dialogues, the characters, the music, the camera angles, position, lighting, editing, the script, and everything else were just amazing. I have read every single line of the transcript and I have already rewatched the movie 5 times to better understand it. I also am reading the American Prometheus which is amazing. After my first time watching Oppenheimer, the thoughts and questions I had after watching it stayed with me for weeks, which led me to watch it again and again. I was amazed, it was breathtaking. The cinematography was beautiful and it couldn\u2019t have been better. The fact that Nolan didn\u2019t use CGI for the Trinity test scene and Oppenheimer's visions of the quantum world just made me more inspired. Five stars are not enough for this movie, neither are any stars and ratings in this world. This movie is out of this world and it is a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe costumes in this movie were simply amazing. The costumes were very well designed, and the colours were also amazing. It also played a huge part in the movie and helped Nolan out a lot by just contributing to making his visuals and imagination come to life. \r\n\r\nThe sound effect was unbelievable. The sound effects + Cinematography and Visual Effects made me feel like I was in the room with all the characters when all the events occurred. The Trinity test scene was also amazing, I loved how Nolan expressed the nervousness of the scientists before and after pressing the button. \r\nI also absolutely loved the soundtrack of this film. Ludwig Goransson used a variety of instruments and tempos to convey the mood of the scene and the emotions of a character. The soundtrack enhances the film scenes and makes the whole film much more interesting to watch. Nothing in this world, no headphones, earphones, and speakers can be used to replicate my feelings listening to these soundtracks in an IMAX theatre.\r\nThe casting was amazing too. The actors were excellent in portraying the difficult emotions of their characters. Cillian Murphy was amazing at representing the emotion Oppenheimer felt during his hardships over the years. The supporting actors and actresses were also amazing at playing the supporting parts in this movie and acting out how their characters had an impact on Oppenheimer's life. \r\n\r\nIf you have already watched the film and found it very fun and interesting, and if you want to learn more about how the film was made, I highly recommend you watch videos online regarding Christopher Nolan's method of making this film. I also recommend you watch interviews and the bts of this film as you may learn more amazing things about the movie and Nolan's way of filmmaking. If you want to learn more about the Manhattan Project and especially Oppenheimer's life, I highly recommend you read The American Prometheus as it is the book that Chris Nolan took the inspiration and information for this film. Although it is quite long, it is worth it. I also recommend you read the transcript of this film if you have time, as you can understand the dialogues and words better and check the parts and details you may have missed in the movie. The script is written in first person POV: Oppenheimer's viewpoint, which makes it more interesting to read, and it makes you feel like you are in the same room as the characters, even without visual effects.\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the fact that Christopher Nolan did not use CGI for this movie. Almost everything was practical and CGI was only used to enhance the look. Nolan has already amazed the cinema society with his simply staggering practical effects that were huge and well-planned. Nolan used all sorts of creative ways to recreate the iconic Trinity Test scene and the unique visions of Oppenheimer. By watching the bts of Oppenheimer, you can see how determined Nolan is to bring a masterpiece to the table.\r\n \r\nSome people may find this movie boring. If you hate movies based on history, have zero interest in science, or hate movies that require a bit of thinking and researching before and after, then probably this movie may not be for you and you might find the movie extremely _boring._ Of course, you should understand that everyone has different opinions and views about almost anything in this world so there is always a possibility that you may disagree with the things I have said here.\r\n**Overall, this movie is a masterpiece**. As a fan of Noaln's films and Cillian Murphy's acting ever since childhood, this film couldn't have been better. I definitely recommend you see this, as soon as possible, and on the biggest IMAX screen possible because it would be worth it. Of course, if you dislike the kinds of films I mentioned in the previous paragraphs, I don't recommend you see this film. I want to thank the crew who have worked very hard on this project, I want to thank the actors who just showed a staggering performance, I want to thank Ludwig Goransson for his amazing soundtracks in this film, and of course, I want to thank Christopher Nolan for his dedication and his amazing film, I would like to call **his masterpiece**.", "created_at": "2023-12-29T14:13:26.952Z"}, {"movie_id": 872585, "review_id": "6596adedea37e006fa4cc1fd", "rating": null, "review_text": "Well, was a interesting movie.
