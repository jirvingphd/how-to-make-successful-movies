The entire gaslighting adversity of having thought he's trying to get back to his sister reminds me of \"Joe Dirt\" and \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\", which are both probably funnier.\r\n\r\nThe mob mix is an interesting ingredient, but it might have been a bit of a hat on a hat.\r\n\r\nUltimately, you're getting a funny experience, but it is quite a bit of a rollercoaster.", "created_at": "2021-03-10T16:51:38.072Z"}]
