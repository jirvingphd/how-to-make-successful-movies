Every time there was an opportunity for us to actually get to know the characters, or to get an inkling as to why they were bonding so well, we were diverted to a song and some extended GVs of the city. As such, their whirlwind romance didn't resonate and the surfeit of coincidences left me expecting an imminent lottery jackpot. If they really did spend $9m on this, then it wasn't on the script which is pretty pedestrian. It isn't a bad film - but it is instantly forgettable.", "created_at": "2022-03-27T12:12:59.144Z"}]
