Her brother, who has sworn off climbing because of his father's climbing death, has no choice but to assemble a team to rescue the trio.\r\n\r\nWHAT WORKS: As already mentioned, the opening sequence is excellent, the locations are great (the New Zealand Alps), the story pretty much keeps your attention (until the absurdities really mount up -- pun intended) and both Robin Tunney & Izabella Scorupco are deliciously beautiful.\r\n\r\nWHAT DOESN'T WORK: As the story continues the believability decreases severely. In fact, the crisis/suspense/action sequences are so EXTREME and strung so close together (especially as the movie proceeds) they tend to make you bust out laughing -- the very OPPOSITE reaction the creators wanted. By the very end the ridiculous overkill made me lose interest in whatever story was supposed to be there.\r\n\r\nFINAL ANALYSIS: I was hoping for something unexpectedly great like \"The Edge,\" but ended up with a fun but ultimately shallow time-waster. For comparison, \"Cliffhanger\" is \"Apocalypse Now\" next to \"Vertical Limit.\"\r\n\r\nGRADE: C", "created_at": "2021-03-29T08:18:30.767Z"}]
