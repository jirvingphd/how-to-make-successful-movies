Reilly, this is a humorous take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic mysteries featuring Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. In this film they have four days to solve a case or else the Queen will become the next victim.\r\n\r\nThis has some laugh out loud moments, some scenes that will make you snort, and regular lulls in the story. \r\n\r\nIf you go into this expecting laughs like <i>Blades of Glory</i>, <i>Anchorman</i>, or <i>Step Brothers</i> then you will come away disappointed. But if you set your expectations right and go in looking for low brow humour and dick jokes strung together by a very basic storyline, you might just have yourself a good time.", "created_at": "2019-10-12T00:06:31.323Z"}]
