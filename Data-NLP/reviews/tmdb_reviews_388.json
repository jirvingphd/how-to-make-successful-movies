Spike Lee and Denzel Washington keep the drama going and although quite few, the twists do keep you guessing. Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer appear sparingly, but they contribute quite substantially to the rather more evil and interesting sub-plot. This movie touches upon social and religious mores a little, though I wouldn't say this was Lee at his most political - and this all adds to an enjoyable multi-layered story. A good watch.\r\n\r\nNo likes yet", "created_at": "2022-03-27T18:43:55.062Z"}, {"movie_id": 388, "review_id": "6324d4ce1749730091759f54", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "**Inside Man is the most clever and interesting bank robbery film I have ever seen!**\r\n\r\nInside Man is mind-blowing, clever, fast-paced, well-crafted, and downright brilliant. With an all-star cast led by Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, Inside Man takes twists and turns you never see coming. Denzel\u2019s clever charm combats Clive\u2019s steely calm intensity leaving the audience intrigued and engaged, wondering what is happening from start to finish. The genius writing makes the crazy robbery scheme seem believable and actually possible. Inside Man makes you root for both sides of the law wanting the burglars to succeed and the cops to get their man with a highly satisfying and rewarding resolution. My only complaints would be the final 20 minutes falters in pacing a little as it attempts to tie all the threads together, and all the foul language was unnecessary. All in all, Inside Man is a brilliant must-see for any heist film enthusiast, Denzel Washington fan, or movie lover in general.", "created_at": "2022-09-16T19:55:58.179Z"}]
