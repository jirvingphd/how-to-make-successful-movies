They are the film's major plus. I'm struggling for other positives, cinematography at a push?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I came away from watching feeling underwhelmed. The second half really drags, not helped by an extremely lame 'twist'. The first half isn't perfect but does hold potential, once the main bunch eventually team up it's more interesting. The editing is a little iffy, too.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few talky scenes that aren't worthwhile at all, especially early on with Chastain and Sebastian Stan. Things improve when the action sequences get underway, not that they are anything extraordinary but what we see is satisfactory; it's the bits in between that let this 2022 release down.\r\n\r\n6/10, despite the well performing cast; who almost made me give this 7/10.", "created_at": "2022-01-18T12:50:23.012Z"}, {"movie_id": 522016, "review_id": "6212c4898138310042d39975", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Pretty lifeless global action-thriller where it seemed co-writer and director Simon Kinberg was attempting to emulate the Bourne franchise (the cinematography and score especially reminded me of that series). \r\n\r\nThe story is thin, predictable and really sounded familiar but can't put my finger on what (thinking Casino Royale with the short selling of stocks at least), but a thin story is fine (a few of the Mission Impossible movies didn't have the strongest plots or villains), if only the main cast had any chemistry which I didn't feel they did, despite a few of them being solid actresses.\r\n\r\nThis yet another film that filmmakers thought would be a potential franchise as it's left open ended for a sequel.

However, the generic screenplay, poor dialogues, and barely developed characters turn a film with much potential into another disappointment from Simon Kinberg (The New Mutants).\r\n\r\nThe action sequences actually include interesting choreography, but the use of quick cuts and shaky cam doesn't always work favorably. The narrative is loaded with the usual formulas of the respective genre, and some attempts to approach the theme of feminism efficiently fall flat.\r\n\r\nPersonally, it's saved by the fact that it was primarily filmed in real locations, helping with the entertainment levels.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C", "created_at": "2022-03-30T15:40:19.625Z"}, {"movie_id": 522016, "review_id": "625345eeb6c2644e86c5a932", "rating": null, "review_text": "An all women movie, I might just love it.

Yeah, content here is mostly replaced by contempt.\r\n\r\nThese women are charismatic and attractive (except BingBing who's just a pain for my sorry eyes and ears) and need to stick together .. how intriguing (stick what ? not sure yet).

The cast was stellar, and the performances were solid. Unfortunately, the 355 stumbles with a stale, unimaginative script that is incredibly predictable and keeps the peril and danger from feeling very perilous or dangerous. I didn\u2019t finish the movie feeling I had wasted my time, but I couldn\u2019t say I would recommend it. Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, and the rest of the cast seemed to have fun working on this project together, and their chemistry was entertaining. Still, the trite dialogue kept all of it from being great. I wish The 355 had been trusted with a bigger budget and a more experienced director.
