The story is comical and silly for the most part, but gets serious here and there and ends up holding a positive message.\r\n\r\nThe cast list is absolutely stacked, there are many familiar names. Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Jason Segel, Kristen Wiig, Ken Jeong to name just some. Pretty impressive. Heck, even Don's buddy Stormy Daniels is in there.\r\n\r\nIt made me laugh in a few moments, nothing belly laugh worthy but I had fun with bits of it for sure. Rogen and Heigl are extremely solid together, the latter particularly does well. I will say the run time is a little too long, these type of comedy films tend to work best at 90mins in my opinion.", "created_at": "2021-02-26T23:53:11.957Z"}]
