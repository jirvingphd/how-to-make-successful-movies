The other protagonists are played by Brittany Daniel, Donald Faison, Crystal Reed and David Zayas.\r\n\r\n\"Skyline\" (2010) combines elements of other Alien invasion flicks like \u201cIndependence Day\u201d (1996), \u201cBattle: Los Angeles\u201d (2011), \u201cCloverfield\u201d (2008) and \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d (1953/2005) with an ending reminiscent of the same in \u201cNight Skies\u201d (2007). The people-snatching aspect recalls \u201cThe Forgotten\u201d (2004).   \r\n\r\nThe director brothers are visual effects designers who were working on the blockbuster \u201cBattle: Los Angeles\u201d while making this indie, which only cost about $10 million. Sony Pictures sued, but the case was later dropped. It must\u2019ve scared the directors because they haven\u2019t returned to directing since (as of this writing) even though \u201cSkyline\u201d made $21 million domestically and $78 million worldwide, which led to the sequel \u201cBeyond Skyline\u201d (2017) by other filmmakers.\r\n\r\nBeing made by effects experts, it\u2019s not surprising that the F/X in \u201cSkyline\u201d are top-of-the-line. Some of the aliens or crafts look like they were modeled after sea creatures, like octopi and jelly fish. There are also probing tentacles, as seen in \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201d Meanwhile the main vessels and some of the aliens are similar to those in \u201cIndependence Day.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s not enough human interest and the story is too one-dimensional to be overly gripping, for me anyway. Still, this is a grave, tense account of what a malevolent alien invasion might be like. It lacks the lighter side of \u201cIndependence Day\u201d and other eye-rolling aspects (e.g. the pro-American angle), but \u201cID\u201d had more human interest and a plot with a much larger scope. This one amounts to: Aliens attack earth and snatch victims, the end. Yet it\u2019s well done for what it is. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles with shots of New York City, London and Hong Kong at the end.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "created_at": "2019-05-05T05:17:38.508Z"}, {"movie_id": 42684, "review_id": "649e59c9c072a2014faf76f9", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "The story does unfold slowly, but it was far from boring (in my opinion).\r\nI'm not sure why they started off with backstory and explaining why the two main characters were at the apartment block. It didn't help the story.\r\n\r\nI thought the story was well presented and from a Sci-Fi perspective was plausible.\r\nThe production values were very high with excellent special effects. The feel of the movie was very real and you felt what the characters would be feeling... so I guess this means the acting was believable.\r\n\r\nAt no time did I need to suspend my disbelief.\r\nTo me, that is the mark of a good Sci-Fi movie.", "created_at": "2023-06-30T04:27:53.554Z"}]
