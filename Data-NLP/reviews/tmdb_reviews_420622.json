It doesn't exploit those avenues as well as it perhaps could have, and feels underdeveloped in a great many of its aspects, but still as both biopic and character drama, Wonder Women is a success.\r\n\r\nThere are better movies than _Professor Marston and the Wonder Women_ out there for a person to watch, but its hard to imagine there being one more timely.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._", "created_at": "2018-03-09T10:35:16.545Z"}]
