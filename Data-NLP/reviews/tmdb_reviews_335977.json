INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF THE LOST DIALS SKULL \u2013 DAY\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is more closely related to its recent sequel than its distant cousins of the original trilogy. It attempts to take the franchise's formula and shake it up; it throws in cameos, call-backs and references but suffers the same issue every recent Lucasfilm movie has. \r\n\r\nIt's another modern Disney reboot sequel with legacy characters left in the dirt, and a 'quirky & quippy' new character is presented to us. You know this character type when in the face of fear, they will make fun of the villain's Lactose Intolerance or something random because this character is flawlessly confident. They are knowledgeable on every subject relevant to the plot, smartasses because they are always correct, sassy when held hostage and always have an escape plan. This is Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridges), and she might be the only consistent character in the film. For the rest of the ensemble, Boyd Holbrooks Klaber speaks once in the movie and then chases after Jones in each scene; Mads Mikkelsens J\u00fcrgen Voller is the most forgettable antagonist of the franchise, Antonio Banderas is out of the film faster than he's in it and finally, Harrison Ford as Dr Jones is unfortunately back for what seems like a pretty good paycheck.\r\n\r\nI have nothing against the performances themselves. The cast is incredibly talented, but this skilled team cannot hide the terrible dialogue reinforcing the rather forgettable story. Ultimately, Indiana Jones has one of the greatest trilogies of films with a distance spin-off universe of sequels.

The film is the first in the series since Disney acquired Lucasfilm and the first not to benefit from involvement by Gorge Lucas or the direction of Steven Spielberg. James Mangold has taken on directing duties and faces the challenge of delivering a satisfying solution to the series and one that atones for the disappointing \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\".\r\nThe film opens in the waning days of World War II when the imminent defeat of the Nazis has caused a mass exodus of their plundered archaeological treasures which draws Jones into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe digital de-aging technology is impressive as we get an extended sequence of the younger Jones and his colleague Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), in a frantic and at times humorous segment that evokes memories of some of the finer moments from the series.\r\nFlash forward to 1969 as the world prepares to celebrate the return of the lunar astronauts, Jones is dealing with the pending retirement from teaching as well as issues in his personal life.\r\nWhen a figure from his past named Helena (Phoene Waller-Bridge) who happens to be his Goddaughter evokes memories of a disagreement with her father several years earlier over the fabled Dial of Destiny which Indiana and her father were able to retrieve half of earlier in the film.\r\n\r\nAt the same time former Nazi scientists Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), who is receiving his kudos as a key part of sending men to the moon and back, plots to obtain both parts of the Dial and with his legion of deadly assassins in tow, sets his sights on Jones and Shaw.\r\n\r\nThings become even more complicated when Jones is framed for murder and forced to flee in pursuit of Shaw sees archaeological discoveries as nothing more than a financial gain versus their historical significance.\r\nFrom New York to Tangiers, Greece, and other locales, Jones, Shaw, and her sidekick Teddy (Ethan Isidore), this battle against each other as well as the menace that constant Voller presents as they attempt to decipher the clues to combine the Dial and keep it from those who use it evil.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it is interspersed throughout the film and while not the FX-laden visual abundance that modern audiences have come to expect, they are generally satisfying and factor in that the title character is a senior citizen pushing 80 and as such does some remarkably impressive action when called upon even though he does in one scene to lying about his various injuries and trials that he has faced over the years and the toll they take it upon his body.\r\n\r\nSome fans may say there was not enough action for the hook was not as compelling as in previous adventures. While this is certainly a valid thought process the film should delight true fans of the series as it is an appropriate look at the aging adventurer as he is pulled back into the field once again.\u00a0 There is also the matter of the new music from John Williams which sets the tone for the film well.\r\n\r\nFord and Waller-Bridge work well with one another and there are some surprise guests that appear along the way one should delight fans. I found the movie to be more satisfying than the last two films in that the focus was on the character and themes of life, loss, aging, and doing what was right versus an abundance of action around a treasure hunt.\r\n\r\nIt will be different things to different people but for me, \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" is a loving send-off to the beloved character and one that cements the iconic Jones as a true cinematic classic.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5", "created_at": "2023-06-16T14:44:07.897Z"}, {"movie_id": 335977, "review_id": "64a22416c390c500aeb1be5b", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "It seems these days that it\u2019s become all too easy to blast popular, commercial fare simply because it is popular, commercial fare.

However, Indiana Jones has once again given us a rollicking good time with a captivating narrative, an intriguing assortment of twists and turns, and an array of colorful characters all vying for their piece of the pie (if not the entire pie itself). The film also provides fans of the franchise with deftly handled touches at achieving closure for the series, without dangling obvious or ambiguous carrots of there being more to come or any kind of impending reboot. Director James Mangold successfully puts the series to bed and tucks it in nicely while rounding off any remaining edges, something that it and its fans deserve.

We are introduced to the antiquity and lore that is the basis for this adventure. This start was a little jarring at first, but I was soon enthralled by the action and comedy.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Toby Jones' brief appearance at the beginning, but the villain played by Mads Mikkelsen was severely underutilised. The runtime was a little long, with the middle feeling rather lethargic. I would have preferred a little more low-key adventuring, similar to the exploration of Archimedes's tomb, than the bigger action sequences.\r\n\r\nThere was a definite nostalgia kick to the entire movie. There was a new young sidekick and old familiar faces. There was the trademark adventure, creepy crawlies and historical riddles. There were Nazis, car chases and fight scenes. There was some fun deadpan comedy. The iconic travel map made an appearance \u2013 with a couple in front pointing at the screen in excitement when it appeared. But it was hearing the score throughout that was the biggest endorphin kick.

Thank you Doomcock, without your intervention this movie would have been even worse.  It shows, the plot is messy, the re-shoots are a little obvious story-wise as Disney did their best to attempt to avoid the fan backlash promised for when their plans were to kill Indy off and have Phoebe replace him....\r\n\r\n... and then when when they re-shoot it again because the fans didn't want to see Indiana Jones be ridiculed constantly by his female replacement in an effort to make the KK stand-in come across as better in every way... and a lot of that is still there in the final product.\r\n\r\nLike Star Wars did to Skywalker, Indiana Jones is constantly shamed by the younger more diverse version... who can't seem to decide what character she wants to be.  Rogue?  Scholar?  Conman? Her personality changes as the script dictates, but Indiana remains pathetic... so that Strong Female Lead can look better.\r\n\r\nIn the end it's a mess, and the result is that Disney killed another fan favorite Franchise.

Luckily - for the colonel, that is - renowned archeologist \"Voller\" (Mads Mikkelsen) is on hand to advise that it's a fake - but by way of compensation, he informs the man that there is a far greater artefact on board their train. The \"Dial of Destiny\" - designed of old by Archimedes and reputed to have the ability to facilitate time travel. Our eponymous and intrepid adventurer is also on the train, with his scholarly pal \"Basil\" (Toby Jones) and together they manage to secure this gadget and flee - only to find that it is but half of the device.

Aside from the fact that the star is still very much a star, and his charisma does lots to keep this going; the film is itself a really rather unremarkable, procedural, adventure story that includes all the staple ingredients of the first three films but without the depth of the supporting characters. Mikkelsen doesn't really cut it as a baddie any more and Waller-Bridge is largely out of her depth and relies rather heavily on her teenage sidekick \"Teddy\" (Ethann Isidore) to be the foil for her rather obvious witticisms and slightly unscrupulous behaviour. It doesn't hang about and the visual effects are pretty standard but the writing is really quite pedestrian and the ending seemed borne more of a need to finish the film rather than complete the really pretty thin story that really does tee up a sequel!

Excessively dull and far too long, director James Mangold\u2018s movie burns every last drop of goodwill that\u2019s left in the tank. This fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones saga is a pathetic sendoff to one of the most iconic big screen characters of all time.\r\n\r\nSet in 1969, Daredevil archaeologist Henry \u201cIndiana\u201d Jones (Harrison Ford) is still working as a professor, but today is his retirement day. In his final class, a young woman from his past turns up: his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She\u2019s in search of a mystical device that her father Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) obsessed over until the day he died, and Indy knows its historical significance all too well. It\u2019s been said that the Antikythera (the Greek name for the Dial of Destiny), can alter the course of history and time, and it would turn any person who held it into a god. Soon Indy and Helena find out that former Nazi and current NASA scientist J\u00fcrgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) also wants the device for himself so he can change the outcome of World War II, and it becomes a race against time (and a very dangerous enemy) if they want to save history as the world knows it.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a bad story overall, but it certainly is a mess of one. It\u2019s extremely slow, and the most interesting parts happen in the film\u2019s final 45 minutes. That means there\u2019s an abundance of bland filler and tepid action chase scenes that fill screen time before all the good stuff happens. There\u2019s a lot of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at play here, as Mangold tries to milk fond memories of the earlier (and best) \u201cRaiders\u201d films, and he\u2019s not shy about masking his intentions. The film brings back classic characters like Marion (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who only briefly appear as a means of tugging on the heartstrings (and reminding audiences of far, far better movies).\r\n\r\nThere are so many missteps in this film that it becomes more of a bore than a fun means of escapism. The opening sequence is a little fun, but it\u2019s too reminiscent of the circus train intro in \u201cLast Crusade.\u201d There\u2019s another tuk tuk chase that\u2019s eerily familiar to the mine cars in \u201cTemple of Doom.\u201d The script (which credits four writers) inserts plenty of winks and nudges as it references the most classic Indiana Jones films. While the crack of Indy\u2019s whip and the moment he dons his famous brown fedora may get those feel-good endorphins flowing, it also makes in painfully clear that a movie can only coast so far on nostalgia.\r\n\r\nA large chunk of the problem is (surprisingly) with the character. An archaeologist outsmarting Nazi villains feels more dated in today\u2019s society than it should, even though the film is set in the late \u201960s. Indiana Jones will always be a classic of course, and the studio should be applauded for its decision not to recast Ford in what is in the top two of his most iconic roles. What\u2019s cringey is the use of de-aging software for the scenes that take place in the past, which makes Ford look plastic, fake, and straight out of a Pixar movie. It doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s distracting, and it arguably was unnecessary within the confines of the story the film is trying to tell.\r\n\r\nOne of the positives is that Ford is clearly still a movie star, and he holds the movie together with what appears to be minimal effort. Yes, it\u2019s easy to tell when a stunt person is standing in and it\u2019s obvious through some clever (and choppy) editing that Ford wasn\u2019t personally able to perform all of the physicality the role demanded, but he still lives and breathes Indiana Jones, so much so that after a little bit of time, you don\u2019t even see him as an old man. The addition of Waller-Bridge adds a refreshing spark to the film, and her character and performance are quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d will perform well across generations, but Gen Xers and older audiences will be delighted to see one of their favorite characters back in his own action / adventure story. What a pity this is the best sendoff that could be mustered for Indy after all this time.", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:01:49.582Z"}, {"movie_id": 335977, "review_id": "64f236cf9408ec0100bc548b", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "\"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" delivers exactly what fans of the iconic adventurer have been yearning for\u2014a thrilling, action-packed adventure that pays homage to the franchise's rich history while introducing new and captivating elements.\r\n\r\nHarrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones with the same charm and charisma that has made him a beloved cinematic icon for decades.
