But still it does justice for watching it once. Too random sequences of present and past, though the point was proven. It's nothing, but a simple romance drama. Most close to the real world relationship. You would still feel the cinematic effect, yet if you encounter a scene that happened in your life and around you, that won't be a surprise. Because a relationship has to go through such phases.\r\n\r\nI felt like the dialogues should have been much better, because I can't point out it was whether editing issue or the dialogues. At the end, I realised it was the character Peter, designed in that way. Yep, he seems an average, particularly his skills against women, are poor. So I felt bad for Vandy to get trapped with such person. But love can strike anywhere to/with anyone, right! This is a decent film if you like to take a chance, because it is not your regular romance-drama.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_", "created_at": "2018-02-04T14:00:42.269Z"}]
