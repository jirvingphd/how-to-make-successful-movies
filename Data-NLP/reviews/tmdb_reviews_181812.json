Firstly: I'm NOT a big Star Wars fan. I like the movies and see them as a \"good\" franchise, but I wouldn't put any of them on my personal top lists.\r\n\r\nI enjoy the art of the franchise way more than the story. I LOVE the music, the design of ships and the visual world building. I like some aspects of the overall story more than others of course, but none really come to mind when I think of what I like about the movies in general.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I felt \"The Force Awakens\" was really boring. Just a generic movie trying to do \"the Star Wars things\". It was fine but not in any way memorable to me.\r\n\r\n\"The Last Jedi\" on the other hand really tried ignoring the big \"Star Wars cult\" and therefore entertained me the most of all the 9 movies. I prefered the focus on using the \"Star Wars\" world to tell a story rather then to tell another \"Star Wars\"-version.\r\n\r\n\"The Rise of Skywalker\" now is at best as boring as \"The Force Awakens\" and very often a big punch in the face to everything I liked about \"The Last Jedi\". Obviously the higher ups at Disney decided to take notes on everything \"the fans\" disliked about the 8th movie and do some sort of \"damage control\" according to that feedback.\r\n\r\nThe movie hast way too much going on for reasons which are often non-existant or just plainly bad. Since the movie couldn't grab my focus I just happened to think more about the big plotholes and started nitpicking and sometimes even mocking the movie for certain decisions which I don't want to spoil here.\r\n\r\nIt's really a shame. I hope Disney will use the name in the future to do standalone movies of different genres, for example a racing movie in space would be great or a good action flick with one or two of the beloved characters.\r\n\r\nIf I had to give it a rating I would probably give the movie a 4-6/10. I only REALLY enjoyed one scene because I hoped for it to happen most of the movie, but that didn't save the rest.", "created_at": "2019-12-19T18:26:50.008Z"}, {"movie_id": 181812, "review_id": "5dfc767326dac100175d49c7", "rating": 9.0, "review_text": "Went to the first showing in town tonight.  I really enjoyed the film.  Although it leaned heavy on nostalgia, it should, since it is wrapping up 40 years.  I did not care for The Last Jedi, and was worried going in.  Will do a deeper dive after I have seen it a few times.", "created_at": "2019-12-20T07:21:23.162Z"}, {"movie_id": 181812, "review_id": "5dfcb04f65686e001390cd34", "rating": 3.0, "review_text": "It\u2019s hard to write a review for this film without any major spoilers, so this might seem a little vague here and there. There will be very minor spoilers, primarily what\u2019s revealed in the opening text crawl or the trailers, so not much, but if you want to go into this film completely virgin, stop here.\r\n\r\nThe film starts off with things already underway. A transmission has been sent out that contains the voice of Emperor Palpatine. Kylo Ren, now Supreme Leader of the First Order, goes to seek out Palpatine as a potential threat to his power. In the meantime, the Resistance is still in shambles after the events of \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d and they are busy doing scouting missions and regrouping.\r\n\r\nAll of this is revealed in the opening crawl of the movie, which is where the problems begin. It violates a cardinal rule of storytelling: Show, don\u2019t tell. It wouldn\u2019t have taken much to have this done on screen in more dramatic and effective fashion. Instead, this has the effect of making it feel like we either missed something important or that we\u2019re watching an entirely different movie with a different story. This makes things confusing. It doesn\u2019t help that I was already thinking that J.J. Abrams probably needs to go back to Screenwriting 101 during the opening crawl. Not a good way to start.\r\n\r\nOther things happen during the course of the movie that make no sense. Why does Kylo Ren reforge his helmet? We never really find that out. He just does. The Knights of Ren do appear in this film finally. Who are they? If you\u2019re expecting an answer of any kind, you\u2019ll be disappointed. Why is there this strange connection between Rey and Kylo Ren? One of the mysteries of the Force, I suppose. Characters who we don\u2019t know appear from nowhere having been significant to the goings on even though we\u2019ve never seen them before. Other characters take bizarre and up to now not even hints at character arcs. It becomes a horrendously confusing mess.\r\n\r\nI liked some of the more controversial aspects of \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d Rey being a nobody with no significant parentage? Great idea! The galaxy is a big place. Why does everyone have to be related? Well, this is adjusted slightly. I won\u2019t go into details, but it was disappointing what they did, in my opinion. Leia\u2019s story arc in this film is...weird. I\u2019m going to allow that it\u2019s due to the loss of Carrie Fisher and having to use archival footage (one scene that shows a young Luke and Leia using computer effects is freaky at best). But it\u2019s off-putting and feels tacked on for convenience. It was nice to see Lando return, although even that felt more like throwing a bone to the fans. He could have potentially been replaced by any character with flying skills. Speaking of such, Wedge does make finally make an appearance, but it\u2019s a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it moment.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how I would sum it up spoiler-free: As I said, I liked \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d a lot, including parts that many didn\u2019t like or found weird as I stated above, but at the same time it was not a problem-free movie for me. \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d is the exact opposite. It definitely has some really cool moments, but feels so sloppy and makes so many storytelling mistakes that, on the whole, I have to say that it\u2019s a bad movie. I\u2019ve said this about just about everything I\u2019ve seen come from J.J. Abrams, that he\u2019s great at coming up with interesting imagery. He gets these pictures in his head of something that would be really interesting to see on film, like flashes one might remember from a dream. For example, there\u2019s a great scene near the end that finally corrects what many consider a great injustice done in an earlier movie. But couching these images in a cohesive story is not his strong suit. In fact, he\u2019s downright terrible at it. This problem seemed to be going in full force in \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker.\u201d\r\n\r\nWere some of my complaints addressed in some expanded material? I don\u2019t know, but even if they were it would still make it bad storytelling. Star Wars has always been fairly good about keeping things self-contained. Expanded material adds extra background to enhance the enjoyment of the main material, like adding seasoning, but shouldn\u2019t be necessary to appreciate the meal.\r\n\r\nOverall, you need to see this movie to close out the Skywalker Saga, but that\u2019s really the only reason. Don\u2019t go into this expecting a good or even decent film, or for every question to be answered. Ultimately, it\u2019s a disappointing end to Star Wars, and I say this as a Star Wars fan.", "created_at": "2019-12-20T11:28:15.974Z"}, {"movie_id": 181812, "review_id": "5dfed8b465686e0013949278", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "When The Force Awakens was released the vast majority of fans liked it. They were practically watching a remake of A New Hope but it was enough for them. Although they never liked Rey. That damn feminist agenda right?\r\n\r\nThe Last Jedi took that from them, it got away from the formula and they went crazy.\r\nWho was that Rian Johnson and how he dare to change the characters that only they know how they should act?\r\n\r\nThey did not give them what they wanted and that annoyed them and it's ironic because many times they have complained about the saga and its direction and if something has become clear to me it's that the great majority only want the same, like in the original trilogy. And what does that mean? Fan service. And that's what Star Wars has become.\r\n\r\nYou don't believe me? Ask fans about the scene they liked the most about Rogue One.\r\nVader's scene. A fan service scene. \r\n\r\nAnd the fear of losing the ''fans'' forced Disney to undo what they were creating, they also threw Johnson and his film under the bus and they practically announced this new film like the one that came to fix the disaster. A shame and an insult to the director's work.\r\n\r\nRise of Skywalker in my opinion represents a setback and it doesn't matter that this is supposed to be the ending. It's a setback because they decided to play it safe and submit to the whims of the audience.\r\nWhile that does not translate into poor quality, it doesn't represent something worth mentioning either. \r\n\r\nStar Wars represents pure and good entertainment but when it lacks surprises and feels so safe and predictable it means that you're sacrificing any emotional resonance and when it comes to the end of the 9 episodes, that emotion is simply not there.\r\nThat shot of Rey looking at the two suns should have felt overwhelming and thrilling and I don't know about you but I didn't feel it and that was a huge letdown. \r\n\r\nAnd that's what separates this ending from Return of The Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, even though it was known what would happen in Episode III, despite the mistakes there was emotion, here was like finishing the business. \r\n\r\nI don't consider myself a die-hard fanatic of Star Wars but I do like the saga a lot, yet in order to survive, even of its toxic fandom, they have to dare to try new stuff and forget about the original trilogy because to live in the past is to die in the present and for the saga to have a future, looking forward is the only way. \r\n\r\nIt's a very well made and entertaining film and it was a decent ending for this trilogy but quite an underwhelming conclusion for the saga as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnd the Knights of Ren? What a fucking disappointment.", "created_at": "2019-12-22T02:45:08.172Z"}, {"movie_id": 181812, "review_id": "5e00e9a826dac10012644d3b", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t know by now, I\u2019m a massive Star Wars fan. I love the original trilogy, but the prequels\u2026 not so much. However, Disney\u2019s sequel trilogy has delivered two of my favorite movies of the whole franchise, so its conclusion was obviously one of my most anticipated moments of the year. If that wasn\u2019t enough to leave everyone excited, add the fact that it also means the end of the Skywalker Saga, and the pressure suddenly becomes 10x heavier. I went in with moderately high expectations, with not even a glimpse of any trailer or TV spot, just like I did with Avengers: Endgame. The latter surpassed my expectations and delivered a near-perfect conclusion to the Infinity Saga\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Rise of Skywalker is a tremendous letdown. I won\u2019t sugarcoat it. If someone told me at the beginning of the year that J.J. Abrams wouldn\u2019t be able to offer a satisfying end to the nine-episode story, I would laugh like crazy. It disappointed me so much that I don\u2019t even want to extend this review more than the usual. I know that a lot of people hated The Last Jedi, but for better or worse, that film exists. Rian Johnson\u2019s decisions were made. Some people received them well, some didn\u2019t. But all of us got to watch and experience his narrative.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s something called artistic integrity, which J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio completely forgot about. The lack of respect for the saga\u2019s previous installment is baffling. The structure-less screenplay is so unbelievably convoluted that it reaches a point where evident logical issues come into play. Major plot points occur due to some genuinely hard-to-believe events, and even the characters seem to have no path whatsoever. It\u2019s entertainment for the sake of entertainment.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are a lot of visually jaw-dropping action sequences. The cinematography (Dan Mindel) is some of the best I\u2019ve seen in the franchise and in this year. John Williams\u2019 score is emotionally compelling, and it definitely elevates a lot of important moments, being a big source for the chills down my body. And yes, there are a bunch of epic scenes. However, throughout the whole runtime, the frustration was always there. Major threads and character backstories were answered in The Last Jedi, but The Rise of Skywalker feels more like another sequel to The Force Awakens than to Rian Johnson\u2019s flick.\r\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one undeniable aspect about this trilogy that this last movie proves is that there was no plan. No roadmap. No overall structure. Whether you love or hate each or every installment, this is indisputable. Disney screwed up this time. Creative freedom is essential to filmmakers, but the production team behind a franchise needs to have a well-organized structure. The simple fact that J.J. Abrams directed the first film, left and returned to do the third one, is already weird and uncommon by itself.\r\n\r\nBesides the lack of artistic integrity, there\u2019s this feeling of constant disappointment throughout the movie. On several occasions, The Rise of Skywalker is so close to delivering a perfect sequence. A chill-inducing moment. An incredibly emotional scene. Almost every time, it fails at the last second, at the last line of dialogue, or at the last action movement. Some moments are still captivating, and they don\u2019t lose that much impact. Nevertheless, some are totally destroyed by the most ridiculous, cringe-worthy choices I\u2019ve witnessed in the saga.\r\n\r\nThe first act is devoid of any thought. Characters go to places to get something they need to another place so that in that place, they find something else that leads them into another place\u2026 It\u2019s frenetic, out-of-control pacing. The desperation to set up so many different side stories in time is so prominent that it\u2019s visible from another galaxy. From the second act on, things get a bit more clear, and in the third act, all the threads blend decently. It\u2019s in the last 30 minutes that the resemblances to Avengers: Endgame come into play. The only difference is that it doesn\u2019t have 1/10 of the emotional impact due to the questionable decisions I mentioned above.\r\n\r\nOnly one character got his arc complete without detours or significant changes: Kylo Ren. J.J. set him up, Rian Johnson continued his journey, and J.J. closed his arc pretty well. Every other character either got their arcs complete with major changes throughout, or they didn\u2019t come close to finish their own story. There\u2019s one exception, though, and that\u2019s Carrie Fischer\u2019s Leia. It would be extremely disrespectful and unfair for someone to criticize the filmmakers about her. They inserted her reasonably well in the scenes (please, if someone complains about visual effects, just get lost), and they did the absolute best they could under the known circumstances. I might be extremely disappointed, but I do have to send the team my congrats for closing her arc in the most dignified way possible.\r\n\r\nAs for everyone else\u2026 well, the cast has been outstanding from the very beginning. Adam Driver, I have no words for him. He\u2019s so perfect as Kylo Ren that I even defend his character as a villain more layered and emotionally complex than Darth Vader. I love Daisy Ridley as Rey, and she does a phenomenal job in this last film, even when her dialogue doesn\u2019t entirely suit her. John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and everyone else (who I won\u2019t mention due to possible spoilers) are all brilliant, and I have to congratulate them on making every single movie a bit better.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what more should I write. I have very mixed feelings about it. I love a lot of the epic moments, the film looks absolutely stunning, and the action sequences are genuinely jaw-dropping. However, I strongly disagree with some decisions made by J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio, especially the ones that make The Last Jedi feel like it didn\u2019t exist. This lack of artistic integrity plus the constant disappointments regarding each big moment\u2019s climax ruins one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Despite the brilliant performances from the cast, only Kylo Ren got his arc complete without significant changes. The Force Awakens set up some mysterious questions. The Last Jedi answered them. The Rise of Skywalker\u2026 also answered them. It\u2019s one of my biggest letdowns ever, but I\u2019ll still save the Skywalker Saga close to my heart.

The film traverses the stories of the previous films in order to bring all those stories together for a culmination that is truly satisfying. The cinematography and visual effects as usual are outstanding in the film but this film seems to have a unique feel that adds to the foreboding tone kept consistent throughout. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley as Rey and Kylo truly shine in this film and are both giving their a - game and prove that they are both incredible actors and extremely emotionally flexible (particularly Ridley). The Arc of Kylo Ren is by far the highlight of this trilogy and in this film and the conclusion of said arc is immensely satisfying, Reys story also takes a surprising turn which I found immensely satisfying in hindsight. As a conclusion to my favourite series of all time I was left immensely pleased with the final sequence of the film which brings all of this lore together in a way I couldn\u2019t predict to be this poignant.

It's somebody else's story, and Rian needed me to be a certain way to make the ending effective. That's the crux of my problem. Luke would never say that, I'm sorry \u2013 well in this version. See, I'm talking about the George Lucas_ Star Wars_. This is the next generation of_ Star Wars_, so I almost had to think of Luke as another character. Maybe he's Jake Skywalker.

On the other hand, it's a bit of a meta approach to the story. I don't think that people go to_ Star Wars _to be told, \"This doesn't matter.\"_\r\n\r\n- J.J. Abrams; \"Will _Star Wars_ Stick the Landing? J.J. Abrams Will Try\" (Dave Itzkoff); _The New York Times_ (December 11, 2019)\r\n\r\nRian Johnson's _Star Wars: The Last Jedi_ (2017) was a film which divided critics and audiences to an unusual degree \u2013 on Metacritic it has a critical score of 85/100 (the second-highest in the franchise), with 53 positive reviews against zero negative, but its audience score is only 4.4/10 (the lowest in the franchise), with around 3,000 positive reviews against nearly 4,500 negative. In their (predominantly negative) reviews of _Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker_, many critics who championed _Last Jedi_ posit that the film was a great work of art, unfairly maligned by a toxic fanbase pissed off that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was in a perpetual bad mood and that Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) was unacceptable because she wasn't white. And certainly, there was an element of that in the reaction some diehard fans had to the movie \u2013 the racist and sexist abuse that Tran took from such fans was shameful, and the very definition of toxicity. However, these critics essentially argue that if you didn't like _Last Jedi_, the _only_ possible explanation is that you're a racist, misogynistic, reactionary, right-wing Neanderthal \u2013 it certainly can't have anything to do with simply disliking the movie because you disliked the movie. And of course, such critics don't mention the horrid screenplay that spends 40 minutes on a side-quest that has nothing to do with the rest of the film; they don't mention how Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) withholding her plan from Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) makes not a lick of sense; they don't mention Luke throwing away his lightsaber (to hell with that scene); they don't mention how General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) was turned into comic relief; and they sure as hell don't mention resurrected flying space Jedi (to hell with that scene too). The fact is, the film is an absolute mess, and it has zero to do with skin colour or gender.\r\n\r\nAnd so, one must ask, is _Rise of Skywalker_ a course correction or a flat-out apology? I'm leaning to the former, but there can be no doubt that much of what _Last Jedi_ introduced into the canon has been unceremoniously discarded \u2013 Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is once more wearing his mask and the Knights of Ren are back; the Jedi child seen at the end of _Last Jedi_ is never mentioned; Rey's (Daisy Ridley) parentage, so casually dismissed in _Last Jedi_, is once again crucially important; Rose, that most maligned of characters, has gone the way of Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), and is barely seen. Indeed, _Rise_ is more of a sequel to J.J. Abrams's _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_ (2015) than it is to _Last Jedi_, one or two major plot points notwithstanding, and whilst _Last Jedi_ looked forward, clumsily introducing new concepts and themes to the franchise, _Rise_ follows _Force Awakens_ in doing the opposite \u2013 it looks back, and is chock-full of throwbacks and references to the previous films. And although I certainly enjoyed it as a spectacle (it looked and sounded exceptional in 3D IMAX), there's no doubt it's a deeply flawed piece of work. It's the kind of film that feels like it was created by a computer algorithm or a corporate committee trying to tick as many boxes as possible \u2013 rather than attempting something ambitious which fans _might_ not like, it's far more concerned with trying to please everyone without offending anyone. And this is only one of two impossible tasks it assigns itself.\r\n\r\nPicking up the story a few months after the events of _Last Jedi_, the war between the Resistance and the First Order is still raging. However, a recent development has altered the playing field and taken both sides by surprise \u2013 Emperor Sheev Palpatine/Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) has returned, having survived the events at the end of Richard Marquand's _Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi_ (1983). Revealed to have literally created Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) in a lab, Palpatine has been manipulating events from behind-the-scenes for years and now plans to harness the immense combined power of every Sith who has ever lived. As the film begins, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren, who assumed the mantle after he murdered Snoke in _Last Jedi_, is making his way to Palpatine's base on the 'hidden' planet Exegol, which can only be reached with the use of a powerful Sith Wayfinder, of which there are only two in existence. Seeing Palpatine as a threat to his leadership of the First Order, Ren is planning to kill him. However, rather than doing so, he watches in awe as Palpatine reveals a massive armada of hundreds of fearsomely powerful _Xyston_-class Star Destroyers. He then orders Ren to find and kill Rey. Meanwhile, with Luke dead, Rey is continuing her Jedi training under his sister, Leia Organa (a cobbled together 'performance' by Carrie Fisher, comprised of a combination of unused material from the previous films, body doubles, and CGI). When Poe and former First Order stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) discover that Palpatine is on Exegol, Rey learns of the necessity of the Wayfinder from Luke's notes. And so Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and the droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2, BB-8, and D-O set out to find it.\r\n\r\n_Rise of Skywalker_ is directed by _Force Awakens_ director J.J. Abrams (_M:i:III_; _Super 8_; _Star Trek: Into Darkness_). Colin Trevorrow (_Safety Not Guaranteed_; _Jurassic World_; _The Book of Henry_) was originally hired as writer/director, but he left/was fired from the project after clashing with franchise producer Kathleen Kennedy, who seems to have a bit of a thing for firing directors, and who was dissatisfied with the script by Trevorrow and Derek Connolly (_Kong: Skull Island_; _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_; _Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu_). In the credits for _Rise_, Abrams and Chris Terrio (_Argo_; _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_; _Justice League_) are credited with the screenplay, working from a story credited to Trevorrow, Connolly, Abrams, and Terrio, although Terrio has said in interviews that the Trevorrow/Connolly credits were a legal requirement, and nothing of their script remains in the final film.\r\n\r\nAnd this brief bit of background chaos serves to help illuminate what is probably the biggest problem with both this film and this new trilogy as a whole \u2013 lack of narrative through-lines. At no point during _Rise_, not for one second, did it ever feel like the culmination of a nine-film arc. Hell, it barely felt like the culmination of a three-film arc. As already mentioned, _Rise_ seems more like a sequel to _Force Awakens_ than it does to _Last Jedi_, but the problem runs deeper than that; not only is there a modest disconnect between the three films in the sequel trilogy, but there's a much more important and sizable disconnect between this trilogy and the previous two \u2013 George Lucas's _A New Hope_ (1977), Irvin Kershner's _The Empire Strikes Back_ (1980), and Marquand's _Return of the Jedi_ and the Lucas-directed prequel trilogy; _Episode I: The Phantom Menace_ (1999), _Episode II: Attack of the Clones_ (2002), and _Episode III: Revenge of the Sith_ (2005). \r\n\r\nLove them or hate them, the prequels do feel like they take place in the same narrative space as the originals; they not only form a coherent and logical trilogy in and of themselves, but (Midi-chlorian foolishness aside), they also form a coherent and logical six-film arc with the original trilogy. In short, the prequel trilogy has very strong and narratively organic connective tissue to the original trilogy. Lucas himself has spoken to this connective tissue, pointing out that when you watch the originals, it's Luke's story, but when you watch the six films, it's Anakin's story. When you factor in this third trilogy, however, despite Disney dubbing the nine films the \"_Skywalker Saga_\", the overarching story essentially becomes Palpatine's, as he's the only constant in all three trilogies (apart from C-3PO and R2-D2). However, whilst Palpatine's presence in the first two trilogies is integral, woven intricately into the fabric of everything that happens, his appearance here is\u2026less so. This has the effect of making the nine-film sequence feel unbalanced, with the last three never really managing to feel like a valid continuation of the previous six. At best, they feel like a spin-off, with thematic connections and recurring characters occasionally shoehorned in to try to establish narrative continuity, but, by and large, they're their own thing \u2013 which is not how Disney has sold them at all. \r\n\r\nAll of which leaves _Rise_ with not one, but two impossible tasks \u2013 1) to somehow conclude this trilogy in such a way that it also works as the satisfying closing chapter to the nine-film _Skywalker Saga_, and 2) to somehow conclude this trilogy despite having to abandon and retcon much of what the second film did.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this trilogy's disconnection from the others was brought into relief for me by something my uncle said when we were discussing _Rise_. He's a fall-down drunk who talks to trees and may be involved in a plan to resurrect Hitler as a gay sushi chef, but he has a very interesting perspective on the _Star Wars_ films. To paraphrase, he said that to him _Force Awakens_, _Last Jedi_, and _Rise_ never felt like _Episodes VII_, _VIII_, and _IX_ \u2013 rather they felt like _Episodes X_, _XI_, and _XII_, and the \"real\" _Episode VII_, _VIII_, and _IX_ were never made. This isn't him arguing that Lucas's ideas for the third trilogy (which were rejected by Disney) should have been used and would have been awesome \u2013 rather his point is more structural; this trilogy is built on a serious of major events which take place between _Return of the Jedi_ and _Force Awakens_, which we never got to see and which fundamentally divide this trilogy from the other two. Had we been made privy to these events, however, these last three films would have had a much easier task of integrating into and ending the twelve-film _Skywalker Saga_. I have to admit, it wasn't something that had occurred to me, but the tree to whom he pitched it really sold me on the idea when it told me over the phone, and it does make a lot of narrative sense \u2013 had this been the fourth trilogy rather than the third, its connection to the first six films would have been much more organic, the story much more contiguous, and the task of bringing the entire saga to a close considerably less daunting.\r\n\r\nOf course, a big question is whether or not Disney had a specific narrative plan going into this thing, with many arguing that the lack of coherence between the three films proves that they did not. But that seems somewhat unbelievable to me. Rather (and again, I have to credit my uncle with this), it's more likely that Abrams laid groundwork for a coherent three-film arc, but Rian Johnson was more concerned with making a Rian Johnson film than a _Star Wars_ film, and ignored (if not necessarily undermined) much of Abrams's preparatory work. This also feeds into the criticism that the first hour of _Rise_ is too plot-heavy and expositionary; which could be explained if he was essentially in a position of having to do two films' worth of work in one, because plot points that should have been emphasised in _Last Jedi_, to set up the events in _Rise_, simply weren't.\r\n\r\nThe big thing here is the return of Palpatine, which has been argued to be completely arbitrary, a desperate bit of fan service from a filmmaker trying to win back fans, and which doesn't make a whole lot of narrative sense. I can certainly sympathise with those sentiments, and I agree that his return negates Vader's sacrifice at the end of _Return of the Jedi_ and makes a mockery of the whole \"_restoring balance to the Force_\" prophecy in the prequel trilogy. However (and this is the final reference to my uncle), there were a number of hints in _Force Awakens_ (that I did not pick up on) that a big bad was pulling the strings and that that big bad was Palpatine. To explain any more would constitute spoilers for _Rise_, but there are videos on YouTube posted shortly after the release of _Force Awakens_ which speculate (correctly, it turns out) that Palpatine might be involved. Taken together, it's enough to convince me that his return wasn't as arbitrary as it may seem. And although the fact that it seems that way at all is still a major problem, that's more likely the fault of Johnson rather than Abrams.\r\n\r\nThere are some smaller issues with the film, however. For example, there are far too many shots of Rey staring off into the middle-distance as she senses something (usually connected to Ren). The film also tends to treat death less than reverentially; no less than six characters die, only to return in some form or another, which cheapens and undermines both the goals of the characters and the inherent risk in attempting to achieve those goals. The quartet of main characters also remain as insipid as they were in the previous two films \u2013 Rey never gets beyond the reluctant Jedi trying to wrap her head around everything; Finn never gets beyond the token good guy who used to be bad template; Poe never gets beyond Han Solo-lite; and Ren never gets beyond the moody emo who hates his parents and so is rebelling against them by hanging out with a questionable crowd of intergalactic fascists. As you do. The structure of the plot is also poor, far too repetitive, and relying too heavily on coincidence. The biggest problem is that the whole film is built around the Resistance trying to get to Exegol. To do so they need the Wayfinder, but to get that they need this other thing, but to find that they need to go here and speak to him, but to do that they need a mystical doohickey but to get that they have to\u2026you get the picture. The whole film feels like a series of video game quests.\r\n\r\nSomething else that bothered me is a semi-spoiler, so skip this paragraph if you wish. Mimicking the scene in _A New Hope_ where the _Millennium Falcon_ swoops in to save Luke in the final battle, there's a shot towards the end of the film where a massive fleet of thousands of Resistance ships is revealed, led by Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). But where did such an armada come from? How was Lando able to assemble so many ships in such a short space of time (he has no more than a couple of days)? If such a fleet exists, why not use it before now? Visually, it's a spectacular shot, but the grandiosity is achieved by sacrificing logic.\r\n\r\nFor all that, however, I have to admit, I enjoyed _The Rise of Skywalker_ for the most part \u2013 it's a fine spectacle taken on its own terms, very loud, very over-the-top, and very entertaining. One thing that's come in for a lot in criticism is the number of callbacks to previous films. And there certainly is a lot, but, generally speaking, I thought they were fairly well-handled, logical enough and reasonably organic. For example, Palpatine tells Ren that some people consider Sith abilities to be \"unnatural\", which was exactly what Palpatine told Anakin (Hayden Christensen) in _Revenge of the Sith_; Poe and Finn are shown playing the holographic chess game on the _Falcon_; the turret gun on the _Falcon_ still has the old-school graphic readout as seen in New Hope; during her training, Rey uses the blast shield on her helmet whilst fighting a flying bot, another reference to _New Hope_; characters sink into quicksand in a scene reminiscent of the garbage compactor scene in _New Hope_; a character Force-lifts an X-Wing from a swamp just as we see Yoda doing in _Empire_; there's a scene of Palpatine and Rey watching a nearby space battle, just as Palpatine and Luke do in _Return of the Jedi_.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, as one would expect, everything looks and sounds great, particularly Palpatine's base on Exegol. Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel (_John Carter_; _The Amazing Spider-Man 2_; _Pacific Rim: Uprising_) shoot these scenes like it's a horror movie \u2013 deep chiaroscuro shadows, ominous caverns disappearing in the background, unnaturally powerful lightening flashing from above. This tone is helped immeasurably by the production design by Rick Carter (_Forrest Gump_; _A.I. Artificial Intelligence_; _Avatar_), which really sells the vast otherworldliness of the place. Equally important here is the sound design by David Acord (_Guardians of the Galaxy_; _Avengers: Age of Ultron_; _The Secret Life of Pets_), which features a constant chatter of unearthly and disembodied voices, like a thousand ghosts all whispering at once. \r\n\r\nThe whole thing has a dark vibe the likes of which we've never really seen in _Star Wars_, and the scenes here are probably the best in the film, from a craft perspective if nothing else. The scenes showing Rey and Ren speaking to one another via Force Dyad are also excellent. These scenes were easily the best part of _Last Jedi_, and they're just as good here, as we see the background of one character's location appearing behind the other character, with the backgrounds shifting from one to the other as the scenes play out. A lightsaber fight makes particularly good use of the Dyad, with events in one location having an unexpected effect on events in the other.\r\n\r\nSo, all things considered, although I enjoyed _The Rise of Skywalker_ and found it a vast improvement over _Last Jedi_, it never touches greatness. Everything feels workshopped and focus-grouped to within an inch of its life, and the spark of originality that was so prevalent in the original trilogy and less so in the prequels seems almost extinguished. It looks great, and it's both exciting and entertaining, but it's also safe and predictable in a way that none of the films were when Lucas was still in charge. And sure, you might say that fans rejected _Last Jedi_ because it took too many risks, and now they reject _Rise_ because it doesn't take enough, and there's probably some truth to that. But the fact is that the film never feels like a closing chapter, not because it looks like there'll be more chapters, rather because it never seems to know how to conclude the story with much in the way of satisfaction. I enjoyed it whilst I was watching it and it's a decent enough _Star Wars_ movie, with some terrific individual scenes. But as the final entry of a 42-year-old franchise (the most popular franchise in any medium in human history), the whole thing is, perhaps inevitably, a little disappointing.", "created_at": "2020-01-07T03:45:25.542Z"}, {"movie_id": 181812, "review_id": "5e2f275ac56d2d001a4e4868", "rating": 4.0, "review_text": "\u201cDo it!\u201d\r\n\r\nI\u2019m surprised they added that in there despite all the memes.\r\n\r\nAnyway\u2026\r\n\r\nA long time ago...four years to be distinct; the space opera \u2018Star Wars\u2019 returned to cinemas with \u2018The Force Awakens', that brought back the bittersweet experience that fans have been craving for over 30 years. Well lets just say Christmas was magical that year. While I wasn\u2019t quite as wowed as everyone else, but I still enjoyed it otherwise and I was interested where the story will go after J.J. Abrams left his \u201cmystery box\u201d of questions for another director to answer. How exciting and epic the next years will be.\r\n\r\nAnd then the sequel and two spin-offs happened. Well lets just say my interest for these new movies has completely evaporated. Sad times indeed. And no I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being overly negative in the heat this movie is receiving, because right now, at this very moment, my thoughts and overall feeling on this movie are genuine, and re-watching it isn\u2019t going to safe it. I\u2019m not disappointed or angry, because at this point I stopped caring.\r\n\r\n\u2018Rise of Skywalker\u2019 is a factory made movie with no heart, no soul, and no magic. Words and phrases like: bold, epic, and satisfying - are not the type of words that I would describe this final chapter in the Skywalker saga. I can\u2019t call something bold if it played things incredibly safe. Each movie exists just to shred up and apologize for what came before it.\r\n\r\nJ.J. Abrams can be hit or miss sometimes, but I must admit he had a difficult task to follow up on \u2018Last Jedi\u2019 and Rian Johnson undoing his mystery box questions. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the death of Carrie Fisher also had a massive effect on the story, and including her into the movie, while respecting her legacy and giving her as much screen time with the limited deleted footage they have. Abrams sadly treads on familiar ground and doesn't really handle the originals (or even the prequels) with respect. This is literally a remake of \u2018Return of The Jedi\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe story in this movie is almost nonexistent. It\u2019s so rushed that you can\u2019t catch a breather amidst the chaos. Nothing flows naturally. Characters running around and jumping from location to location. I think the quick pace easily hides the poor writing and plot holes. I also thought the title crawl is a bit off and felt it was written by a Reddit user. From the moment the movie starts until it ends nothing makes a lick of sense.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest waste of opportunity is the character of Finn, because the potential of greatness was set up in \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019, and they didn\u2019t do a single thing with it. I mean, a Stormtrooper who revolt against the corrupt and sinister empire, which is something we haven\u2019t seen before. Heck, a long time ago he held a lightsaber. Unfortunately in this movie he\u2019s a comedic buffoon that sweats and shouts a lot. What a waste of John Boyega\u2019s talent. They did him dirty.\r\n\r\nI like Daisy Ridley, not so much on Rey. I don\u2019t want to jump on any bandwagon here, but I don\u2019t understand how someone can be so over powered and skillful at the force with barely any training. Whenever there is training it\u2019s over before you know it. There was a point where I said to myself, \u201cWho taught her to do that?\u201d, or \u201chow the hell did she do that?\u201d. I really struggled to emotionally connect with Rey, because there\u2019s nothing more dull than a character with no flaws or growth.\r\n\r\nThe strongest element throughout these three movies was Kylo Ren by the magnificent Adam Driver. This guy literally carried this series on his back. At least his character as an arc, and not just wasted potential. I actually connected with his inner conflict between the dark side and the light side.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography looks beautiful and absolutely striking. The visuals and music will always be great with these movies regardless on the actual movie.\r\n\r\nEmperor Palpatine is back...for some reason. The vague explanation of why he\u2019s back made it clear to me that Disney had no plan from the start for these new movies. Still, Ian McDiarmid is fantastic as always. He oozes with evil and soaks up every wicked moment of it.\r\n\r\nThe awkward and ill-placed comedy from \u2018Last Jedi\u2019 is still present and it got worse and worse as it went along. With this being the finale, new characters still get introduce and get some development. Like, why are you introducing new characters now? Billy Dee Williams returns as the slick and classy Lando, but sadly doesn't really do much for the story. Richard E. Grant is great as the ruthless new commander of the First Oder with the small screen time he has. Dominic Monaghan, on the other hand, feels like an extra. Rose Tico has a smaller role this time around and her entire love triangle with Finn from \u2018Last Jedi\u2019 gets brush under the carpet. Kelly Marie Tran sure can\u2019t catch a break.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences with the lightsaber fights and space battles were mostly forgettable. Even the scenes that stick to mind wasn\u2019t that special. The camera fails to capture focal points with the grand scale lacking.\r\n\r\nI like how there\u2019s a lesbian couple towards the end that\u2019s on screen for about two seconds. So when the studio want to market the movie for China, they could easily edit out it to make it more \u201cmarketable\u201d. How progressive Disney.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: An unsatisfying conclusion.

Beyond him, nothing else really works, even the direction from Abrams felt old, besides, not a big fan of CGI vs CGI battles (like in Transformers), lacks a certain weight and thus suspense.\r\n\r\nFurther shame, now that the Skywalker Saga is done, as poorly made as the prequel trilogy was under the direction of George Lucas, even he wouldn't pass bringing Han (Ford), Leia (Fisher) and Luke (Hamill) together.\r\n\r\n**2.5/5**", "created_at": "2020-03-20T21:43:39.013Z"}, {"movie_id": 181812, "review_id": "5e7d5b0c13a320321727b9a2", "rating": 4.0, "review_text": "When it comes to \u201cStar Wars,\u201d being a fan comes first and a film critic comes second. I was four years old when I saw the original, and I\u2019ve been a huge devotee of all things in the galaxy for forty plus years. This isn\u2019t a review written by a disgruntled fan, as I have grown to love Rey, Poe, and BB-8 almost as much as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and R2-D2. But when a movie is so careless with its beloved characters both past and present, it\u2019s something that can\u2019t be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe Skywalker saga comes to its disappointing end in this (supposedly) final chapter. The recycled story is basic and mostly predictable, as the surviving Resistance rallies together to face the First Order for one final battle. So much is shoved into this movie that it feels like a pressure cooker that\u2019s being forced to tell a too-rushed story. It becomes frustrating early on.\r\n\r\nI realize \u201cStar Wars\u201d is a touchy subject and fans will always be debating the films until the end of time, but \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d is one of the more mediocre entries in the series. From the reveal of Rey\u2019s (Daisy Ridley) origins to the head-scratching actions of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to the disappointing conclusions for Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe\u2019s (Oscar Isaac) stories, this thing stinks to high heaven. Almost everyone does things that are totally out of character, events happen that make absolutely no sense within the Lucas-created universe, it seems like more questions are raised than are answered, and new rules of what the Jedi can and can\u2019t do seem to be made up on the fly because they make for convenient story arcs.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not usually a literal filmgoer but this movie is so poorly plotted that its myriad problems are too abundant to ignore. Since this is a spoiler-free review I can\u2019t divulge them here, but those who\u2019ve seen the film will be able to name at least half of the dozen or so massive problems within seconds.\r\n\r\nParticularly shameful is the inexcusable way Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), who was a major character in \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d is discarded like trash and relegated to a very minor background role in this film. Perhaps a defense could be constructed that she didn\u2019t quite fit into this part of the journey, but I say hogwash. This is absolutely a decision that feels like it was done to appease angry internet fanboys who screamed and howled about Tran and her character behind the anonymity of their keyboards. Kowtowing to bullies is a colossal setback to the very themes that root the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise.\r\n\r\nFurther aggravating to life-long fans is the sparse emotional connection that stems from the film\u2019s many fakeouts. There are zero consequences to the movie\u2019s most shocking moments. It\u2019s a crappy thing to do because it assures a near-complete loss of trust from your audience. For every gasp-inducing jolt and hold-for-tears touching moment, a sense of betrayal almost always follows.\r\n\r\nEven worse is the quality of the filmmaking.
