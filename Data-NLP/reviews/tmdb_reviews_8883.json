It does probably overrun a little with a 130 minute run time and could pick up the pace here and there, though overall this historical drama from 2008 makes for intruiging viewing. It's very well made.\r\n\r\nI had no knowledge of the real life of those portrayed, so it's good to learn of their World War II involvement; albeit with the usual stretched truth/fictionalization/whatever that films tend to do. The titular characters are played by Thure Lindhardt and Mads Mikkelsen, both give super performances as the former particularly impresses.", "created_at": "2023-10-07T12:28:59.755Z"}]
