Some of the shots are gorgeous, the framing that Costner uses in close ups is excellent, and the final reel shoot out ranks as one of the best in Western genre history.

It escalates into a life or death situation. Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner play the two main cowboys while Annette Bening appears as a doctor and Michael Gambon a land baron.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen Range\u201d (2003) automatically brings to mind \u201cDances With Wolves\u201d (1990) because they\u2019re the only two Westerns Costner has both starred in and directed. While not quite as good, this one is still a great modern Western and nigh epic. The theme revolves around how noble Westerners like the protagonists don't seek violence, but it's sometimes necessary to make a stand for justice, even if the local law is bought and corrupt.\r\n\r\nI like the way the movie confidently takes its time and fleshes out the characters with insightful bits here and there. It feels like the way it was in the Old West and the characters speak the way you know they spoke back then. The mood is increasingly tense, but most of the action is saved for the last act when everything explodes, reminiscent of the real-life gunfight at the O.K. Corral, just longer. As such, viewers who need quick-editing and constant thrills to be entertained will likely find it boring. Mature-minded viewers, however, will appreciate the realism and the slowly developed characters, as well as the well-done romance angle.\r\n\r\nThe big rancher is pompous because his arrogance has built up over the course of decades and he thinks he owns the town. But does he? In his own mind he\u2019s King Sheet because he\u2019s gotten away with injustice due to his power and influence. But what happens when noble citizens say \u201cEnough\u201d?\r\n\r\nWhile \u201cOpen Range\u201d deals with dark, challenging things, it has a warm, redeemable heart, unlike \u201cUnforgiven\u201d (1992), which wallows in ugliness (although it\u2019s still a worthy Western, as long as you can stomach the ugliness).          \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot at Stoney Indian Reserve in Alberta, Canada. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-", "created_at": "2021-03-14T05:38:41.503Z"}]
