Nevertheless, even if it aspires to be nothing more than a simple horror flick, it falls short in providing consistently thrilling moments to warrant a fifth instalment in the franchise. Fans of the \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d series will be the target audience for this film, and if you fall into that category, you\u2019ll enjoy it because not only does it follow the same exact formula as the previous films in the franchise but also expands on the world they\u2019ve already established and includes a satisfying twist at the end.\r\n___\r\nRating: **5.2/10** *(Nothing Remarkable)*", "created_at": "2022-11-02T11:13:12.450Z"}, {"movie_id": 227348, "review_id": "64bf204d8ee49c00ac4c0a70", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "It wasn't a bad movie, but it doesn't really go with the other 4.
