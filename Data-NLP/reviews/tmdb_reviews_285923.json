[{"movie_id": 285923, "review_id": "5bc39a0a0e0a266e5904e316", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "***Zombies, dancing skanks, rednecks and killer stunt cars***\r\n\r\n\u201cGrindhouse\u201d (2007) features two separate movies: \u201cPlanet Terror\u201d by Robert Rodriguez and \u201cDeath Proof\u201d by Quentin Tarantino. Together, they\u2019re called \u201cGrindhouse\u201d because they\u2019re a deliberate attempt to recreate the experience of a double feature at a B movie house in the mid/late 60s-70s with the prints intentionally marred by scratches and blemishes or, in one case, a whole reel supposedly missing. Trailers for fake movies, like \u201cMachete,\u201d are also part of the package.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlanet Terror\u201d involves a biochemical outbreak in central Texas that (big surprise) turns people into zombies and the ragtag group that teams-up to fight \u2019em, led by Freddy Rodr\u00edguez and Michael Biehn, the latter a sheriff. Hotties Rose McGowan and Marley Shelton are on hand, the former acquiring a machine gun implant in replace of her amputated leg. (How exactly she pulls the trigger to massacre zombies is anyone\u2019s guess).\r\n\r\nThe movie comes across as a melding of \u201cFaster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\u201d (1965), \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d (1968) and \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d (1978), but with the modern tone of \u201cSlither\u201d (2006) with its gross, deliberately offensive black humor. McGowan is a highlight throughout, especially her opening go-go sequence whereas Freddy Rodriguez is surprisingly formidable. Their romantic arc is kind of touching. Another point of interest is the quality cast, rounded out by the likes of Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews and Fergie. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, though, \u201cPlanet Terror\u201d fails to rise above the low-budget sorta-genius of Syfy schlock like \u201cFlu Bird Horror\u201d (2008), \u201cWyvern\u201d (2009) and \u201cSasquatch Mountain\u201d (2006) even though it cost literally twelve times as much. GRADE: C\r\n\r\n\u201cDeath Proof\u201d involves an embittered stuntman (Kurt Russell) and his psycho obsession with murdering young women of dubious character with his death proof stunt car (but only the driver\u2019s side). The first half is very good, hindered only by the inane chatter of the girls. This kind of dull drivel goes into overdrive in the second half, particularly involving  Zoe Bell, Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson, but is rewarded by a thrilling car chase in the country that\u2019s supposedly Tennessee, but obviously Southern Cal.\r\n\r\nRussell\u2019s character is perversely charismatic and the movie perks up whenever he\u2019s on screen. There are no less than eight female co-stars playing mostly classless types (but not all of them) and, depending on your tastes, four of them are quite alluring,: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier (yes, Sidney\u2019s daughter). GRADE: C+/B-\r\n\r\nThe two movies and additional trailers run 3 hours, 11 minutes. Unless you have that kind of time to blow, I suggest watching the movies singularly.\r\n\r\nOVERALL GRADE: C+", "created_at": "2018-10-14T19:33:30.129Z"}, {"movie_id": 285923, "review_id": "5e20656be004a6001398f066", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Grindhouse exploits its modern B-movie experience through a bloody expressionistic tribute. Two feature films. Four fictional trailers (five if you\u2019re lucky...). And an authentic conceptual presentation of the 70s exploitation genre, missing reels and all. Rodriguez/Tarantino\u2019s admiration for cinema in general is tangible. Both a credible experiment in genre resurrection and a fetish for babes, blood and bolted machine gun legs. It is, at its core, a retrospective piece of entertainment. But does the double feature presentation, trailers included, work as a solid film in itself? Yes. Just about.\r\n\r\nTwo of the four fictitious trailers worked. Wright\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t\u2019 replicated the essence of Hammer Film Productions perfectly with a quintessential amount of British campiness to illustrate the ghoulish plot. Not to mention the laugh out loud vagueness of the title. Roth\u2019s (yes, this is surprising...) was another hilarious trailer with \u2018Thanksgiving\u2019, a holiday-themed slasher. Imitating existing features, such as \u2018Halloween\u2019, to deliver a barrage of nudity and decapitations. Absurd, yet sadistically amusing. These two especially suited the overall aesthetic of Grindhouse, particularly with \u2018Planet Terror\u2019. Rodriguez\u2019 \u2018Machete\u2019, which later became a feature film\u2019, summoned the desolate heat of the Mexploitation sub-genre. It\u2019s fine. Occasionally becomes lost in itself when Trejo is randomly throwing machetes everywhere. Zombie\u2019s efforts in \u2018Werewolf Women of the SS\u2019 (I know...) didn\u2019t work for me. The concept felt like he was trying way too hard in being over-the-top and radical by merging a bunch of sets together. Intentional or not, it juxtaposed the other trailers. Cage as Fu Manchu though, I want more! Although varying in quality, these trailers do provide impressive contributions to the overall presentation and are embedded intricately before each feature film.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of features, do both \u2018Planet Terror\u2019 and \u2018Death Proof\u2019 work as a project of duality? No. The former is an absurdist\u2019s perspective of the zombie genre, whereas the latter just resembled an ordinary Tarantino flick without the excessive exploitation. The two, together, have different paces, styles and tones which exhume varying levels of contrast, diminishing the whole feature\u2019s flow.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s plenty of passion and heart being injected into this project, ultimately resulting in an enjoyable cinematic experience. Yet a prevention exists that disallows me from fully connecting to the concept. A myriad of pastiches, with varying levels of quality, as opposed to an actual presentation. I\u2019d watch it again just for \u2018Death Proof\u2019...", "created_at": "2020-01-16T13:30:19.987Z"}]
