[{"movie_id": 10610, "review_id": "608638892da8460029831048", "rating": 3.0, "review_text": "This action-fantasy-comedy has bad dialogue and a half-baked and uneven plot where even some Chan's martial arts/stuntwork isn't nearly enough to save it, and besides, half of the movie uses some shoddy special effects so his stunts aren't nearly as impressive. On the plus side, the movie is a reminder on Claire Forlani's beauty (acting was only so-so at best). The Medallion has so many hallmarks of the early 2000s style of filmmaking with the choppy editing and lame humor. **1.75/5**", "created_at": "2021-04-26T03:50:33.643Z"}]
