[{"movie_id": 9075, "review_id": "5f3049a4cdf2e6003720d742", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "_**Carice van Houten plays a spy working for the Dutch Resistance during WW2**_\r\n\r\nDuring the German occupation of Netherlands in WW2, a Jewess singer turned spy (Carice van Houten) gains access to the Gestapo headquarters to help the Dutch Resistance. Sebastian Koch plays a sympathetic German officer while Waldemar Kobus is on hand as the heavy. Thom Hoffman plays an agent for the Resistance. \r\n\r\n\u201cBlack Book\u201d (2006), aka \u201cZwartboek,\u201d is a Euro WW2 film by Paul Verhoeven that balances drama, action, intrigue, romance and suspense. It\u2019s reminiscent of contemporaneous flicks like \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d (2009) and \u201cValkyrie\u201d (2008). It\u2019s not great like the former, but it\u2019s in the same league as the latter. \r\n\r\nDespite its length, the story movies along swiftly, albeit awkwardly on a couple occasions. Carice shines in the challenging key role and Koch is likable. There was one scene that I didn\u2019t find convincing, but it was forgivable. Unfortunately there\u2019s a twist in the last act involving a character that doesn\u2019t gel with the character\u2019s previous actions.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 25 minutes, and was shot in the Netherlands with the bookend scenes filmed in Israel and studio work done in Brandenburg, Germany. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "created_at": "2020-08-09T19:08:20.313Z"}]
