Halle Berry is a diver whose on/off boyfriend Olivier Martinez manages to coax her into taking an arrogant, wealthy, Brit and his son on a cruise to swim with sharks.

The dive footage of the sharks would have made for an interesting documentary on apex predators; the story ought just to have been shredded at birth...", "created_at": "2023-08-07T11:42:27.755Z"}]
