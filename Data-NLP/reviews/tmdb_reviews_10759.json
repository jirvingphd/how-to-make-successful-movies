If you like Naked Gun, Scary Movie, Not Another Teenage Movie, or any other kind of spoof then this is worth a watch. \r\n\r\n**3 Reasons To Watch**\r\n\r\n1. Relentlessly spoofs popular sports movies. \r\n2. David Koechner as Lambeau Fields? I'm in. He's one of those underrated comedic actors of our time.\r\n3. It has Stacey Keibler and Lawrence Taylor cameos. Enough said.\r\n\r\n> Coach's Daughter: I wanna have what you and mom have! Coach Lambeau Fields: Herpes? \r\n\r\n**How I Rated It:**It's a solid 2.5, which 1) I'm a hard ass and 2) It's an average rating. Doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it at least once to laugh at.", "created_at": "2021-07-17T14:57:42.659Z"}]
