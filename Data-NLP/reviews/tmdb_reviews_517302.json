[{"movie_id": 517302, "review_id": "632f2c55387651007e24e661", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "When a bird finds it's way into their living room, the young \"Tinja\" (Siiri Solalinna) wraps it in a cloth and gives it to her mother - who promptly breaks it's neck! Somewhat distraught by this, the young would-be gymnast is out in the forest later where she discovers an egg. She takes it home, and incubates what turns out to be a rather large creature that has a distinct symbiosis with her. As it grows and develops, it can clearly read her mind and act upon her thoughts and actions as it develops human (and cruel) traits. Will she be able to control this rather menacing looking hatchling - especially in the face of increasing animosity towards her increasing domineering mother (Sophia Heikkil\u00e4) and annoying and scheming little brother? The story is all a bit too predictable here, to be honest, and the acting isn't really up to much either - the direction and photography offers us just a bit too pristine a look to the film to help engender any sense of peril. The creature is well put together, though, and that does illicit a combination of pity and fear when used to it's best effect. Sadly that is all too infrequently and for the most part this is a rather clunky family melodrama. Watchable, though, just not really very memorable.", "created_at": "2022-09-24T16:12:05.454Z"}]
