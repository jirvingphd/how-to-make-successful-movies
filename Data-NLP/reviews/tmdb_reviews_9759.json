Chris Evans is the recipient of a strange phone call from a woman (Kim Basinger) who has been kidnapped and as she is locked in an attic, she must rely on this random young man to try stop the baddies (Jason Statham etc.) from now reaching her young son and her husband on their quest for we know not what... yet! He goes to the police station but a fracas in the lobby means he cannot discuss with a detective and so must now do it all by himself...

Evans is good value, and William H. Macy isn't afraid to get in tough with his inner vanity; but otherwise it is a bit of a wasted opportunity for all...", "created_at": "2023-09-04T05:00:13.816Z"}]
