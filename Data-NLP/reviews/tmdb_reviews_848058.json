Carlota Pereda takes advantage of the terrific lead performance from Laura Gal\u00e1n, and delivers a shocking, violent, frighteningly grounded story about bullying, fat-shaming, and self-acceptance.\r\n\r\nDespite taking a more revenge-driven approach, the filmmaker beautifully develops the moral concepts at hand. The romantic subplot doesn't really work, though, and the film would have benefited from a stronger atmosphere. In addition to this, just a couple of impactful dialogues surrounding the main themes would have drastically improved the overall piece.\r\n\r\nStill, it's definitely a must-watch.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "created_at": "2022-02-21T19:17:57.860Z"}]
