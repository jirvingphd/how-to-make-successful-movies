Unfortunately, The Vault is not a prime example of this concept when we're speaking in terms of quality. It's cheap, which is not inherently a problem, but it certainly doesn't help when you run into the real barriers like acting, visual effects, audio quality, costuming and set design. But it's still probably watchable enough that I'm going to chuck it onto my _Payday_ playlist.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._", "created_at": "2017-09-09T06:42:09.005Z"}]
