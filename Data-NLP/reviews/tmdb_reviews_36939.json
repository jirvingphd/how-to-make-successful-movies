I understand that it had a point (sort of), but it did feel like there was somewhat unnecessary fan service with her and Heather Graham, and they are unfortunate highlights of the movie.\r\n\r\nThis is all about the \"art world\", which means it's not about art, the quality / value of at all: it's all about capitalism, so it becomes an business / politics movie.  It's all about these people we don't know or care about diddling each other and trying to out extort each other.\r\n\r\nIt would be more interesting if it was a nature documentary.\r\n\r\nWatching rich people shuffle money about for no reason just isn't interesting to me.\r\n\r\nAnd if I never hear Danny Huston laugh like that again, then my life will be better.", "created_at": "2020-09-30T15:07:44.272Z"}]
