Meantime, atop the ice his pals are anticipating the arrival of a baby mammoth while sabre-tooth \"Diego\" is having a bit of a mid-life crisis and \"Scrat\" might just have found love during his latest acorn-tussle. The gang soon realise that \"Sid\" has gone AWOL and that they are going to have to risk life and limb to try and rescue their buddy from his new hostile environment - so off they head into the perilous land of dinosaurs and of the hugely annoying \"Buck\". He's the eye-patched, and very verbose, weasel who claims to be the sort of Allan Quartermain of dino-hunters. From hereon in there are plenty of lively escapades to be had as the franchise quite successfully morphs into the world of the T-Rex and velociraptor whilst helping \"Diego\" feel valued again and getting everyone ready for the arrival of the wooly wean. The soundtrack is interesting - most of it way too old for the demographic, I'd have thought - but the animation is fun to watch with a better story than \"Meltdown\" (2006) and even if I really would have preferred something had eaten the weasel very much earlier on, it's a solid and entertaining outing for everyone and that acorn is still elusive!", "created_at": "2023-11-30T17:21:47.592Z"}]
