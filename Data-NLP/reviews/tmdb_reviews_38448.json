What is the truth? Dervla Kirwan plays the ex-wife, Tony Curran the \u201cstepdad\u201d and Stephen Rea the guiding priest.\t \r\n\r\nWritten & directed by Neil Jordan, \u201cOndine\u201d (2009) is a lyrical coastal drama/mystery reminiscent of \u201cThe Seventh Stream\u201d (2001) and \u201cThe Secret of Roan Inish\u201d (1994). It mixes the haunting seaside fisherman element of \u201cOrca\u201d (1977) with the coastal mysteriousness of \u201cHalf Light\u201d (2006), the romance of \u201cMessage in a Bottle\u201d (1999) and the melancholic folk of \u201cMcCabe & Mrs. Miller\u201d (1971).\r\n\r\nThe filmmaking is artsy with seeming ambiguities, sometimes annoyingly so (depending on your taste), while exploring the concept of wish fulfillment in the face of grim realities. Bachleda\u2019s beauty is tastefully displayed.\r\n\r\nThe characters speak in Irish/Scottish brogue and the dialogue is often realistically mumbled, making it difficult to understand for outsiders. Unfortunately, there are no English subtitles on the disc; so if you watch it via streaming I advise using subtitles. \r\n\r\nThe folk-oriented soundtrack sometimes throws in a welcome oddity like \u201cBathe in Blood\u201d by Evile and \"Then Comes Dudley\" by The Jesus Lizard. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot at Beara, County Cork, Ireland. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "created_at": "2020-08-20T16:51:12.422Z"}]
