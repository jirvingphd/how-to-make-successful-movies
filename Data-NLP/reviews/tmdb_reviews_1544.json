I can't believe this came out in 2005. Twelve years isn't that long ago, however...it fits right in with 2017.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to fall for the main characters. I found myself being torn between wanting Rachel to remain with Heck and wanting her to be with Luce.\r\n\r\nIt's a story of love. Just when you think you've found true love, life throws you a curve ball and complicates everything.\r\n\r\nIn the end, everyone seems to end up where they should be.", "created_at": "2017-09-24T06:20:28.291Z"}]
