It's way better than supposed comedy \"classucks\" like stupid _Caddyshack_ or dumb _Animal House_. Try watching those now. Maybe there are one or two funny scenes in each of those overrated films. _Movie 43_ has many laugh-out-loud moments. It's a bunch of short skits like the over-hyped _Kentucky Fried Movie_ but unlike that steaming pile, this is well crafted. Also, there are two versions of this. The little thread of a story between the skits is different depending on the version you watch. I think it got bad reviews because of ultra sensitive, politically correct critics. People really need to lighten up. 9/10 stars.", "created_at": "2019-03-01T21:15:31.487Z"}]
