Cameron Diaz (Carly) would be the one who I'd class as the most standout, closely followed by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Mark). I like Leslie Mann, while Kate Upton (Amber) and Nicki Minaj (Lydia) are serviceable if not all that good in their more minor roles. Don Johnson (Frank) appears, also.\r\n\r\nToo uneventful, in short.", "created_at": "2021-05-06T00:33:55.438Z"}]
