Jamie Lee Pressly is basically reduced to a male fantasy gag.  I actually like Jake Busey (\"The Frighteners\", I'm unsure exactly why), but his character is specifically unlikeable in this, and barely funny with a one-note joke of being a misogynistic asshole.\r\n\r\nWhile the has some funny moments, there isn't a lot to this movie other than a lesson against gambling and treating women like consumables.", "created_at": "2020-08-19T20:25:05.594Z"}]
