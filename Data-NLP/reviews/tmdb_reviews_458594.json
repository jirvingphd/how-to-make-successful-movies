Some of these issues slowly faded over the course of _Peppermint's_ run-time, though they did still stick in my mind. But the most important thing you ask for from a Revenge-flick like this is some satisfying splatter from cathartic headshots, and _Peppermint_ does deliver on that front. _Peppermint_ is not a big win in my eyes (which is a shame 'cause I was very engaged based on the trailer) but I am glad that it made some money, 'cause if we can get a _Death Wish_ remake, hopefully we can get some more _Death Wish_ clones like this too.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._", "created_at": "2020-08-12T06:01:09.967Z"}]
