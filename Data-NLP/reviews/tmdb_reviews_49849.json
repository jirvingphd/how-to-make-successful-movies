He managed to squeeze them into Indiana Jones, which I wasn\u2019t too thrilled about, and now he has managed to make a western movie with aliens.\r\n\r\nAs you might have guessed, we watched Cowboys & Aliens yesterday evening. Quite an okay movie. I wasn\u2019t as disturbed by seeing aliens in a western movie as I feared. Harrison Ford is\u2026well\u2026Harrison Ford which is always a good thing.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that bugged me was that the alien bit was just illogical in places. We have a space traveling species from the stars and yet it was possible for a bunch of puny humans to not only walk straight up to their space ship, but to climb up on it as well and throw some old-fashioned dynamite sticks into it and blow up their hangar. Come on! And whenever these, supposedly advanced, aliens showed themselves they behaved like animals on crack.\r\n\r\nSure, it made for some nice effects off hacking and slashing aliens but it really brought down the movie as a whole.", "created_at": "2018-02-20T08:21:16.766Z"}, {"movie_id": 49849, "review_id": "609adac5764841003ae3738f", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "This is an interesting concept, unfortunately it's already been done.

Its two things that usually are pretty far from boring. I love Westerns, I love Sci-Fi, this movie should have been a serious popcorn muncher.\r\n\r\nAnd instead it was boring.\r\n\r\nIt's starts off really cool, the wounded man alone in the desert, clearly just after a fight...and then it gives you the very real feeling that you've seen it before, the only difference is the Alien technology on his wrist.\r\n\r\nAnd then it hits a few cliches that you've also seen before in the troupes of Spaghetti Westerns.\r\n\r\nBy then, if it hasn't lost you then you are a really a trooper.\r\n\r\nFrom there it goes into Science Fiction....or more science fiction...but that doesn't improve the film, you're already wondering what you're going to cook for dinner tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBy the time the big reveal hits and you seen the Indians...the dinner your thinking about has turned gourmet and it's seriously going to wow your girlfriend who was kind enough to watch it with you despite liking neither genre.\r\n\r\nAnd by the end of the movie you want to take a nap and are wondering how something like that could have happened in a movie with \"Cowboys & Aliens\" as the title", "created_at": "2023-01-14T01:49:12.645Z"}]
