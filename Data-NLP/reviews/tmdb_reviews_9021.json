I found the plot to this one more consistently enjoyable, whereas the first one starts off stronger than it finishes - I'd still class the 1994 production better, but this is a solid sequel in my opinion.\r\n\r\nTim Allen reprises his role as Scott and continues to be showpiece of the film. Elizabeth Mitchell is decent as Carol, while Spencer Breslin - who is good in <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em>, and yes I like that film - fits his character well. My point being, this has a slightly improved support cast.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the premise itself, it's nothing to take seriously of course but I felt suitably entertained by it. Intrigued to see where the second sequel goes.", "created_at": "2020-10-01T21:11:02.937Z"}]
