Much slower than anticipated.\r\n\r\nSolid performance by Richie Merritt Jr. however, and Matthew McConaughey fully embraced his character.", "created_at": "2018-09-18T11:37:12.678Z"}, {"movie_id": 438808, "review_id": "5c56d669c3a368478ca08513", "rating": 4.0, "review_text": "Forgettable.\r\n\r\nI guess I theoretically could feel sorry for the actual person this movie was based around? Maybe? But not for this character. Nothing about _White Boy Rick_ grabbed me, least of all the utterly never-congenial Matthew McConaughey, who I seem unable to escape recently, desperate though I am to do so.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._", "created_at": "2019-02-03T11:54:17.278Z"}]
