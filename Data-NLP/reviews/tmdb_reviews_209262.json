It just focuses on the death of the president and it's done in such a way that's designed to bring you to tears again and again.\r\n\r\nI'm probably never going to watch this again, it's a little too much for me. But, if you are looking for a film that is going to invoke a visceral emotional response in the audience, than Parkland is the movie for you.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T01:52:51.042Z"}]
