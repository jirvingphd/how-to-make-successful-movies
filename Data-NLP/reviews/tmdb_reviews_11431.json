You can usually find a lot of room within these sub-genres for imaginative examples. They can be wildly different. Romantic Comedies seem to have less leeway. You have a formula that is often used, with minor changes here and there. The characters usually seem to have little in common at first glance, one of the characters usually gets sidetracked by another love interest (in Fever Pitch the love interest is the Boston Red Sox), there is a breakup where one or both becomes miserable, and the one who is \"at fault\" usually has to make a grand gesture at the end to mend the split. And of course there are jokes and romance.\r\n\r\nI think Fever Pitch is an excellent example of the genre. The two main characters are witty and charming and provide a lot of laughs. They are caring people and there is  great chemistry between them. You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy it (though perhaps Yankee fans should steer clear), but like with most romantic comedies, you might want to set your cynicism aside for the duration, especially if you are a guy watching it with your favorite lady. If she is okay with the sports theme, you can let the romantic moments wash over you.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those rare movies that when it comes on, no matter what place it is in the film, I am apt to settle in and watch it.", "created_at": "2020-04-11T00:21:51.598Z"}]
