It's a more haunting sorta creepy, the music and feel of the children's world always reminds me a bit of the movie Coraline when she goes to the other home world. It's just a little too happy and perfect which makes it creepy. The horror elements were there but subtle and an artistic part of the story. I love the twist and backstory you dsicover as terrible and poignant as it is. The ending was also very good and satisfying unlike some movies I find in this genre.", "created_at": "2014-01-18T20:54:32.715Z"}]
