He takes her to Louisiana to meet his family and misadventures ensue. Treat Williams plays the dad and J.K. Simmons the director of the asylum.\r\n\r\n\"Barefoot\" (2014) is an entertaining enough romcom misadventure and part-road movie. Wood is stunning in an innocent, celestial way, but needs to eat some hamburgers. There\u2019s a Prodigal Son angle and the movie leaves you with a warm feeling despite some debaucheries in the first half.    \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot entirely in Louisiana. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "created_at": "2020-11-20T18:32:28.602Z"}]
