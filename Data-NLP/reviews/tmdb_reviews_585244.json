It has a tonne of issues from pacing to story, but it's just a boring film that is unappealing to all the demographics it tries to hit. It's so forgettable that I just remembered Shania Twain plays KJ Apa's Mum. 2020 truly has been a ride.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-i-still-believe-faith-romantic-drama-misses-every-demographic", "created_at": "2020-06-01T04:51:11.566Z"}]
