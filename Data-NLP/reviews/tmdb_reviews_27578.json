Great/funny one liners and action heroes who look like they can actually punch and take a punch. It also features a poor plot with many holes.

The testosterone-filled cast tries hard to make a forgettable, formulaic story borderline enjoyable, but the action set pieces are mostly an incomprehensibly choppy, badly lit mess, despite a couple of admittedly cool, violent stunts. Nice score, though.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C", "created_at": "2023-09-18T15:44:06.950Z"}]
