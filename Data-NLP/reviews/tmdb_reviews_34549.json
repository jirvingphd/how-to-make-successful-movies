Alex D. Linz (Max) is alright, while a pre-<em>'Drake & Josh'</em> Josh Peck (Robe) appears, but everything else is lame.\r\n\r\nThe concept is decent, though the execution is anything but. There's also an iffy love story in there, while the attempted message is a little blurred by the end. It feels like they created a funny short story and turned it into a feature length, without much thought.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this, fair enough. For me, however, <em>'Max Keeble's Big Move'</em> is awful.", "created_at": "2020-10-13T23:02:14.146Z"}]
