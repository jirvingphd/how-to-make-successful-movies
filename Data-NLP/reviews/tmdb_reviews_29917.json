Its references to a pandemic somehow made it much more relevant to watch right now than it would have been back in the day when the film is released.\r\n\r\nSomehow I expected a better, more clever ending to the film but it lacked that element. However, it was a good watch overall.\r\n\r\nWould I watch it again? Probably not. Would I make my friends watch it? Yes.", "created_at": "2020-06-09T18:12:58.581Z"}, {"movie_id": 29917, "review_id": "609ea298e18e3f00405256b4", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Despite the cold and slightly predictable climax, Exam kept me hooked till before the last minute just because I missed a few details which watching it. The actors do an excellent job in keeping you occupied as their characters compete with each other for a coveted, posh, and mysterious job. But more than that it's pure fun to spend 90 minutes with your chums as you keep guessing what's actually up. **7 stars**.", "created_at": "2021-05-14T16:17:28.566Z"}]
