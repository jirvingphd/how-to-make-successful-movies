[{"movie_id": 603206, "review_id": "62404da75a9915005d50d34b", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "This is quite an enjoyable true-life tale of a group of Welsh villagers who form a racehorse syndicate with a few pounds and take their horse to the pinnacle of Welsh steeplechasing. Toni Collette (Jan) leads a pretty mundane existence with husband Brian (Owen Teale). Her evening job down the local working men's club introduces her to accountant Howard (Damian Lewis) who had dabbled in racehorse owning - to his cost - in the past. She is intrigued by the idea, does some research and after drumming up quite a degree of community support, she has managed to cheaply procure a thoroughbred and convince trainer Philip Hobbs (Nicholas Farrell) to train the thing. What ensues is a roller-coaster ride for all the villagers as they meet the triumphs and disasters of their horse \"Dream Alliance\". The story is simple and engaging, as are the supporting performances from Karl Johnson as Kerby, the feisty Lynda Baron and the enthusiastic Dame Si\u00e2n Phillips, who all enter into the rather joyous spirit of the thing. The fate of their syndicate is history, and the film stays fairly true to that, so if you are looking for a couple of hours of gentle entertainment with some rousing Welsh singing, then this is for you. I enjoyed it.", "created_at": "2022-03-27T11:42:31.353Z"}]
