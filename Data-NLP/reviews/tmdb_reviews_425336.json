[{"movie_id": 425336, "review_id": "630d1e5c3d7454007dbf9131", "rating": 1.0, "review_text": "A caption at the beginning of Loving Pablo informs us that \u201cThis film is inspired by real events. Some of the characters, names, and events have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.\" What they don't tell us is that even the protagonists\u2019 nationalities and languages have been changed.\r\n\r\nColombians Pablo Escobar and Virginia Vallejo are played by Spanish actors speaking English \u2013 or, at the very least, trying to; Javier Bardem's English is atrocious and Penelope Cruz's is abominable, and their Colombian accents are just as bad, if not worse.\r\n\r\nTo confuse things further, the characters occasionally say some random words or phrases in Spanish. Now, I don't think it's asking too much of the audience to pretend that the characters are speaking Spanish among themselves even as the actors deliver their lines in English; after all Hemingway did something similar in For Whom the Bell Tolls.\r\n\r\nBut if the characters are supposed to be speaking in their native language, shouldn\u2019t they sound like native speakers? Also, the dialogue should be consistent; i.e., all English all the time \u2013 because otherwise, what language are they supposed to be speaking when they say something in Spanish?\r\n\r\nThis is a Spanish film, about Spanish-speaking characters, written, produced and directed by Spaniards; why they felt the need to tell their story in any other language than that of Cervantes, I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Except, of course, for the obvious reason of appealing to the Anglo-Saxon market, but in this case why go to the trouble of getting Spanish \u2013 especially big names like Bardem and Cruz \u2013 and Colombians actors, only to force them to recite most of their dialogue in English? If nothing else, they could have at least had the decency not to have Cruz narrate the movie.", "created_at": "2022-08-29T20:15:24.748Z"}]
