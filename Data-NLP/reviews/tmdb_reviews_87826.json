This is basically a homage to the Jon Favreau joke from \"Friends\" where he's rich so he tries to do MMA.\r\n\r\nThis has ridiculously good production value for its time, is funny, and has probably one of the deepest and good characters that Kevin James has ever played.  Granted, it might be because he starts as a dirtbag and grows into a good person.\r\n\r\nIt's honestly good enough, that I don't want to talk about his transformation here, other than it's clear in the story concept that he has one (for the story to progress).\r\n\r\nWow, I honestly don't know if I've had a Kevin James movie to heartedly recommend since \"Hitch\", but even if you don't like him, then he gets his the stuffing beat out of him, so at least you'll enjoy that.", "created_at": "2020-11-20T16:11:26.944Z"}]
