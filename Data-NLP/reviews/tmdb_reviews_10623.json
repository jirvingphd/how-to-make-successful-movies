Yet even allowing for the old \u201cleave the brain at the door\u201d requirement for such action comic malarkey, the script is too poor, the acting equally so, while the choreography is weak. The latter of which a big misstep when you have Jet Li and Mark Dacascos fronting the good guy/bad guy axis of the story.\r\n\r\nPlot pitches Li\u2019s ass kicking detective with DMX\u2019s urban thief together as an unlikely buddy buddy combo trailing missing diamonds and DMX\u2019s kidnapped daughter, and that\u2019s pretty much it. There\u2019s no attempts to expand the characters or add some emotional depth to what is meant to be a pretty critical situation.\r\n\r\nIt often feels tired, like a recycling of so many other film\u2019s of similar ilk, originality is out the window here, hell they even get Tom Arnold in to reprise a watered down version of his character from True Lies. Gabrielle Union and Kelly Hu are on hand to add the sexy sizzle in thankless roles, while Dacascos barely registers as an uber villain.\r\n\r\nLazy and redundant, all told, a waste of time for cast and viewers alike. 4/10", "created_at": "2014-06-15T23:33:07.309Z"}, {"movie_id": 10623, "review_id": "5f581a4f05a53300381bc926", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Extremely dumb, but <em>'Cradle 2 the Grave'</em> actually did entertain me.\r\n\r\nThe humour and cast are the strongest parts to this film, it made me laugh a couple of times to be fair. Jet Li (Su) and DMX (Anthony) are the two leads, they aren't all that memorable in truth but at least do have a few good scenes. The main ones I'll remember are in fact two bit part roles in Anthony Anderson (Tommy) and Tom Arnold (Archie). Those two kept things comedic which worked well. Chi McBride is also solid as Chambers, who should've been the main villain in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe premise is borderline rubbish, but the above mentioned things as well as the music/action made sure I was enjoying myself while watching this - that's sometimes all you want.", "created_at": "2020-09-08T23:57:03.878Z"}]
