They should have been dropped it, yet the film was not that bad. It was simple and cute, somewhat better than the previous ones. Basically, there's no story, everything was an adventure and the story came out of it. The adventure of four Smurfs to outdo their arch-rival, Gargamel. They were racing to find the secret village, but with different agendas. They had to face many hurdles before getting close to their destination. After that what came was a surprise. Not for us, but the Smurfs, and following, the story ended with the result of the battle that fought.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarrom' with prominent actors behind the voice-over. Not one of the most expected animation of the year, but some people were, like the kids. The children won't go alone to the theatres, it always has to be with parents/elders/guardians. That is a complicated combination, and the filmmakers has to work on that. Which means making a film that can be enjoyed by them both. So this film is more a children's, but surely some grown ups too can enjoy it. Otherwise, it is a decent film, that's not deserved the poor box office respond it's got. That means, show it to your kids, even if you are not interested in it. That's how it should be!\r\n\r\n_6/10_", "created_at": "2017-08-18T22:29:15.273Z"}]
