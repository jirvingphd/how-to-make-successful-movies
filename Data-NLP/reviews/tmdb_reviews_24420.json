[{"movie_id": 24420, "review_id": "5f4fc6de79b3d400313b2d15", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "_**Reverent drama/romance/fantasy with McAdams and Bana**_\r\n\r\nA young woman (Rachel McAdams) meets a man in a Chicago library (Eric Bana) and recognizes him as the man she loves who has traveled back in time from his future to meet her as a girl. Can their relationship handle the stress of him suddenly disappearing without warning and the complications thereof?   \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife\u201d (2009) is a drama/romance with a sci-fi element comparable to \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d (2004). Like that film, it can be mind-boggling, but both Bana and McAdams make it worthwhile and there are thought-provoking & moving parts. Eric is masculine and charismatic here, really showing off his talents, while Rachel shines as one of the most uniquely beautiful women to walk the earth. Also check her out in the underrated \u201cThe Lucky Ones\u201d (2008). \r\n\r\nThe ending shows that the real problem in America is old, white, gun-toting Republicans.  (rolling my eyes). Now we\u2019re talking fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot in Toronto, Hamilton & Chalk Lake, Ontario, Canada, with establishing shots of Chicago.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B", "created_at": "2020-09-02T16:22:54.360Z"}]
