But sometimes, sequels aren't that good. But we still watched this movie just cause.\r\n\r\nIt was funny although I think the first movie was funnier. The plot is exactly the same, just a different location. Missing friend, can't remember anything because they were drugged by Allen, guns, sex, the usual. Of course Bradley Cooper was a real eye candy. He should make movies like this more often coz he looks so hot!", "created_at": "2017-02-09T10:02:20.224Z"}]
