Story has Moore as a successful doctor who suspects her husband is being unfaithful with his younger students. Hiring a prostitute to pose as a student and catch him in the act, it sets in wheels the motions of untapped passions and deadly emotions.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit Hitchcock lite in truth, but the strength of the cast list always keeps the story interesting. The key turns in the plot are to be taken with a pinch of salt, but Egoyan and his team keep things ethereal as the tech credits are splendidly mounted. A safe and solid erotic thriller, even if it's more low-rent than high-grade. 6/10", "created_at": "2014-11-13T14:52:15.806Z"}, {"movie_id": 28211, "review_id": "62558fe36082eb004fe03300", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Well shot erotic-thriller by Atom Egoyan featuring three good performances from Julianne Moore, Amanda Seyfried (both sharing a steamy sex scene for a mainstream film) and Liam Neeson. Also has a tragic element with Seyfried's character. This is one I've had in my collection for a while but never got around to watching. **3.5/5**", "created_at": "2022-04-12T14:42:43.303Z"}]
