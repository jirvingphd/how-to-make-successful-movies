It is a well-made and entertaining action drama thriller film that tackles some important social issues. The action sequences are top-notch, the cinematography is stunning, and the performances are all excellent, especially those of **Shah Rukh Khan** and Vijay Sethupathi.\r\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed the film's social message. It is important to highlight these issues in popular media, and Jawan does so in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.", "created_at": "2023-09-28T17:02:43.109Z"}, {"movie_id": 872906, "review_id": "6538d76c7fcab3012c236907", "rating": null, "review_text": "Jawan contains all of the massy elements that the audience anticipated for. Other flaws can be overlooked (You know what I am talking about) because it does not bore anyone from the beginning to the end. However, as the film contained more massy and over the top themes, I believe Vijay Sethupathi's character was underutilized. The final fight between SRK and Vijay Sethupathi should have been depicted more magnificently.", "created_at": "2023-10-25T08:53:00.610Z"}]
