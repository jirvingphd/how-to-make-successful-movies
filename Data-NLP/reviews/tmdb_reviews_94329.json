And the decade is almost over. Iko Uwais is clear talent when it comes to this sort of stunt work, and with the exception of a little too much shakey-cam near the start, you get a really look at him (and the rest of the cast) doing their thing, a lesson which the majority of Hollywood action movies nowadays apparently needs to re-learn.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._", "created_at": "2019-01-22T13:18:08.060Z"}]
