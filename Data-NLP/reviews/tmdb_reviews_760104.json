A group of folks rent a house on the farm of an elderly couple. They arrive and settle down to make their porn film. Director \"RJ\" (Owen Campbell) isn't happy when his girlfriend \"Lorraine\" (Jenna Ortega) wants to join in and determines to skedaddle in the middle of the night. Suffice to say, he doesn't quite manage and next thing the whole load of them are in peril of their lives. This contains one of the daftest old age sex scenes I have ever seen, but that is all I found even vaguely memorable about this rather derivative film. Sure, it's got an hungry alligator but the ending is weak, and the characters just parodied everything crass from the tacky late 1970s adult entertainment industry in a really flat, sterile, fashion. Takes too long to get going, and certainly does not need to be seen on a big screen. More V than X, I'd say.", "created_at": "2022-04-04T14:25:55.484Z"}, {"movie_id": 760104, "review_id": "6326c001bbd0b0007ab2bc96", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Certainly a messed up horror-thriller, this had its moments but I'm not sure how much replay power it has.

What a refreshing entry into the modern-day horror genre. So many movies are either plagued with remakes or supernatural elements, it is so nice to see a back to bones hack and slash. This movie does way more than that though, deep down there is a very heart touching story about growing old and becoming irrelevant. It is so interesting to be so emotionally connected to the killer but yet disturbed by the actions they take as well. I just cannot get over how good this movie is! The gore, the setup, the dialogue, the plot, everything about it I dug. Extremely excited to see what Pearl has to offer later this month.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _93%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Masterpiece_", "created_at": "2022-10-14T17:57:33.885Z"}, {"movie_id": 760104, "review_id": "6444cf5005822402fb331e23", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\nTi West is a great visual director, and you can count on his films looking polished and amazing. Such is the case with \u201cX,\u201d the first film in his series of slashers (including the prequel, \u201cPearl,\u201d and the upcoming \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d which is currently in development). While \u201cX\u201d was released first, I would still recommend watching \u201cPearl\u201d beforehand. Either order is fine, but I think screening the prequel and keeping the actual story timeline in order makes the most sense if you\u2019re just starting out. \u201cX\u201d features grindhouse style horror that offers an homage to 1970s classics like \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d but the film also lends a unique, fresh spin on the genre.\r\n\r\nThe year is 1979, and aspiring adult film actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) is joined by her cast and crew (Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega, Owen Campbell, and Martin Henderson) to make a different kind of pornographic picture. The group ventures to a remote farmhouse in rural Texas to shoot their film, but something feels \u201coff\u201d about the elderly property owners Howard and Pearl (Stephen Ure and Goth, in a dual role). Their reclusive hosts are unaware of what\u2019s going on out back until they catch the performers in the act. This sets off a chain of very violent events that has everyone fighting for their lives.\r\n\r\nThe retro horror setting serves the story well, even if it has the most basic of plots. What makes this script (penned by West) stand out is the dry humor and interesting, well-written characters that have a lot of depth. It doesn\u2019t take long to start to like and care for these people, which makes their inevitable demise hit a little harder. West\u2019s script includes themes of aging, ambition, voyeurism, and jealousy, all tied together with the joy of setting yourself free from repression. Stifled desire causes the elderly couple to begin their killing spree, but there is so much more underneath the carnage.\r\n\r\nThe film features explicit bloody violence, gore, nudity, and sex, earning its hard \u201cR\u201d rating. West doesn\u2019t turn his camera from the bloodshed even when the audience instinctively looks away. If you aren\u2019t accustomed to horror, this film may not be for you.\r\n\r\nThe cast is comprised of terrific indie actors who trust their director onscreen and off, which shows in their work. Being able to feel so free in front of the camera makes it an easier task to also stand behind it, and all of this results in great entertainment for the audience. The movie is fun and smart, if uncomplicated.\r\n\r\n\u201cX\u201d ends with a wholly satisfying finale and avoids the pitfalls of frustrating the audience, as so many independent horror films seem to do. It\u2019s a slower burn for sure, but what a rewarding ride.", "created_at": "2023-04-23T06:25:20.618Z"}]
