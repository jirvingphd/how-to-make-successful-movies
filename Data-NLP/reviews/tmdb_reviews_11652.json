I enjoyed following his character's arc, it is a predictable one but it still produces a load of heart. Greg Kinnear (Dick Vermeil) and Elizabeth Banks (Janet) add a good amount with their supporting roles. I also like those who play Papale's friends, Michael Kelly being one.\r\n\r\nIt takes the usual liberties with what actually happened in real life, but that's not important to me. All I care about is how the film comes out, and this produces a very enjoyable film. I'd recommend it.", "created_at": "2020-11-05T17:08:17.701Z"}]
