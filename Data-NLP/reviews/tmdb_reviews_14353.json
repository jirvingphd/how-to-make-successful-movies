[{"movie_id": 14353, "review_id": "602b299d8258fc003f9e7870", "rating": 10.0, "review_text": "Surprised me to hear when I looked into this feature that it was not well received at the time of its release... disappointing wtf is wrong with people but I\u2019d put this film up there with Rocky Horror Picture Show...\r\nSet in a distant dystopian future where organisms failures are a sure thing, a company named Gencon swoops in on society and sets up Payment plans for people to afford these organ replacements but if payments stopped they sent the \u201cRepo-Man\u201d after you. Starring Anthony Head, Sarah Brightman, Bill Mosely, Paul Sorvino, and Paris Hilton... whose only role as far as I\u2019m concerned that I remember was getting her head cut off in House of Wax he he... \r\nWe have a mother who dies at birth from a poison switched from a possible cure by The Gencon Dude.  But the father thinks it was his fault. Plus him being the Repo Man and Gencon\u2019s little torture slave he must keep this secret from his little Shiloh.\r\nThis being said this modern day gothic musical is narrated by a graverobber played by Terrance Zdunich whom is also the writer of the film as well as the man behind the motion comic segments... he has a powerful voice which isn\u2019t nearly forgotten...\r\nMeanwhile the head dude at Gencon has found out he\u2019s got something terminal that can\u2019t be fixed.  He\u2019s got three deranged children, who seem to be whiny one who reminds my of something in between Texas chainsaw or V for Vendetta.... I especially liked Graverobbbers song 21st century cure and Anthony Heads\u2019 song to his dead wife. As far as location it was obvious much of the set was cgi.   But I don\u2019t think that it took away from the film I think it added to the mystique and the gothicism... I recommend this film for anyone to watch I was impressed and entertains as this wasn\u2019t my first watch.", "created_at": "2021-02-16T02:10:37.923Z"}]
