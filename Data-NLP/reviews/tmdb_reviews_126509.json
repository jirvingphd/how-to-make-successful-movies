So I am giving it 10 to counter balance the BS.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't deserve 1 star, partially because D'Souza made a lot of predictions, especially with the military and killings that came true. But there were others as well, so a part of him had Obama pegged enough to, well, to deserve more than 1 star.\r\n\r\nHowever, D'Souza is a propagandist and this has a clear bias that goes well beyond just being conservative, so he doesn't deserve the 10 stars I gave him either. There are parts of this that are incorrect and parts that have gone far too far.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, he gets 10 stars anyway, mainly because a LOT of the 1 star reviews here are attacking D'Souza because he's an Indian and, honestly, I don't like racists. And those are pretty racist reviews. So I'm counter balancing it.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T03:16:37.093Z"}]
