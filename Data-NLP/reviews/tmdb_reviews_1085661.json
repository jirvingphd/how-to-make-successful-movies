They smacked and kicked him. And they left him half dead in the forest \r\nthinking he's dead. When the night comes, the gangster leader dreamt God of asking him, why it so hard to do good and easy to do bad? He immediately woke up from sleeping breathing deeply and his voice was shaking with fear. He then knelled down & prayed and made a covenant to God that he will take back the money to its owner.", "created_at": "2023-02-12T17:31:52.755Z"}]
