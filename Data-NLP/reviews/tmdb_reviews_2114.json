Soooooo all you have to rely on is the plot, and that is thin to say the least.\r\n\r\nWeak characters, weak plot and really jerky unnatural animation make this once ground-breaking film look awkward and uninteresting.  Couple that with the facts that it bares very little resemblance to the addictive if basic games, and the script feels like it was written with google translate, the whole film ends up feeling flat, confusing and leaves you wanting more.", "created_at": "2018-03-31T07:00:47.337Z"}]
