I mean it\u2019s watchable but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Oscar-worthy. I think this movie is too simple to be nominated. There were some funny parts but it\u2019s more of a \u201cLOL\u201d than \u201cLMAO\u201d. Script wise, it\u2019s nice. It\u2019s kind of real in a way since a lot of people are losing their jobs because of recession. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why people liked this movie because it is what\u2019s happening right now in the USA.", "created_at": "2017-02-09T12:01:41.109Z"}, {"movie_id": 22947, "review_id": "5ec00b09d2147c0023b23bcc", "rating": null, "review_text": "This is one of those movies that takes you in a certain direction but in the end changes course and brings you somewhere else.  It was entertaining but the ending was not the one I was hoping for and I felt diminished the rest of the movie.", "created_at": "2020-05-16T15:47:21.366Z"}]
