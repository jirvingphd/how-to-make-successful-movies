As Will Smith\u2019s love doctor tries to win Eva Mendes\u2019 heart, all of his sophisticated attempts at romance end up at hilariously embarrassing failures that make for some side-splitting laughs. The story is simple but sincere as Hitch learns that finding love isn\u2019t about changing his clients into someone lovable instead, it\u2019s about helping people see how lovable his clients already are. Hitch is earnest, charming, fun, and a must-see for anyone that loves a good rom-com.", "created_at": "2022-10-08T00:29:34.424Z"}, {"movie_id": 8488, "review_id": "6470d217c5ada5013583fc89", "rating": 10.0, "review_text": "One of my favorite movies of all time again. Love this movie! I love movies that have a storyline that's not common in a lot of movies. Thus is also really hilarious.", "created_at": "2023-05-26T15:36:55.867Z"}]
