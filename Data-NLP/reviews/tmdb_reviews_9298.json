I really am not a fan of basically every single thing that Sacha Baron Cohen has done since this, but sometimes, when I'm having a bad day, I sit down, chuck on _Ali G_ and comfortably feel like an idiot for a little while. Very luxurious.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._", "created_at": "2018-09-13T02:06:25.817Z"}]
