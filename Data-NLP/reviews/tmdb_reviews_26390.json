It surely dramatized (it's a film after all), but it doesn't seem to be pulling any punches.\r\n\r\nThe colors, the lighting, the stories that intertwine... pretty damn good. But what I liked the most was that there's no happy ending. It's a not a feel good movie. It's raw, just like life and it's how it should be.", "created_at": "2017-12-17T22:08:04.356Z"}]
