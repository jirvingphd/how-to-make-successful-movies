When their fireside banter is ruined by a missile shaped like a dead cow; things start to liven up and what ensues is a race against time for their very survival - there are more dangerous creatures in the forest than red squirrels! Kevin McKidd keeps the troop focussed at they face their foes with grim determination and their black humour prevails pretty much throughout their ordeal. The special effects are a little bit \"Dr. Who\" but Neil Marshall ensures the lighting and sound folks do their level best to keep the suspense going for a long as possible and at no stage does it hang about: it's end to end action with a tinge - a soup\u00e7on - of horror as the story builds to an enjoyable denouement! On the big screen again now in late 2020 - not sure why - but if you get chance, and you like your horror unsophisticated and funny, then this is definitely for you.", "created_at": "2022-03-28T14:01:35.611Z"}]
