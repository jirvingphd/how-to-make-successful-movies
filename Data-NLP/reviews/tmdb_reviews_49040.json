The acting is top-notch and the plot is just awesome and believable. It starts out a little slower than the previous ones but then it picks up. I can't wait for the next one!

Jeremy Renee\u2019s Aaron Cross has a much more brutal combat style than Bourne, and excited to watch. The Bourne Legacy focuses more on the action and introduces the corrupt network that Cross must battle to bring down and survive. With very little story, the heavy lifting of this film falls on the actors to make it exciting and convincing, which Renner and Weisz deliver with ease. I loved this new direction and these new characters and was disappointed that a sequel was canceled to return to Jason Bourne\u2019s story rather than continuing with Aaron Cross. Thankfully, the Bourne Legacy tells enough story and has enough fun to make it a solid stand-alone action spy film that is highly entertaining and worth a watch.", "created_at": "2023-02-11T03:20:02.271Z"}]
