His filmmaking career seems to have culminated with Deerskin, which is his funniest and most coherent film to date. Mandibles feels like a withdrawn version of Dupieux though. There\u2019s a giant fly, but we don\u2019t see enough of her as we\u2019re subjected to two morons trying to get a free pass on life. Its attempts at humor fall flat and it\u2019s impossible to sympathize with or find any sort of entertaining qualities in any of the characters. Mandibles is really only going to be for hardcore fans of Dupieux\u2019s other works. The average lifespan of a female house fly is 25 days, which is about three weeks longer than Mandibles will stay relevant in the public eye.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Mandibles-2021-Review-An-Unfunny-and-Aimless-Comedy", "created_at": "2021-07-27T13:38:04.897Z"}]
