[{"movie_id": 505058, "review_id": "5c487620c3a3686634850e56", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Something that I've noticed recently in horror franchises that have tried to get off the ground in the past couple of years, the second entry is actually better than the first. In ages past, a thing unheard of, but now at least as common as not. Same goes for _Unfriended: Dark Web_. Just about everything is one step up from the first _Unfriended_ movie: Acting, AV, urgency, the shorter wait times, and the new direction _Dark Web_ takes in terms of its antogonists (I won't spoil it for you, but surely you're capable of reading a title and putting it together for yourself) works better in this one too. I feel at least.\r\n\r\nNow neither of these films are perfect, but the first _Unfriended_ movie was okaaaaaaaaay, and this one has managed to push it by the skin of it's teeth over in to what I could honestly argue is \"good\".\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2019-01-23T14:11:44.517Z"}]
