Acting: aamir and mr bacchan was as usual good, Katrina Kaif still can't act, and that's it. look like people need mrs kaif only as an item girl. Music: just ignore. Action: meh. Desi POTC. And garibo ka Johnny depp jumping from here and there, try to do some impossible stunts. Thank god my cousin paid for my ticket.", "created_at": "2018-11-09T14:15:23.316Z"}]
