I often like Michael Caine but I really didn\u2019t like this particular movie. Some people say this movie is a British version of Clint Eastwood\u2019s Gran Torino but that\u2019s really stretching it as far as I\u2019m concerned. Gran Torino had quite a few bright moments although the film as a whole was perhaps a bit tragic but Harry Brown was really only dark, slow paced and quite boring.\r\n\r\nSure it was well done and Caine sure wasn\u2019t underperforming but the entire film was just too melancholic and depressing for my taste.", "created_at": "2018-06-30T11:18:05.433Z"}]
