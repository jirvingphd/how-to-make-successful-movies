In other words, when you chase monsters, be careful you don\u2019t become a monster. Moreover, if the guy who despises perverted sex offenders so much has no control over his own flaws, how can he blame the deviants? People tend to justify their failures by looking at the misdeeds of others. It's a natural reaction and typically not a conscious one. Actually, justification is what this flick zeroes in on: Is Babbage (Gere) rightfully enraged? Or is he just acting out his own perversions using his occupation as an excuse?\r\n\r\nGere is kick-axx as Babbage; we need more tough-on-predators agents like him out there. As with \u201cThe Enforcer,\u201d you sense a growing connection between his seasoned detective and the newbie (not that they\u2019re police detectives in this case, but they are indeed detectives of a sort). Also on hand are KaDee Strickland (Viola), Avril Lavigne (Beatrice) and Cyd Schulte in a notable uncredited bit (you\u2019ll know when you see it, lol).\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a desolateness to the proceedings which fits the subject matter and the Southwest wasteland setting. There\u2019s also some ambiguity in the last act. The film respects the intelligence of the viewer to put the pieces of the puzzle together. It\u2019s superior to the contrived and implausible \u201cKiss the Girls\u201d and pretty much on par with \u201cTightrope,\u201d but not as compelling as the others noted. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in the heart of New Mexico in Albuquerque and nearby Bernalillo, which is about ten miles to the north.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B- (6.5/10)", "created_at": "2023-12-01T19:55:22.402Z"}]
