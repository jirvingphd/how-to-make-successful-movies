Lots of very predictable plot and complicated relationships, sprinkled with comedy and dancing. Sometimes poetry is enjoyable because it fulfills our expectations. I would say the same of this film. The direction and pacing are perfect, the acting is just under \"over-the-top\" which is also appropriate, and the costumes and dancing were fun. The 170 minutes flew by, which is a high compliment to the director, actors and crew. It's totally worth saving up for that pandemic night when you just want the world to go away.", "created_at": "2021-12-06T15:20:15.446Z"}]
