Now don't get me wrong, I still very much did not enjoy _The Kid Who Would Be King_, but the actual ending did turn me around on it somewhat. Hard to know for certain if this will play well for actual kids. Maybe they'll even take the positive messages on board and not the bad ones. But I don't know that a good message or a good time will be taken away from _The Kid Who Would Be King_ by children, I doubt it, but it doesn't seem impossible.\r\n\r\nVery disappointing after _Attack the Block_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._", "created_at": "2019-06-10T09:40:39.381Z"}]
