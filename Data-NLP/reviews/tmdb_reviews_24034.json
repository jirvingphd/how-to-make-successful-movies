[{"movie_id": 24034, "review_id": "5f2408d45b2f470035549cf7", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Starts off amusing and quirky, but the novelty very quickly wears off.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy the television series then I'd imagine you'll connect with this. I haven't seen the aforementioned so wouldn't know, but as a standalone film it's pretty bad.\r\n\r\nAs noted, it does start off weird - in a positive sense - with Nathan Lane pleasing as Spot, even if it's just him playing Timon from <em>'The Lion King'</em> let's be honest. If you take out Lane it's an irritating set of characters/voices. Away from that, you have the practically nonexistent plot which loses interest with every minute.\r\n\r\nIt would've, at least in my opinion, worked better if they began in the same odd way but then developed an actual plot that's worth following. Unfortunately, they chose the easy way by, I assume, relying heavily on the TV episodes.\r\n\r\n<em>'Teacher\u2019s Pet'</em> is not for me, despite the very short run time. I did appreciate the references to other Disney films, though.", "created_at": "2020-07-31T12:04:36.643Z"}]
