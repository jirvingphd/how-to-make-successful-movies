At least I enjoyed it, despite being an adult, particularly a male and a bachelor. It looks more a little kids' film than for anyone else. Because the film was based on the famous dolls. Usually film comes first and then follows its dolls to the markets. But this film has a reverse concept and a very much acceptable. Yes, it was not great as Disney's or Pixar's animations, but the DreamWorks animation is always there behind these two, considered the third best and according to that limit, you should expect the film.\r\n\r\nIt's a musical like most of the animations are and one of the tracks made into the 2017 Oscars for best film songs list, but the film did not make into best the animated feature. Directed by the director of one of the sequels of 'Shrek' series. Technically, it sounds awesome with cute character models, colours, songs, music and particularly the voice-overs. The story wise, it's not bad, except the concept of eating trolls makes the real young kids go fright.\r\n\r\nGood for families and even better if you choose to watch it in digital 3D format. The runtime was good with a fine pace. In the line of smurfs, gnomes, fairies, and now these trolls to add in the list for children to watch growing up. Don't bother watching it if you are an adult and only like and enjoy adult films, other than seeing it neutral, as well as opinioning. Purely an entertaining film and I strongly suggest it for the little ones.\r\n\r\n_7/10_", "created_at": "2017-02-14T21:27:27.363Z"}, {"movie_id": 136799, "review_id": "658d243bc0442978158439e9", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Anyone recall the toys you used to get where you could push play-dough up through the body and it would come out through holes in the head like coloured hair? Well that's what these \"Trolls\" reminded me of - a wet dream for marketeers, toy makers. and burger chains. The actual plot centres around the peaceable trolls who must flee their home when the menacing \"Bergen\" arrive bent on eating them all for a \"trollstice\" treat. \"King Peppy\" and his annoyingly optimistic daughter \"Poppy\" lead their people to a safe hideaway but a surprise visit from their nemeses means \"Poppy\" and her pal \"Branch\" have to set off to rescue them from the merciless cleaver of the \"Chef\" and the new young \"King Gristle\". What now ensues is a series of escapades as they quite literally have to escape from the pot and the fire, stop their entire population ending up garnished and maybe, just maybe, convince their foes that happiness does not, in fact, come from eating a troll - well not unless it's a chocolate one. This will probably play well to very young children - there are lots of vibrant colours, a few songs to liven things up and just a hint of \"Janet and John\" moralising about what truly matters in life. It's a film you'll watch once, but I doubt it needs revisiting.", "created_at": "2023-12-28T07:31:07.272Z"}]
