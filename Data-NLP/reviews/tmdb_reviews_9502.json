[{"movie_id": 9502, "review_id": "63e4e16adb4ed60081220ffd", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "So the rather clumsy and inept \"Po\" has dreams of saving the world! His real job is working in a noodle bar where one day, maybe, he will learn the secret ingredient that gives their dishes that special flavour. Meantime, the ageing \"Oogway\", the most learned of creatures, has informed his stalwart lieutenant \"Shifu\" that he will soon have to defend their \"Valley of Peace\" from the vengeful \"Tai Lung\" who, though currently incarcerated in a seemingly impregnable prison, is set to come and wreak some havoc. \"Po\" is determined to attend the selection ceremony and, well yes - you've guessed. He ends up selected by the old wise turtle, much to the chagrin and general disbelief of just about everyone else. Hopeless, hapless and helpless - but can \"Po\" prove his mettle and save the day? It's really quite good fun this. The characterisations are well developed and it has humour and style to it too. The animations are lively, vivid and the directors avoid the temptation to allow the combat and action scenes to descend into the all-too-often realms of repetitiveness. There is a moral - the values of teamwork and trust, honesty, integrity yada yada, but the story delivers them in a gentle and demonstrable manner via the plot and the characters rather than pontificating. All in all, this is great family fun that shows the (not so) little guy doing his best... Can he save the day?", "created_at": "2023-02-09T12:04:58.454Z"}]
