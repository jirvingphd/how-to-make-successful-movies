Being so short, you don't get to know Ali Larter's character all that well and felt odd that Jill (Sienna Guillory) and Angie's (Sophie Vavasseur) absences weren't mentioned (that I can remember). **2.5/5**", "created_at": "2020-11-19T19:25:50.599Z"}, {"movie_id": 7737, "review_id": "630019517dfda600826362e0", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "**Overall : The final horror-focused entry of the franchise with high stakes and some great new characters.**\r\n\r\nThe third movie in the Resident Evil franchise and the beginning slide into outright sci-fi action. Most of this entry focuses on survivors attempting to withstand the dangers of a zombie-filled apocalyptic desert. Unfortunately, umbrella\u2019s experiments on Alice have results that sometimes become the focus and begin dragging the franchise further from survival horror. I enjoyed this entry with the addition of Claire Redfield from the games, the return of Carlos Olivera, and the hopelessness of the deadly sun-scorched wasteland continually claiming the lives of the struggling survivors. But Alice\u2019s superpowers distract from the core of what makes this franchise great: surviving zombie horror.", "created_at": "2022-08-19T23:14:25.573Z"}, {"movie_id": 7737, "review_id": "64d1b36d945d3600c573d21d", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "This one is kind of boring till you get to the end.
