So this is my second viewing and don't remember a whole lot but my rating pretty remained the same. It's unnecessarily confusing but worse, rather dull for the bulk with good actors like Aaron Eckhart and Ben Kingsley not being able to breathe life into boring script. Had potential perhaps under a more experienced director but as it is, this is one I won't revisit for a third time... **2.0/5**", "created_at": "2023-12-27T07:13:37.719Z"}]
