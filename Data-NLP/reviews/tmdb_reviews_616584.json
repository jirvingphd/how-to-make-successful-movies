It's an extended series of disparate Melanie Martinez music videos with a wafer-thin membrane of overarching connective tissue. If you are a fan of her music, then, obviously, you should probably watch _K-12_, not even just to \"support her\" but because her music is what makes up 90% of the runtime. Personally though, I don't care for it, which I figured meant the best option I was left with was to basically ignore all that, and just judge _K-12_ on the narrative. Which is not great. Bad, even, I think I could argue. I know that that's not the point, it's not an actual story, it's a music presentation. But to watch this **as a movie** it doesn't work. I even watched _K-12_ with somebody who specifically does like Melanie Martinez's music, and even she was yelling at the screen's nonsense. The pastel colour scheme/lolita fashion thing is also not my speed, but I appreciate the dedication to it. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._", "created_at": "2019-10-02T12:58:46.066Z"}]
