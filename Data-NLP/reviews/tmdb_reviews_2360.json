Both decide to use her talent for horticulture and hatche a plan to grow potent marijuana in a 2 week time frame which can be sold at an astronomical price, thus solving her financial crisis.\r\n\r\nThere are many twists, turns, & romance along the way...The townspeople know a wee bit of Matthew & Grace's plan, but never expected it to turn into the huge amount grown. Grace's first expierience with marijuana is so hilarious, that you can't help but laugh,...just as the entire town becoming stoned when Matthew & Grace are forced to destroy it all before getting caught by the authorities, as well as the huge drug lord that ends up on their tail.\r\n\r\nI've watched it many times, & even my teenagers get a kick out of it, as they think that \"Grandma would be just too funny, if in Grace's position!\"\r\n\r\nKudos to Craig Ferguson, as well as Brenda Blethyn; cast & crew, on an excellent laugh out loud performance!
