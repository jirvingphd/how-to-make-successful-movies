They all follow this storytelling formula that everyone recognizes, but it\u2019s always successful. The protagonist is a miserable human being due to some tragic past. He gets another shot at life, usually an underdog situation, and he ultimately overcomes whatever challenge is thrown at him, including his addictions if he has any. Everyone lives \u201chappily ever after\u201d, and the viewer leaves the theater with a smile because that\u2019s how it makes us feel.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s incredibly easy to root for an underdog trying to raise its level and to reach something it never believed in. In The Way Back, the basketball team is awful, but Jack teaches them not only how to play better, but how to be a better *team*. Then, it\u2019s just like the synopsis: a win here and there gets everyone back on track, and it\u2019s very entertaining to watch these young kids \u201cgrow up\u201d in every possible way. As a sportsman myself, several little details help me enjoy this type of movies even more.\r\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s a straightforward variation of the same cliche, predictable story\u2026 until one point. There\u2019s one genuinely surprising development I didn\u2019t see coming. I don\u2019t know if it was due to my \u201cdefenses being down\u201d or if Gavin O\u2019Connor and Brad Ingelsby really did a great job at hiding it until the right moment, but it definitely worked.\r\n\r\nThe lack of character-building regarding the secondary ones is probably my biggest issue aside from the formulaic screenplay. There\u2019s one young kid that still has some sort of an arc, but it never gets the deserved consideration. It\u2019s a very protagonist-centered film, and there\u2019s nothing truly wrong with that, especially when Ben Affleck delivers one of his career-best performances. I left him for last because I do believe the whole movie succeeds due to his impressively captivating display.\r\n\r\nA lot of people talk about how Affleck\u2019s own life and his past struggles with addiction make this a personal interpretation in the sense that he\u2019s just portraying himself. Some people even diminished his performance by saying that \u201cit\u2019s easier to represent ourselves than a fictional character\u201d, which I couldn\u2019t disagree more. It\u2019s an arduous task interpreting a version of our personality, let alone a very somber, sad part of it. It\u2019s not only an enormous acting challenge but also a terrifying personal test.\r\n\r\nI digress. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less about Affleck\u2019s personal life, or anyone\u2019s for that matter. People should stop trying to bring external themes to reviews, it\u2019s one of the first principles film critics learn (but have unfortunately forgotten with time). I don\u2019t know if his experience with addiction helped him with his performance or not, but he looks incredibly committed to his role. He elevates his character, and he carries the whole movie on his shoulders. Brilliant, emotional, and very realistic interpretation of someone dealing with depression, frustration, anger, and an addiction issue.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Way Back is an inspirational sports drama that follows the genre\u2019s stereotypes and formulaic storytelling, but it\u2019s still very successful in its execution. The secondary characters lack development, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a protagonist-centered story as long as the main actor delivers an exceptional display. Something Ben Affleck does in an emotionally powerful manner, delivering a genuine portrayal of someone with a tragic past and lots of personal issues. I believe it\u2019s one of his career-best performances. Jack might follow every storyline that ever existed in this genre, but Ben Affleck is reason enough to give Gavin O\u2019Connor\u2019s flick a go.\r\n\r\nRating: B", "created_at": "2020-03-31T16:18:37.850Z"}, {"movie_id": 529485, "review_id": "630ad627ede1b0007ed4bd84", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "The Way Back (2020) is a return to form for Ben Affleck following an aimless second half of the previous decade \u2013 specifically his ill-advised stint in the DC Universe. In this drama directed by Gavin O'Connor and written by Brad Ingelsby (co-writer of the excellent Out of the Furnace), Affleck plays Jack Cunningham, a former high school star basketball player turned alcoholic construction worker who reluctantly accepts a coaching job at his alma mater.\r\n\r\nHow do we know he's an alcoholic? Well, drinking beer in the shower is certainly not a good sign (and there are many others), but it\u2019s mostly Affleck, who not only looks and sounds but for all intents and purposes is the part, turning in a cathartic, demon-exorcising performance.\r\n\r\nThe central portion of the film is by design an abridged version of every high school basketball movie ever made. It\u2019s done competently, with a knowledge of and appreciation for the game of hoops, as well as a sense of humor, but it\u2019s nevertheless an afterthought; it would also be a foregone conclusion, if the script had actually been leading up all along to that buzzer-beating, game-winning, hail Mary shot that shortly segues into a freeze frame of Jack\u2019s triumphantly grinning mug.\r\n\r\nIts Cinderella story \u2013 minus the fairytale happy ending \u2013 seems taken right out of many a Hollywood melodrama (because it actually is), but TWB is not \u2013 regardless of what All Movie or IMDb may tell you \u2013 a sports movie, nor is it about basketball like Hoosiers, or about inner city kids like Coach Carter; its scenes of on-court action and sideline banter, deftly choreographed and zestfully written and delivered but offering little new (other than comically pairing the Foulmouthed Coach with the catholic high school\u2019s \u201cteam chaplain\u201d), exist solely to make a point \u2013 and a very well made and well taken point it is.\r\n\r\nThis narrative shorthand serves an overarching character study into which the filmmakers have put quite a lot more thought and work, revolving around a man who seemingly drinks just for the sake of getting drunk, and then gradually pulling back to reveal the underlying causes for, and consequences of, his alcoholism. It is said that hitting rock bottom is the beginning of the road to recovery, and the film uses basketball to pull Jack up, push him farther down, and ultimately pull him back up again.", "created_at": "2022-08-28T02:42:47.396Z"}]
