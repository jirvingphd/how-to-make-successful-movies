Michael Caine and Luis Guzm\u00e1n both act really well with their character kids as well as Dwayne.\r\n\r\nThe biggest actual problem I have with this is the insistence in 3d technology.  It is really blatant and really weird sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe iconic action scenes in this are amazing, and were probably not cost efficient at all:  a giant lizard, bird or fish animated like this looks so good, but lasts for 5 minutes (?) and costs ridiculous amounts of money to get quality as good as this movie does.\r\n\r\nBut it's the \"no expense spared\" attitude that really makes this a good movie watching experience.  Yes, the writing is solid, and I love the idea of visiting the Mysterious Island, but the quality is what puts it over the top.\r\n\r\nWell worth the watch, but its the experience more than anything I can verbally express right now.", "created_at": "2020-09-12T23:12:27.451Z"}]
