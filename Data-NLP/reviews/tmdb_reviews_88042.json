Bette Midler is a (not so) close second, she bounces off Crystal's comedy well. All of the cast that play their family are entirely forgettable, almost annoying in fact.\r\n\r\nThe premise, though it may conclude with a truckload of heart, is boring. It's a tale we've all seen before and it doesn't really add anything different in that regard. It does, to be fair, at least end with a positive meaning which you can't help but appreciate.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, all in all, this fails to the hit correct spot with me.", "created_at": "2020-09-09T02:11:24.038Z"}]
