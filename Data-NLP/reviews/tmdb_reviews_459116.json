That it is somehow racist and evil. That, just because the tables have turned and it's now the Republicans that are defending Free Speech and arguing against segregation, that makes it wrong.\r\n\r\nWe live in a crazy insane world full of people shrieking and attacking others to demand censorship and segregation... and this shines a spotlight on it.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T00:37:26.412Z"}]
