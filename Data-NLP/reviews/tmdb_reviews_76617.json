In some ways, I liked it more than some of the others, but the twist that Leatherface is a wronged victim was just dumb. The lead character finds out she is cousins with Leatherface and sympathizes and begins to care for him as his guardian? After he brutally sawed one of her friends in half in front of her? After he tried to murder her? After he got her boyfriend killed and cut pieces from her best friend? I mean, I don\u2019t expect much from these movies, but that is a leap I just can\u2019t make with you. Just stick with the chainsaw maniac being a bad guy and not a misunderstood vigilante.", "created_at": "2022-09-14T19:07:05.680Z"}]
