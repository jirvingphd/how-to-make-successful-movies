Having a \"world's clash\" aspect to the story seemed unnecessary, and that's the only real hang up this movie had.\r\n\r\nFirstly the movie was supposed to be the opening of a potential franchise to revitalize the Nancy Drew brand, but instead of giving it a strong opening movie, they jumped right in as if there were already 3 movies and they had already jumped the shark a second time.  I had several young people ask me if \"Nancy Drew was a thing?\".  Because it was mistreated in the writing process, what should have been a great movie is only a good movie.\r\n\r\nI really liked this though: Emma Roberts showed early that she was up to carrying a movie, and I love that Rachel Leigh Cook (\"She's All that\") got involved as she was from a different novel based franchise (\"The Babysitter's Club\") that also didn't take off.", "created_at": "2020-08-13T02:04:45.098Z"}]
