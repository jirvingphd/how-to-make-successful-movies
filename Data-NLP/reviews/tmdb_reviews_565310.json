[{"movie_id": 565310, "review_id": "5dcbcf66cc277c0017dfe3c9", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "When a Chinese family finds out that the family\u2019s matriarch is dying of lung cancer, complications arise. In Chinese culture, there is a saying that when you get cancer, you die. This actually boils down to the belief that it\u2019s not the cancer that leads to the person\u2019s death, but rather the fear of dying. As such, the family orchestrates an elaborate ruse to get everyone together for a wedding, but in reality the gathering is for everyone to be able to say goodbye to the grandmother without actually letting her know the truth.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fascinating premise and based on a true story (or based on an actual lie, as the film puts it). Showing aspects of Chinese culture we rarely get to see, the film takes us on a journey to China as we see modern life and urban development. How accurate it really is, I can\u2019t attest to, and there are times that it feels like there should be more or that something is more complex and we\u2019re being given the fortune cookie version, so to speak. The film does steer clear of politics, so that is not a factor here.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful film not just through visual aesthetics but also on a character level. We see how each character faces the impending death of the grandmother differently, such as the daughter-in-law being very matter of fact about it while her husband (the grandmother\u2019s son) is being torn up inside, all while the wise and experienced grandmother continues to dispense advice, oblivious to her diagnosis. It details the variety of relationships we can develop in our life as no two relationships are the same, but they all still love each other despite some distance between certain relatives. There\u2019s something that, despite the comedic premise (it\u2019s sort of a comedy that\u2019s not particularly funny), is very grounded and very real. I couldn\u2019t help but see some of my own relationships reflected on the screen.\r\n\r\nBeautiful, heartbreaking, and at the same time somewhat hopeful, \u201cThe Farewell\u201d comes highly recommended.", "created_at": "2019-11-13T09:39:50.305Z"}, {"movie_id": 565310, "review_id": "5e3aac9a0c2710001375954d", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nLulu Wang shares an emotional part of her personal life by delivering a beautiful, heartfelt story about her grandmother. Even though The Farewell sticks the landing perfectly, not all of the second act\u2019s storylines captivated me, especially the whole wedding narrative. However, Awkwafina offers a fantastic performance, as well as the rest of the cast. Alex Weston\u2019s score elevates a lot of moments, and the drama-comedy balance is on-point.\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "created_at": "2020-02-05T11:52:58.318Z"}, {"movie_id": 565310, "review_id": "609b5de88dbc33002997a56a", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "This movie is described as a comedy-drama and it is. But I didn\u2019t have many laugh out loud moments. The humor is situational mainly: the writers work up to those moments that make you smile, either because you remember a similar moment in your life, or else because you can\u2019t imagine a similar moment.\r\n\r\nAs happens so often, the story is based on real events. I saw where one review title said it is heartbreaking, but I didn\u2019t see that at all. The movie is fairly uplifting in that it shows the strengths of a family that values all of its members, particularly the very old, whose wisdom and experience aren\u2019t as well received in many American families.\r\n\r\nWhen I think about it, nothing definitive seems to happen in the film: no crisis, no climax of action, but this lack of great drama didn\u2019t detract from enjoying the movie. It is all about the journey, not the destination. Enjoy the trip.", "created_at": "2021-05-12T04:47:36.170Z"}]
