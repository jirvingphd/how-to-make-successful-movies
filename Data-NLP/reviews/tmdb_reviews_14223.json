It stars Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes. Music is by Clint Mansell and cinematography by Dan Laustsen.\r\n\r\nTwo students car share for a journey home at the end of term. Taking a short cut they get run off the road and find themselves stranded in the snow. Then strange things start to happen... Neither frightening or dull, Wind Chill is a very serviceable supernatural based drama with human interest factors pulsing away. Setting is superbly chilly, which when our protags are stranded opens up genuine fears for all of us who have ever broken down somewhere remote at night. The revelations and finale are hardly riveting stuff, but it gets top marks for a sense of dread and that for a good portion of film it's not apparent what is actually going on. Two strong performances by Blunt and Holmes help, which ultimately makes this a decent night in by the fire for those not after gore and shrieky boo-jumps. 6/10", "created_at": "2017-01-10T15:02:38.929Z"}]
