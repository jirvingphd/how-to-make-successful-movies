I feel very bad to rate such a low for his film. Literally, there was no story in it. Just a confused character and the events surround him unfolds in a weird way. The characters, settings, I thought it had potential. Visually, it was the same Terry Gilliam style film, but the screenplay failed to have impressive developments. Nonetheless, Christopher Waltz was so good.\r\n\r\nIt is being more a gamer's tale is what turned down. Seeing the title, I anticipated something brilliant or mind-bender. Though most of the film it was the main character who hold the joystick and try to achieve a scientific goal. The Melanie Thierry part was good. Brought some cheers, but did not end properly. The film did not fare well among the film goers. Mostly a mixed response. But I think it was a below average, especially coming from such a great director.\r\n\r\n_3/10_", "created_at": "2017-11-04T19:09:16.080Z"}]
