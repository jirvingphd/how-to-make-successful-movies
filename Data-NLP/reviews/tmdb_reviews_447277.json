I had my doubts since I saw the cast and the character designs (not to mention Ursula's makeup) but these actors have a lot of charisma, the final result is solid and entertaining. \r\n\r\nI love Alan Menken and Howard Ashman compositions, The Little Mermaid and Little Shop Of Horrors are my favorite works from them, their lyrics and arrangements give me goosebumps.", "created_at": "2023-05-27T21:11:22.868Z"}, {"movie_id": 447277, "review_id": "6474658dcc277c0133896d69", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "\"Ariel\" (Halle Bailey) has longed for a chance to meet with humans but her sagely father \"Triton\" (Javier Bardem) has prohibited this. Undeterred, she witnesses a terrible storm that washes the young prince \"Eric\" (Jonah Hauer-King) overboard. She races to his rescue and leaves him to his people on the beach - both are already in love! On hearing of her latest transgression, dad is now truly furious and loses his temper driving his daughter into the manipulative tentacles of the evil sea witch \"Ursula\" (Melissa McCarthy) who offers her a bargain - three days on land to obtain true love's kiss or a lifetime in her service. Snag? Well, she will not have her beautiful voice, she will be a mute. A combination of magic, duplicity and serendipity plays it's hand now and she ends up close to the prince, having adventures with him and falling even deeper in love - but can she get her kiss? Will the wicked \"Ursula\" let her? First things first - this isn't a patch on the 1989 version. It has a clunky, over-produced, musical theatre feel to it that consists of mediocre acting and some serious over-scoring. The delicacy and charm of the characterisations and songs has been subjected to grand orchestrations and whilst Bailey can certainly sing, the delivery is more about her ability to belt out the songs rather to than imbue them with any emotions relevant to the charm of the story. McCarthy is quite effective - if only she would stay still for five seconds and that leads to the other disappointment with this film. It works perfectly as an animation - why introduce elements of live-action to it? Neither the story nor the film benefit from the cluttering mix of CGI and real visuals. As with the recent remake of \"The Lion King\", the song lyrics, for reasons that don't seem clear to me, have been reworked - this time by the always over-rated Lin-Manuel Miranda whose \"Scuttlebutt\" song is just plain annoying. It wasn't broke - why fix it? At times there is a little engaging chemistry between Bailey and Hauer-King, but for the most part this is an unnecessary, and overly long, rehash of a fairy tale that seems to me to have been made because it could be, not because it should have been.

They\u2019ve found varying degrees of success and failure (\u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cCinderella,\u201d \u201cPinocchio\u201d) along the way, and their latest cartoon-to-real-life adventure \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d lands somewhere on the better-than-average scale. There are things that work (a scene-stealing Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the Sea Witch), things that don\u2019t (a painfully lengthy run time), and things I never want to see again (the truly dreadful \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d number), but the film\u2019s reimagined storytelling delivers just enough magic to weather the storm overall.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the classic story of Ariel (Halle Bailey), a curious and spirited young mermaid who yearns for adventure on land. Ariel is the youngest of King Triton\u2019s (Javier Bardem) daughters, and also the most defiant. She spends her days exploring shipwrecks and avoiding dangerous sharks (and humans) with her crustacean pal Sebastian (voice of Daveed Diggs) and her loyal fish friend, Flounder (voice of Jacob Tremblay). On her quest to find out more about the world beyond the sea, Ariel makes a deal with evil sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy) to cast a spell and give her human legs in exchange for her voice. She must find true love\u2019s kiss from the dashing Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) within a few days or the consequences will be dire.\r\n\r\nThe film sticks to the original story, and the fairytale seems outdated. The idea of marrying a handsome prince in a few days is icky, even if it is a fantasy film. It\u2019s interesting how much of the action feels a lot more dire in a live action setting versus in an animated film, with scary eels getting blown to bits and a shipwreck that\u2019s set ablaze as sailors swim for their lives. The worst part of the cartoon to live action translation has to be Sebastian and Flounder, however. It\u2019s startling to see Ariel\u2019s buddies look like a realistic talking fish and crab, and it\u2019s one of the most jarring and unpleasant things about the movie. It takes a lot of willpower to go with the flow, if you can get over the initial shock.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is dark and drab (although it does look as if it\u2019s really filmed underwater), and Rob Marshall\u2018s direction is barely adequate. The film is choppy, slow, and long, and its biggest failure is the uneven pacing. Some of the better parts of the story are hurried along in favor of what should be show-stopping action, but the film is so dark that it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on in what should be the most exciting moments. Why rush the more compelling elements of the narrative in favor for a poorly executed final battle between Ursula and our heroine? It really strips away a lot of the undersea magic.\r\n\r\nThe cast helps keep things afloat, and the performances are all solid. McCarthy is the standout with her robust turn as one of Disney\u2019s greatest screen villains, and Diggs breathes a fresh, new life into loyal crab Sebastian. Casting Awkwafina as the voice of know-it-all seagull Scuttle is inspired, and she creates an updated version of the character that\u2019s the perfect fit for the film. Perhaps the greatest strength comes from the irresistible chemistry between Hauer-King and Bailey, two actors who comfortably step into their lead roles with plenty of charm. She makes a great Ariel, finding a terrific balance of innocence, curiosity, and stubbornness, and he is the perfect non-threatening Prince Charming that is the stuff of many young girls\u2019 dreams.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing the film does right is keeping the original arrangements of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman\u2019s most beloved songs (the updated verses, which removed some problematic and antiquated lyrics, are done well and hardly noticeable). Cherished ballads like \u201cPart of Your World\u201d and \u201cKiss the Girl\u201d have a stirring emotional power that immediately helps audience form a strong connection with the material, even if the movie is just so/so. The soundtrack probably makes the movie seem a lot better than it actually is. The new tunes, including a kid-friendly number called \u201cThe Scuttlebutt\u201d (featuring lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda), sound too contemporary to really fit in, but they\u2019re fun and bring a bit of spirited pep when the film becomes draggy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d isn\u2019t a great movie, but it\u2019s one of the better Disney live action remakes because it stays true to the source material. There\u2019s just enough magic, adventure, and romance to make this a satisfying experience for the whole family.", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:16:20.960Z"}]
