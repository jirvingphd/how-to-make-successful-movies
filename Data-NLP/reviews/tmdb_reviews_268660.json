The plot follows three close cousins' love life. It is looong, but moves quickly. It's not Bollywood, but there's dancing and I found the sound track to be quite different and enjoyable. It's Malayalam, so the translations are just a tad off. And the Hindi dub  .. well, avoid it if you can find the original sound track.", "created_at": "2024-01-03T02:23:46.255Z"}]
