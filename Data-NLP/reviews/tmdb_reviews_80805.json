[{"movie_id": 80805, "review_id": "63ef54fdcddbbc00b2ad641a", "rating": null, "review_text": "A film by SSRajamouli, which is one of 4 movies made by SSRajamouli for Jr. NTR and all of which are critical and box-office successes. Much like other Jr. NTR movies that focuses on actions and has shades of Rakhi in the storylines, this one delivers a twist in the same vein as in Bahubali the Beginning, with a trusted person doing the traitorous deed on the hero, and who has a secondary character as Singamalai. Jr. NTR's physique here tend to distract the viewer and therefore suspends one's belief of a powerful person who is young and chubby at the same time. Story and acting-wise, this is a good movie, delivering several reveals that one isn't even anticipating about and gives a plain satisfaction in the end. NTR is a really good actor and this somehow manages to make NTR the superstar he is right now even after a string of Box Office disappointments.", "created_at": "2023-02-17T10:20:45.789Z"}]
