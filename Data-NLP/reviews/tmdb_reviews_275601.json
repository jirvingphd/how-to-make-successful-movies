[{"movie_id": 275601, "review_id": "577aa9cac3a368770a00207e", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "> Facing what you had left behind to chase your dream.\r\n\r\nThis is so underrated. I mean it is not a great film, but surely does not deserve bashing. One of the rarest appearance on the screen for Meryl Streep. Totally transformed into a rock star and coming together with her real life daughter was another highlight. Impressive performances by others too. The Music was good with a combination of bit emotions and comedy.\r\n\r\nIt was the story of an aging rock star who failed to reach the heights. She once gave up on her family over the passion of music and now she returns after receiving a call that her daughter is in a trouble. So the tale focus on her struggling life, as well as because of her past she won't get a warm welcome. It's time to fix everything and as the years pass what changes brings is the remaining narration.\r\n\r\nThis is life. People are motivated to chase their dreams no matter whatever stands between them. This was a similar theme where a woman goes after what she wanted to be, but her family comes in between. And you know the success is not for everyone, so in that situation, how a person reacts to all the miscalculations in her life is what this film is about. It was actually a well told story, but the critics did not like it and given some lame excuses. To me it was a decent film, definitely not the worst, so all I'm saying is you should try it if you like music.\r\n\r\n7/10", "created_at": "2016-07-04T18:24:10.211Z"}]
