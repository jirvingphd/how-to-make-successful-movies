I learned how to pronounce Diane but not a lot else. That doesn't make it a bad film just not very educational. It's a good idea for a film but doesn't quite hit the mark. Given the artistic license it affords itself it could have gone anywhere but it doesn't really. There are some interesting, quirky and funny bits in it but somehow it doesn't quite hold them together coherently. 6/10 (and one of those is simply for having a TLR Rolleiflex in it)", "created_at": "2023-04-08T23:05:52.717Z"}]
