It made me want to learn more about Alan Turing, but the more I learned, the more I realised how inaccurate this movie is. It is well acted, well produced, well cast, and I would still love it if not for the fact that it differs so much from what really happened that it would have been more appropriate to change all the names and portray it as purely historical fiction rather than pretending it has anything to do with the real Alan Turing.", "created_at": "2022-06-22T11:36:56.499Z"}, {"movie_id": 205596, "review_id": "62dfddd45ca7040b2856cce1", "rating": 9.0, "review_text": "Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic in this movie. I really dug this. Love movies set during WWII and this one encapsulates it brilliantly.
