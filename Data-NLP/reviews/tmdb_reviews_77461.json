I loved her choices which create a crude, rudimentary atmosphere for the film.\r\n\r\nThis is now my 3rd Labaki movie, and it's so easy to see why this Lebanese woman director is racking up awards in all the festivals (42 wins, 37 nominations). In this one, she lances \"religionism\". And rightly so - it's the root of nearly all wars.", "created_at": "2024-01-12T23:40:50.175Z"}]
