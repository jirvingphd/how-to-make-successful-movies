Pine, Knightley, and Costner all bring their best games to this film and do their absolute best to make Shadow Recruit a good movie....\r\n\r\n.... and this is despite the HORRIBLE SCRIPT and mostly incompetent direction. Branagh has always been a better actor than he ever was a director, and when it comes to a movie that needs to be taunt and stressful.... they needed someone else.\r\n\r\nBut then, they also needed a script that could build tension and a director that can work with it, not just do the same trick he failed to execute properly with Frankenstein.\r\n\r\nSo what you have here are three actors conspiring to save a movie... and unfortunately you need more than three actors doing their absolute best to save a film from a poor script and a poor director.", "created_at": "2023-01-11T00:51:40.056Z"}]
