Other cast members include Justin Timberlake, Matthew Lillard, John Goodman and Scott Eastwood - the latter shares a scene with his father, which is nice.\r\n\r\nA few different choices by the filmmakers and I'd be rating this a tad higher, but as is it's a good film - one that is worth a watch.", "created_at": "2022-01-27T02:28:34.472Z"}]
