However, it is said to be set in 1960 but Mengele is driving a 1965 Chevey with several tail/brake lights out (the '65 had 3 left and 3 right). The story also is quite suspenseful. The music is good too. Too bad it took so long for him to become terminated.", "created_at": "2022-08-28T23:48:14.359Z"}]
