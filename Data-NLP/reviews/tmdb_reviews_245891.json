Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wick\u2019s very emotional response to his wife\u2019s death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. What I mean with \u201cno emotional nonsense\u201d is that John Wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an \u201cordinary\u201d guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn\u2019t go into some silly \u201coh should I really pull the trigger\u201d trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys\u2026eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wick\u2019s former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it \u2026 so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or \u201cobligatory\u201d scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is \u201cthe bad guys will pay\u201d all the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.", "created_at": "2015-06-25T06:34:04.317Z"}, {"movie_id": 245891, "review_id": "55c8b6c4c3a3686a820008c9", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "I don't get why this movie has such good reviews.

Let's just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty awesome at that.\r\n\r\nI can't think of anyone else to be John Wick other than Keanu Reeves, the guy's living the character on screen. The hand to hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn't too much noise, no Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you'd expect from a hit-man.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.\r\n\r\nIt is a great action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it's course.

It's also stylish, high energy, and generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here, but if you're squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we've heard this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat's different is the world in which this takes place. There's a secret criminal underground that seems to have their hands in everything, and there's a specific code and honor among thieves. Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn't involved or in the know somehow, so it's implied that this society is very widespread and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick is that he isn't a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo, he's not invincible. He's simply very well trained and determined, which makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know the outcome, there's always this little part in the back of your mind that wonders if he'll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic. Let's be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn't have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane's Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name is John; different spelling means it isn't a shortened version of his name) to Lance Reddick's hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there's a lot of ground to explore.

Chad Stahelski and team break free from the now overused shaky cam to hide mediocre acting and push their stars and stunt team to give us some of the best action sequences in film since The Matrix. But to take this movie even further into brilliance, Stahelski prefers to show and not tell the audience about the world in which John Wick lives. As a result, everything is mysterious, leaving viewers intrigued, questioning, and wholly immersed in this assassin-filled world.

While the story and performances are lacking, the creators make attempts at establishing a greater world around the characters. There are some really creative services and lore that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant. The acting all around is quite lackluster. I love Keanu Reeves as a man, but he cannot deliver dialogue well. I know he is supposed to be very emotionless, but there is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward. His performance does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were a bit better. The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally work for me, but at the end of the day, it is just a vehicle for the action and does enough to propel the story forward. The main focus of these films is the brutality of the choreography. John Wick stacks up a large body count with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics. There are some creative kills in the movie, but most are just headshots delivered by a pistol.
