While I'm really not that big into the supernatural horror genre and have only basic knowledge of the Hellblazer comic, I still found this one mildly entertaining and for 2004/05, the effects weren't too bad, with the hell sequences looking pretty dang interesting, hopefully gets more exploration in the sequel.
