The operation goes awry when a kangaroo inadvertently runs off with one of the guys\u2019 jacket\u2026 and the money. Michael Shannon is on hand as a mob heavy.\r\n\r\nThis is a likable, amusing adventure flick with the typical eye-rolling kid humor (e.g. fart jokes). It\u2019s fun, harmless hokum highlighted by spectacular Australian cinematography and the beautiful Estella Warren as an Outback preservationist. The humorous camaraderie of the protagonists is another highpoint. But the story isn\u2019t as compelling as I hoped it would be and the camera never really captures Estella\u2019s beauty beyond her lovely face and pulchritude.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 29 minutes and was shot in Australia and Brooklyn with reshoots done in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+", "created_at": "2018-06-16T19:53:11.021Z"}]
