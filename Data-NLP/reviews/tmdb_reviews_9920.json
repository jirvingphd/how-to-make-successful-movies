It's a different approach to vampires (hemophages), it's a different approach to sci-fi, and it's a different approach to corporate dystopia.  Oddly, the Umbrella Corporation from \"Resident Evil\" is the closest of which I can think.\r\n\r\nMilla Jovovich is entirely capable of performing high action sequences, and carrying the movie, which she does wonderfully.  I don't doubt that she has some pull in the production process, but the problems in this are mostly the weak character work and the \"I have this really cool idea I'd like to do on screen, it'll be totally different than anything else out there.\" of it all.\r\n\r\nSome of it (nose plugs) are actively distracting, and other things are just odd choices (squared off sword), while there are cool concepts (dimensionally printed weapons), and scenes that just look cool even if they're not especially practical or sensisble (swords on fire in the dark).\r\n\r\nMy only personal gripes are day walking vampires, weird foley sounds for the guns (most are right, but it is hard to tell on made up guns), and why in the hell people with guns would charge someone instead of firing.\r\n\r\nI think this movie holds up as good as it did when it was released, and I have a good time re-watching it.", "created_at": "2020-09-20T21:33:32.755Z"}]
