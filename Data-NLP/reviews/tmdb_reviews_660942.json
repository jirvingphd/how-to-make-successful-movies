[{"movie_id": 660942, "review_id": "62818849cee4810066659cc0", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "_The Innocents_ taps into that boredom you\u2019re faced when you were younger when there was no one to play with and you didn\u2019t know what to do with yourself. The Ida character toys with doing darker things and being a curious tomboy that bites off more than she can chew on most occasions. And while it doesn\u2019t execute everything to its fullest potential, _The Innocents_ is a gradual, unnerving swell of a thriller that takes its time crafting each superhuman element of its familiar yet expertly ominous approach to a film featuring kids with powers. It\u2019s been a long time anything superpower related has felt this somber and spellbinding.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Innocents-2022-Review-A-Story-Driven-and-Tensely-Foreboding-Norwegian-Thriller", "created_at": "2022-05-15T23:10:01.766Z"}]
