[{"movie_id": 342521, "review_id": "580e44559251416e10001839", "rating": 4.0, "review_text": "**How far would you go to save your little pet friend!**\r\n\r\nI was not expecting this film, so I'm not disappointed, but my rating is just what it deserved. I don't know these actors or the director, but that's not the reason I did not enjoy it. The story was average, like it was inspired by the Keanu Reeve's 'John Wick'. I mean, how far a man can go to avenge his pet animal's murder, but here it was a rescue mission. Maybe that's how they got the title, just kidding. A very interesting theme, but not a well written screenplay. This story lacks the clever scenes and dialogues. The comedies were not bad, but I've seen better one in a similar style.\r\n\r\nThe two cousins decide to hangout when one of them is going through the breakup thing with his girlfriend and the other one's family is going on a vacation. Seems everything is fine after they receive an unexpected guest, a kitty to cheer them, but when it goes missing, they plan to track him to get back. So the mission begins and they pose as the notorious drug dealers and go through many hurdles, but will they succeed is what the film is to reveal in the final act.\r\n\r\nWhen the film posters released, I already lost interest in this. Because those imitating posters of other famous films were totally unimpressive. Beside, those kind of idea is old, not anymore fun and I'm tired of them. This is a below average film, but a decent B movie. The production was top notch, but the film did not deliver with the same standards. The twist was good, in the end, it was very common. If you are okay with a simple and silly concept, then this would do just fine.\r\n\r\n_4/10_", "created_at": "2016-10-24T17:26:45.329Z"}]
