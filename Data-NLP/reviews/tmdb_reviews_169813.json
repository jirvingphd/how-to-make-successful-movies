Its story is very engaging, heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.\r\n\r\nI heard a lot about this film before. People kept saying it was one of the best films they have ever seen. While I cannot say the same, it is certainly a film I am glad to have seen now.\r\n\r\nWould I watch it again? Probably not, wouldn\u2019t want to stress myself that much again. Would I make my friends watch it? Yes to that.", "created_at": "2020-06-07T19:10:28.660Z"}]
