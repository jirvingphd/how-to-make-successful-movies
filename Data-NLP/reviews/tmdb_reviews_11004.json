I usually have very little patience for movies about writers because I am one, and I get tired of them bringing up writers\u2019 block, which I don\u2019t believe exists, or else they have the character become wildly successful in record time. There are a lot of struggling actresses and musicians and waitresses in movies, but writers often get fast-track succes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I wander off topic. I enjoyed the movie with its range of quirky characters, and minor plot twists. There are only a couple of two-dimensional characters; the rest are given depth, even a few who don\u2019t have a lot of screen time. It shows what can be achieved with a good ensemble cast and a decent script.", "created_at": "2021-02-08T03:43:33.672Z"}]
