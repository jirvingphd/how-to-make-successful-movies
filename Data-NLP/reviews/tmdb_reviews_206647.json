[{"movie_id": 206647, "review_id": "563e06159251413b1300c821", "rating": null, "review_text": "<a href=\"http://www.cutprintfilm.com/reviews/spectre/\"</a>\r\n\r\nIn hindsight my excitement for Spectre seems a bit foolish. After Skyfall, director Sam Mendes openly stated that he wouldn\u2019t direct another Bond movie. And even so, Skyfall wasn\u2019t the best of the new Bond films by any measure \u2013 dragging on for much too long. But somehow I got sucked into the hype of Mendes\u2019 vision for an homage to the classic Bond, with that somewhat iconic poster of Craig mimicking Roger Moore, and trailers the emphasized a kind of retro re-visitation of some old villains and themes. But Spectre is none of those things, instead it is a film where everyone involved feels like they are just going through the motions. Spectre tries very hard to be an homage to the vintage James Bond classics, but instead ends up feeling more like a mockery of the series.\r\n\r\nFor starters the script is outrageously weak and predictable. Bond goes from shootout, to chase, to sex scene, saying and doing the exact same things he has done for the last 23 movies. Instead of a complete story, the film is just a collection of set pieces and scenes loosely stitched together. And while some of them work well on their own, by the second or third fight scene, you won\u2019t be able to stop yourself from yawning. When you aren\u2019t yawning you\u2019ll be laughing, and not in a good way. The dialogue is downright cheesy. Gone is all of Bond\u2019s smooth charm and ability to sting his opponent\u2019s with his tongue just as much as with his gun. Instead at one point, he throws a watch bomb and says: \u201cTime flies!\u201d\r\n\r\nBond is one a secret mission, assigned to him by M (Judi Dench) via a video message delivered after her death. The film doesn\u2019t ever attempt to invest the audience in this mission, or in Bond\u2019s motivation for seeking out Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) \u2013 which apparently has something to do with his foster-father and his childhood, again \u2013 but it never seems important to the story or to James. Meanwhile, a new joint secretary, Max or C as he is known (Andrew Scott), is attempting to unite the world\u2019s intelligence under one surveillance network \u2013 and through doing so making the Double-0 program obsolete. Lucky for him, Sam Mendes is already doing that for him.\r\n\r\nHowever, Spectre is a beautiful film. There are about five or six huge set pieces, all of which are wonderfully filmed. And if you are just in the mood the veg out and watch Bond cruise through the streets of Rome in a prototype Aston Martin, than this is the movie for you. But things go on for entirely too long, which would be fine if something of interest were happening. But almost nothing does. Bond gets in a situation and gets out, all while throwing a few pithy, laughable, lines out.\r\n\r\nDaniel Craig has never been more disconnected from the character James Bond, than he is in Spectre. I must say first, that I love Craig as an actor and as James Bond \u2013 he is my favorite of all the Bonds. But here, he is uncharacteristically not James Bond. A scene for instance where bond throws his gun into the river, is done in such a fancy foppish way that I cringed. It is tough to properly convey how Craig misses the mark in Spectre, but when you see it, you won\u2019t be able to help feeling the same way.\r\n\r\nMaybe Sam Mendes and screenwriter John Logan did succeed at creating a perfect homage to the Roger Moore era Bond films? Because in reality, none of those films standout as great movies. From start to finish, Spectre feels like someone filling out a madlibs of Bond scenes, and praying that when they read it back, it makes some sense.", "created_at": "2015-11-07T14:09:25.776Z"}, {"movie_id": 206647, "review_id": "563ed3f9c3a3681b4d034302", "rating": null, "review_text": "Well, cinema\u2019s most treasured and resilient British spy guy is back as the legendary James Bond makes his twenty-fourth outing on the big screen in the highly anticipated and slickly-made Spectre. Worldwide Agent 007 fans understandably maintain their embedded expectations and vision as to what calculating and cunning mission their suave and sophisticated gun-toting, martini-sipping espionage thrill-seeker will encounter in his latest globe-trotting episode. Whatever Bond enthusiasts have in mind for the future twenty-fifth entry of the \u201clicensed to kill\u201d Lothario they should simply settle for the present stimulating currents that trickle as mind-bending material in the polished and percolating Spectre.\r\n\r\nAs for the dynamic performer that have served his time with action-oriented cinematic sensibilities through three previous super-charged James Bond installments, the steely-jawed and diligent Daniel Craig is back on the saddle again for his fourth stint as the crafty 007. Naturally both ardent and casual Bond followers can rattle off the filmography of Craig\u2019s on-screen tour of duty as the debonair and daring secret service operative and even rate the previous films as they compare and contrast each edition.  Some may give special attention to Craig\u2019s first foray into stepping inside Bond\u2019s explosive shoes for 2006\u2019s Casino Royale that is considered a spectacular introduction for the dramatically trained actor. In 2008\u2019s Quantum of Solace, it was a mixed bag at best as Bond followers for the most part gave this second 007 rendition an ambivalent sign of approval (not too many were thrilled with the awkward movie title either). Thankfully, 2012\u2019s Skyfall bounced back for Craig\u2019s take on the roguish Bond and made for some exceptional brownie points as the cagey spy returning to creative prominence. Now 2015\u2019s Spectre hopes to make some hearty tie-ins to Craig\u2019s past big screen adventures as the stoic jet-setting dynamo ridding the world of masterful riff raff.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Spectre is serviceable in that it is an elaborate and excitable reminder of the preceding Bond films where bits of nostalgic elements from yesteryear are sprinkled throughout its presentation. Sure, some wily 007 fanatics may spot a few of the tossed in nods to the aforementioned Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in particular as the proceedings unfold. For the most part, Spectre acts as a mere bridge to the launching of the upcoming 25th Bond actioner in waiting. To be fair the other Bond films have served as a welcome mat to the next chapter of the late Ian Fleming\u2019s engaging and charismatic man of action so why should not Spectre be any different in this regard? Still, this spy caper has its signature swagger that Bond aficionados relish with familiarity: heart-pumping action sequences, exquisite locales, desirable and devious Bond women, majestic car chases, larger-than-life villains and their loyal henchmen, imaginative gadgets and inventive technology and yes\u2026the indomitable James Bond at your service. Nevertheless. the minor knock on Spectre is that it could have risen to the occasion more than it did as it occasionally feels as if it is going through the mischievous motions. It never resorts to the levels of Bond-ish drudgery in Quantum of Solace so that certainly is a relief in that aspect.\r\n\r\nSpectre does incorporate its share of opulence, mystery, suspense, shadowy tension and perilous plight. However, where the standard Bond film-making characteristics are somewhat consistent and captivating (i.e. the breathtaking opening sequence of the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City) there is also a questionable consideration for the weak-kneed Bond theme song in Sam Smith\u2019s \u201cWriting\u2019s on the Wall\u201d which seems so inadequately suited for a James Bond signature tune. Even the indifferent observers of the James Bond film franchise for the last five decades can attest to the two most important stamps of a Bond film\u2013its opening scene and surging theme song.  Thankfully, Spectre\u2019s grand opening sequence obeys traditional Bond practices but Smith\u2019s doggedly tired-sounding \u201cWriting\u2019s on the Wall\u201d feels as it belongs attached to an old televised After School special from the mid-70s. Wouldn\u2019t you give your kingdom for Paul McCartney and Wings\u2019 \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d or Carly Simon\u2019s \u201cNobody Does It Better\u201d or perhaps even Sheena Easton\u2019s \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d?\r\n\r\nOne thing that can be said about Craig\u2019s Bond in Spectre and that is his image transformation has been elevated to that of a fashion plate whose GQ stylized look has taken quite a step up. Not since Roger Moore\u2019s Bond has there been a clear case of dazzling attire on display for Agent 007 to strut his stuff in spiffy clothing accessories throughout his ventured travels. Craig, billed as a \u201cblue-collar\u201d Bond whose demeanor is more blunt and workman-like, takes comfort in basking in the finesse shadows of a classic Agent 007 almost foreign to his distinctive spin on the iconic spy. In fact, the overall vibe for Spectre seems to lie in the middle of old school and new school James Bond mythology where the shading suits both camps of the ever-lasting film franchise.\r\n\r\nDirector Sam Mendes, who handled the direction for the previous Skyfall, finds the right tone and temple for Spectre that certainly shows off its lavish and ambitious production values as the set designs, scenic locations, fabulous pre-credits action sequence are all indescribable in majestic scope. No one can accuse Spectre as to not holding its own in visual functionality. Wisely, Mendes does not forget his Skyfall background players as they reunite with Craig\u2019s Bond and partake in the sensationalized cat-and-mouse caper. It is refreshing to see Ralph Fiennes back as \u201cM\u201d not to mention Ben Wishaw\u2019s \u201cQ\u201d front and center. And a Craig-fronted Bond film would not be the same without Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny.\r\n\r\nAgent 007 fans will find a common \"Bond\" with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinettic SPECTRE\r\nAgent 007 fans will find a common \u201cBond\u201d with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinetic SPECTRE\r\nIt is a given that the diabolical criminal network known as SPECTRE has always had its affiliation with the Bond universe especially in the classic Sean Connery Bond-age years. Instinctively, SPECTRE\u2019s evil heart and soul was pumped continuously by that organization\u2019s dastardly mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Oscar winner Christoph Waltz does the sordid honors of taking the reins as Bond\u2019s nemesis Franz Oberhauser in Spectre with devilish delight and is more colorfully corrupt thanks to his handy go-to muscular minion Mr. Hinx (ex-professional WWE wrestler and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d star Dave Bautista) echoing the memories of beloved brute Jaws (played by the late Richard Kiel) from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker). \r\n\r\nWe can never forget that along with Agent 007 folklore comes the responsibility of being labeled a treasured Bond babe. And although the latest sultry women represented in Spectre will never make us forget the iconic likes of Dr. No\u2019s Ursula Andress (Honey Ryder) or Casino Royale\u2019s Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) for that matter they still hold their own and give a measure of titillation to both Bond and the vast amount of male admirers wishing they carried a gun and wore expensive tuxedos while being at the receiving end of a provocative smooch by these vibrant vixens. Lea Seydoux\u2019s Madelene Swann and Italian siren Monica Bellucci\u2019s Lucia are on board as the Bond bombshells for hire.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, Spectre has its up and down moments and never is quite sure about standing alone as an independent Bond story or being dismissed as a pit stop for 007-related flashbacks and reference bits ode to yesteryear\u2019s glory of the super spy\u2019s engaging and raging exploits. The verdict is that Spectre ultimately satisfies one\u2019s craving for the invincible James Bond whether you can to relive his vintage reputation or look forward to a millennium-enhanced production that will grow with the ageless wonderment pertaining to Fleming\u2019s literary ladies man-turned movie-making mainstay of action-packed cinema for half a century. As one-time Bond songbird Carly Simon would attest in her soothing lyrics, \u201cnobody does it better\u2026\u201d  Yet in the dimensional escapist world of James Bond this particular go-around could have been a tad bit better.\r\n\r\nSpectre (2015)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs 28 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, Andrew Scott\r\n\r\nDirected by: Sam Mendes\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Spy-Espionage Caper/Action & Adventure/Suspense Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)", "created_at": "2015-11-08T04:47:53.765Z"}, {"movie_id": 206647, "review_id": "5649fed29251413ad500b5ac", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "A \"correct\" Bond movie.

This change has been since the day one of Daniel Craig as a famous British spy, James Bond. Anyway, he's the most fittest (muscular) Bond I've ever seen and he's celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film release. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with the franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.\r\n\r\nThe end was quite clear on the story perspective, so I kind of felt it was a farewell for Craig. But, later I came to know that the official source says Bond25 will be his fifth and so on till he opts out himself. 'Spectre' was a very simple Bond movie I have ever seen, but I can say the production quality was so good that you can't resist the enjoyment. The actors, they were also good, but not as I anticipated. Maybe many scenes were very ordinary for a Bond movie, that's comparable with the nowadays action movies, otherwise it was not as bad as critics expressing their disappointment.\r\n\r\nYou can't believe what I was disappointed, you know when they say what the C stands for - is that the best word they come up with against the M for Moron? Anyway, James Bond movies have always had ups and downs, the last film 'Skyfall' was a mega hit and now this has not stood up to that standard. But very entertaining with all the actions and unexpected turns in the narration. As a spy movie, it was okay, but as a Bond movie is what might upset you, so its upto you how you look at it. But to be honest, I enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n7/10", "created_at": "2016-02-14T14:48:05.502Z"}, {"movie_id": 206647, "review_id": "6154920881c7be008e08b3f8", "rating": 7.0, "review_text": "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/spectre-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Spectre fails to reach the tremendous potential of its intriguing narrative and fascinating antagonist, but Sam Mendes still pulls off a decent James Bond flick.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay raises significant issues with an incredibly dull subplot that deeply affects the pacing of a bloated runtime.

There were some exceptional action sequences, with the opening scene in Mexico City as one of the most stunning and impressive of the franchise. The train fight with Dave Bautista was incredibly entertaining as well, but much of the action felt restrained like Craig was tired of the role and didn't want to push the boundaries on some stunts.

The motivation of characters other than 007 is total zero in credibility. The inspiration is zero. The strategy is zero. The dialog is clumsy.\r\nThis is to be expected from the changes around 1970, when the writer's guild became immensely jealous of talent and good writing, and only produced the writers with zero talent.\r\nAnd now those writers are the \"judges\" of new writers, God help this culture.\r\nThe change in format should have changed long ago, about 1995, into \"sons and daughters of 007\", with 007 as a background figure, say fifth or sixth billing, with his sons and daughters taking center stage in this \"less action, more computer\" world.\r\nA lot of us said this well before 1995. It was painfully obvious, but we live in a world where Hollywood went total hack in the seventies, with those hacks endorsing the worst hacks of today.\r\n\"Spectre\" kind of gives us an introspective look at this with the timeline element. Bond faces the usual super enemy power, and fights the establishment which brings in the computer age.\r\nThe character of 007 is the only thing that is salvaged in these new movies. It isn't Daniel Craig's fault that he is 007 for the worst writers, writers who are into the neo Nazi ideology of the seventies where women must be blond and pale, and any man who tries to save a brunette is doomed, but save a blond, and you're a success. The Hitler worship is so extreme in the modern Bond movie writing that it's impossible to deny it is there. \r\nAnd the directors are pathetic. Even given the ideal exotic locales, they manage to dumb down the scenery. One feels like the director actually says \"How can we make this beautiful and exotic scenery look dull and depressing? Aha! I can do it!\"\r\nOf course the day will come when Craig will be the beneficiary of this fame and get to do actually good films for which he'll be remembered. \r\nThis movie is pretty much formula.
