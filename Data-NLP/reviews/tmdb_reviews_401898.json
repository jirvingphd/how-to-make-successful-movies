At times it can be difficult to tell the difference between dream and reality.\r\n\r\nWhile the scenes help build up suspense and many things are cleared up towards the end of the movie, the ending was unsatisfactory. Once the secret is revealed, the character takes some questionable actions. Actions that seem like the introduction to a super villain movie.\r\n\r\nIt's not a film I'd watch again, but not a film I'd consider a waste of time. I might give the viewers something serious to talk about.", "created_at": "2018-01-21T23:41:05.295Z"}, {"movie_id": 401898, "review_id": "5bec70000e0a263290000b08", "rating": 8.0, "review_text": "He has an interesting story.
