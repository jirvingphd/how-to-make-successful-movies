Thirty-eight years later, the son of one of the missionaries goes back to the area to reacquaint with the people he met as a child. \r\n\r\n\u201cEnd of the Spear\u201d (2005) is a drama with some thrills based on the true story. Movies with a similar milieu include \u201cFitzcarraldo,\u201d \u201cThe Emerald Forest,\u201d \u201cAt Play in the Fields of the Lord,\u201d \u201cMedicine Man\u201d and \u201cThe Lost City of Z,\u201d even \u201cThe Mosquito Coast.\u201d Sure, this one is more \u2018faith-based\u2019 due to the subject matter, but the director lets the facts speak for themselves with no glossing over and no sanitizing; just the facts. The viewer is left to interpret them.\r\n\r\nIf you like any of those flicks, you can\u2019t go wrong with this one. Even if you\u2019re a strict atheist, the evangelical element is played down. When the biblical message is conveyed, it\u2019s presented in the same way it was given to the Waodani in real-life: In concepts or symbols from their everyday language. For instance, \u2018God\u2019 is replaced with \u2018Waengongi,\u2019 which is the creator god of the tribe.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, a couple of the Amazonians resemble members of 80\u2019s metal bands Anthrax (Dan Spitz and Joey Belladonna) and Manowar (Joey DeMaio). Seriously. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in Colon, Panama, which is about 800 miles north from where the events actually occurred.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-", "created_at": "2023-11-27T21:41:49.892Z"}]
