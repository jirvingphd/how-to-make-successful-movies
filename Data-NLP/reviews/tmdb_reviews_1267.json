[{"movie_id": 1267, "review_id": "5f34382310dad600352106ba", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "There's great potential there with the concept, but <em>'Meet the Robinsons'</em> feels convoluted and rushed.\r\n\r\nThe first hour of this is boring, once the (admittedly good) turn comes it does slightly improve. If you take out the main parts of this, you'll hold some good stuff - the message, the twist, the means are just some of them. Sadly, everything that surrounds the positive things set it back.\r\n\r\nThe cast aren't great either. It's cool to see a Disney film, especially from this era and before, give new voices a chance; rather than giving roles to the usual suspects. Unfortunately, none of this cast are memorable - at least to me. Matthew Josten has one or two funny bits as Goob, they could've done more with him.\r\n\r\nAnimation-wise it's largely fine, though a few moments haven't aged incredibly. The end song from Rob Thomas is nice. All in all, however, this isn't a film I can honestly say I enjoyed. I wouldn't be opposed to a remake, if they ironed the execution out.", "created_at": "2020-08-12T18:42:43.020Z"}]
