It reminds me a lot of a Hamaguchi in that it is a women-centric story about relationships. But the resemblance ends there. This is an epic film about the survival and meaning of friendship that has humor, pathos, drama and even a touch of magic surrealism. If anything I've mentioned is up your alley, then don't pass on this one.", "created_at": "2023-01-03T16:50:47.617Z"}]
