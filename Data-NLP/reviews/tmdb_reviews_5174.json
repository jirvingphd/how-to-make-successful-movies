His head is as big as Barry Bonds!\r\n\r\nAh look, as you have most likely heard by now, this is not as good as the first two films and it's just a little bit tired in formula. However, it's still a bunch of fun if you already buy into the fastest mouth/fastest hands pairing of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. The plot is incidental, thus simple, and the emphasis here is more on fun than electrifying action. Though the finale here is edge of the seat exciting and laugh inducing in equal measure. There's some truly good one liners thrown out and the chemistry between the two actors is still very much evident.\r\n\r\nUndemanding it is for sure, even disposable if it was to be judged as a single action/comedy entry, but it closes the trilogy down safe enough and the smile should rarely leave your face upon viewing. 6.5/10", "created_at": "2014-09-26T00:06:39.713Z"}, {"movie_id": 5174, "review_id": "5c43f5600e0a266d6bd2680e", "rating": 2.0, "review_text": "Arguably works as an example of the sort of red flags one might want to look out for if they suspect that a film's director is (like Brett Ratner) a sex offender.\r\n\r\nBut as a movie?
