No great shock there, it's an American Comedy in much the same vein as a great number of American Comedies that have come before it I didn't like. A lot of other people did like it. That's fine. Different strokes for different folks. All that jazz. I totally understand it. What I don't understand is the vast number of people who have said _\"This one's different. This movie is gonna appeal to the people who don't normally go in for this sort of thing. It breaks all the conventions and even Independent film & Oscar film fans will love it\"_. Like... No... When you follow up your piss-joke with the exact same piss-joke just seconds later... It's like... This is exactly the same as every other movie I hate.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605 - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._", "created_at": "2018-01-12T09:45:30.979Z"}, {"movie_id": 417870, "review_id": "6467f8afa5046e01474c7b8e", "rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Surprisingly funny! I thought this was going to be your regular running of the mill chick flick, far from it. Super hilarious and a really raunchy comedy.", "created_at": "2023-05-19T22:31:11.851Z"}]
