I thought this was going to be some awesome Sci-fi flick traveling through time and fighting to be with each other. (You know like all the other new Sci-fi flicks today). I was WRONG. Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman are both amazing actors, however I found the Fountain to be WAY TO artsy / independent film for me.", "created_at": "2014-02-06T05:35:04.718Z"}, {"movie_id": 1381, "review_id": "53184f15c3a3685c560011c2", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "A simple story told in a very complicated way.
