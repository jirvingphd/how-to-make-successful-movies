Wildly inappropriate for children, too crass and silly for adults. Obscure lore and reference only DC-familiars will pick up on, but also completely out of character moments and scenes that will never fly with that same crowd. Both is and isn't set in the cult-classic _Batman: The Animated Series_ Universe? Goes to the effort of getting DC voice alum Paget Brewster and the most famous Batman voice of all time, Kevin Conroy, but is stuck with Annoying-In-The-Wrong-Way Melissa Rauch to play Harley, who has never voiced the character before, and hopefully never will again.\r\n\r\nBut sadly, it's better than most animated superhero movies we're seeing these days.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._", "created_at": "2017-08-28T03:26:17.530Z"}]
