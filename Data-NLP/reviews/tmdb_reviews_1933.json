After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and there\u2019s a one-dimensional pale \u2018look\u2019 to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons. Speaking of which, the perpetually fog-laden grounds create a nice ghostly ambiance.\r\n\r\nEverything hinges on whether the last act effectively reveals the truth and it does. The film provides intriguing food for thought.               \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Cantabria, Spain (exteriors of the mansion); Penshurst, Kent, England (The Lime Walk) and Madrid. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-", "created_at": "2018-05-13T19:20:51.767Z"}]
