I caught a glimpse of the cast list before watching and it got me excited.\r\n\r\nMads Mikkelsen, naturally, but also seeing Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Eric Cantona and Jonathan Pryce attached raised my hopes. If I'm honest, I've seen better from all of them (aside from Cantona, who has barely two lines, as this is his first acting gig that I've seen, I'm more accustomed to his ability with the football as a Manchester United supporter - legend!). What they give is more than satisfactory, but I didn't feel like any of them were firing on all cylinders.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other issues like the (relatively minimal) special effects and the day/night lighting early on, but overall I'd class this as a positive viewing experience.", "created_at": "2023-10-17T00:43:30.752Z"}]
