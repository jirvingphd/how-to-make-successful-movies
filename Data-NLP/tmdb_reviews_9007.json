It's a well paced film at around 90 minutes, there are some decently amusing scenes in there alongside some more sombre ones - the majority of which come off rather well. Some parts are clich\u00e9, but not to the degree that it affected my enjoyment.\r\n\r\nOne that is well worth a watch, in my opinion of course.", "created_at": "2023-01-20T06:38:45.246Z"}]
