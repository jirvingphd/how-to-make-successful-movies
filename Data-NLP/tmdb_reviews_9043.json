This christmas based romantic comedy made me miss my own dysfunctional family. The Family Stone can be enjoyed by all. Luke Wilson was hilarious. Claire Danes looked great and Diane Keaton made this family. You'll laugh, You'll Cry, and you might want to call your Mom after watching this.", "created_at": "2014-02-06T05:27:06.556Z"}]
