Delivering his best performance as 007, Craig finishes his memorable run in a high-stakes film with some of the best action sequences of the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the practical sets and locations, stunt work, cinematography, and editing are all no short of impressive, working together beautifully to create magnificent set pieces.\r\n\r\nDespite an overlong runtime with an exposition-heavy second act and a terribly stereotyped villain with unclear motivations, the emotionally compelling narrative sets up a powerful third act boosted by an epic score.\r\n\r\nCary Joji Fukunaga brilliantly directs a movie packed with phenomenal performances that will leave no viewer indifferent. Massive praise to the outstanding ensemble cast.\r\n\r\nAnd a humble thank you to Craig\u2026 Daniel Craig.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "created_at": "2021-10-02T15:21:23.647Z"}, {"movie_id": 370172, "review_id": "6159165d51a64e00283f5cd0", "author_rating": 10.0, "review_text": "**A -{ _F I N A L E_ }- So Stunning, And Poetically GRANDIOSE \u2698 . . . . . . . . . . \" That You Will Simply -{ _N E V E R_\u00a0 }- See What's Coming \".**\r\n\r\nThis Is A **-_B I G_ -** Screen MINI Review ; Film Viewed On September 30, 2021, At \"VOX CINEMAS\" , UAE.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________ \r\n\r\nQ : \"Can I just have one nice evening please . . . . before the world explodes\". { Taken from one of the many -official - previews for No Time To Die; which I'll refer to as **\"_N.T.2.D_ \"** in this review }.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________ \r\n\r\n**1. \" The Overall Calibre Of Acting Here, Given That This -_Is_ - , At The End Of The Day , A -_Blockbuster Popcorn Flick_ - Is Well & Truly BREATHTAKING \" :** Spearheading -{ DAZZLING \ud83d\udc8e }- array of world-class talent in _N.T.2.D_ are : A : Hollywood veteran L\u00e9a Seydoux ...arguably best known for 'Blue Is The Warmest Colour' | 'Ghost Protocol' | 'Spectre' ...who plays the deeply damaged yet very independent, & ravishingly Lovely psychotherapist 'Madeleine Swann' ; rendering a delicate & impassioned performance that is nothing less than **MESMERIZING.** B : Rami Malik, a.k.a 'Lyutsifer Safin', the movie's -primary- ( of two ) \"Classic\" Megalomaniacal Bond-Villains, who unquestionably provides a most \"_DELECTABLY **IDIOSYNCRATIC** PORTRAYAL_ \" { on account of his having been ( -Very- ) badly scarred as a vulnerable, young boy ; as it is entirely incumbent on me to point out }.

Daniel Craig's run as Bond was solid overall, with some of the greatest films of the 80-year franchise and a couple that weren't amazing but still entertaining. But the conclusion to Craig's Bond was poorly written, out of character, and just plain disappointing. No Time to Die was The Last Jedi of James Bond. Long-time Bond fans will hate it, while those who are indifferent to the franchise or have not seen this entry will find it entertaining and possibly thoughtful. But I just don't see it. The writing was awful. The screenplay couldn't find better ways to motivate or shock than killing off characters that had been developed for over a decade. The idea of a new 007 was pitched as intriguing but hardly affected the story and sidelined Lashana Lynch's character altogether. The villains were generic, and their motivations inconsistent at best. And Bond's love for Madeleine didn't fit the character at all. He said and did things that Bond just wouldn't do. One shining moment in a film of disappointments was Ana de Armas as Paloma. Her performance was witty, engaging, and the most entertaining part of the movie. So, of course, she was only given 5 minutes of screen time. No Time to Die was clearly at a loss for what to do and failed to close this excellent chapter of James Bond history with nothing more than a mess of dreadful writing and unsatisfying conclusions.", "created_at": "2023-01-21T20:49:15.644Z"}, {"movie_id": 370172, "review_id": "643e1b63dd47160469d978c9", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Damsel in distress.\r\nExcept that's what makes this film stand out as different from other Bond movies. \r\nIt isn't a damsel in distress, but instead a child in jeopardy. 007 finds himself trying to protect the most innocent of creatures.\r\nAlong the way, he goes through some high octane action sequences. And he fights against a villain using genetic engineering in a weird and deadly way.\r\nHowever, the biggest problems here are \"predictability\" and \"horrible directing\".\r\nThe imagery is horrible. Even when there are exotic locales, there is not one cinematic second. It's all dull and tedious.\r\nThe classic 007 films of the Connery and Moore era had cinematic beauty with exotic locales. \r\nIn the era of Daniel Craig, this poor actor has to go through movies where the director can't even make imagery out of the most exotic locations.\r\nWhy even film on locations?
