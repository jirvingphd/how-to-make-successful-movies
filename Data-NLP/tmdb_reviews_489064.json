Well _3 From Hell_ is finally here and it's... a bit of a letdown. Not **bad**! But, after such a great second installment, and such a wait, just... a bit of a letdown. I absolutely adore Richard Brake but his inclusion apropos of nothing and Sid Haig's early removal due to his recent sad passing, felt almost... Disrespectful? I don't know. Expecting a Rob Zombie movie to be respectful sounds silly now that I see it written in front of me - I mean, he's got his wife wearing a feather headdress front and centre on the poster. (On that, I feel it's not altogether unlikely that Zombie included that attire specifically so that people would complain about it and he could counter with \"The character is already a serial killer, why are you looking for good behaviour from her, and why is her cultural appropriation the most offensive thing she's done to you?\" Which would be... you know... A fair point.) But I digress. _3 From Hell_ a little disappointing, probably not the sequel we would have gotten if there hadn't been a 14-year gap between the second and third entries, but still, pretty decent, a fun time, especially considering that after _House of_ the subsequent films have used gross murderers as the outright protagonists. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2019-12-28T11:18:29.758Z"}]
