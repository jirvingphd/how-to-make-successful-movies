I'll start with the positive parts. The animation is excellent, as is the music (nice song from Fall Out Boy). It also has a fair amount of heart, not as much as the film intends to add but still more than most.\r\n\r\nNow for the lesser things; that aren't bad per se, just not as well done in my opinion. The plot doesn't feel like anything too refreshing, I feel it's a story I've mostly seen elsewhere; in a few areas  it kinda reminded me of the sorta stuff you'd see in a Scooby Doo episode, at least in terms of the twists and/or antagonists. I, also, don't love the design for Baymax - making a character with no facial expressions or true emotion always makes it harder to get attached to them. I do like his purpose, mind.\r\n\r\nAs for the cast, they're decent just not memorable to me. Ryan Potter and Daniel Henney are solid as Hiro and Tadashi, I enjoy their bond together. I'm struggling to remember any of the others though.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a good film - it's just missing a couple of things that would've made it greater.", "created_at": "2020-09-01T18:19:20.462Z"}]
