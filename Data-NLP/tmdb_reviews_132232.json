If that wasn't the case, at least it looked like it. And she never seemed to fit that character well either. Javier Botet also deserves praise for the commitment and patience with which he put up with hours of make-up. The rest of the cast isn't so happy: Daniel Kash should have had more relevance in the plot, but we get the feeling that the character is dropped as quickly as possible, and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau wasn't used happily either, despite the talent and abilities of the actor.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has several points of merit that are worth watching carefully. This is the case with cinematography. The entire film was shot excellently, with careful and meticulous work from the cameras. The sharpness, the shadows, the lighting work and the dark and sometimes washed-out colors accentuate, in certain scenes, the atmosphere of tension and abandonment that can be felt by the audience. The visual effects work quite well, especially everything about the creature, which only loses interest when we can see it well. A good choice of sets and costumes also helped, and the CGI is elegant and satisfying until you reach the middle of the film, where it clearly loses quality and impact.", "created_at": "2022-08-01T03:07:17.157Z"}]
