And it was insanely bias from the start...\r\n\r\n...but most of the 1 Star reviews clearly didn't sit through it or even really watch it.\r\n\r\nIt makes the point that Hillary and the GOP ran on labeling all conservatives as Racist...and that was pretty true.\r\n\r\nIt makes a point that Hillary ran on gender politics that called all white males misogynist in a divisive way...also true.\r\n\r\nIt pointed out that the DNC has become anti-working class...and they are attacking anything that is pro-job creation, pro-job protection as Nationalist and Evil (to use the most appropriate words available) and that is also true.\r\n\r\nIt stated that Jackson founded the DNC, and that the DNC claims it is FDR...both are false. The DNC claims Jefferson as the founder.\r\n\r\nIt stated that the DNC was the party of slavery...fact.\r\n\r\nIt stated that the DNC was the party that advocated the Trail of Tears...also fact.\r\n\r\nIt stated that the GOP started in opposition to slavery...Fact.\r\n\r\nAnd the Civil Rights in the 186s WAS lead by the GOP. It's also a fact that more Republicans voted for the 1960s Civil Rights act than Dems. The same with Women's Suffrage.\r\n\r\nIt's not saying anything that is inaccurate. The issue is that it is saying accurate things from an insanely bias standpoint.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T03:41:15.580Z"}]
