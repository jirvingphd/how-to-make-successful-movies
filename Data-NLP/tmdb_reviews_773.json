A lot of women.\"\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nA family determined to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant take a cross-country trip in their VW bus.\r\n\r\nReview:\r\nLittle Miss Sunshine is a 2006 dramatic comedy that delivers all around. With solid cast that includes Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, Abigail Breslin, Steve Carrell an oscar winning performance by Allan Arkin and Bryan Cranston and Dean Norris in Albuquerque pre Breaking Bad and a great script Little Miss Sunshine is a film that I missed when it first came out but glad I got around to it.\r\n\r\nKinnear is the loser husband to Collette's Sheryl and Carell is her gay suicidal brother. Dano plays her quiet son and Arkin the heroine addicted dirty Grampa. Breslin's character Olive qualifies for the Little Miss Sunshine competition and it's a race to beat the clock as the family takes a road trip from Albuquerque to California filled with unexpected surprises and personal revelations.\r\n\r\nThe films ending solidifies the families bond and leaves us wanting to see hopefully another chapter in the families life down the road. No Pun intended. Little Miss Sunshine is defiantly worth checking out if you have not already or just a rewatch as a reminder of how good it is.", "created_at": "2019-11-17T07:06:55.584Z"}]
