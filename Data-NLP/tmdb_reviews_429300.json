I'm going to watch this again, in a few years from now, when I've forgotten the details. Highly recommended film. It's theme may not be one that lifts your mood, but still, watch it. You won't regret it, it restores faith in what we are able to pull through.", "created_at": "2021-05-29T17:20:18.194Z"}]
