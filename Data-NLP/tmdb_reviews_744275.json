The rather uninspiring, self-indulgent characterisations of \"Tess\" (Josephine Langford) and \"Hardin\" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) continue to vacillate from loving to loathing each other for reasons that continued to escape me after the first two films. The narrative reminded me of a visualisation of letters one might have written to a lonely hearts column - each problem being acted out on screen by the pair, before the scenario resets (for good or ill) and off we go again. To be fair, they are both quite easy on the eye, but their frequent, creatively photographed, sex scenes accompanied by some mediocre AOR soundtrack quickly start to wear thin. Perhaps I am just too old for this, but I just found their on/off relationship, their secret keeping about things that couldn't matter a jot to anyone, let alone to those who purport to \"love\" one and other, really boring. The truly stilted dialogue and delivery (especially from HFT, complete with a his unique set of \"letraset\" tattoos) ) contrive to make this a real dirge of a watch.
