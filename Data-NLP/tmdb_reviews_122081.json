If it just followed the compelling short description of the movie, instead of making that short description nearly EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE, it would be intriguing. This was the most tedious, redundant and gratuitous movie I've seen in a very long time. I expected the gratuitous ... it opened with an extended \"Girls Gone Wild\" sequence. But then it showed that sequence again, and again and again, then again, and again and again! This would be a \"one-star\" without James Franco. Once he is introduced you are captivated by his transformation into a wannabe gangsta rapper, especially given his tame, Disney-esque acting in \"Oz, the Great and Powerful.\" But then the tedious redundancy corrupted even his performance. The cinematography is interesting but with little plot and the unrelenting repetitiveness, even that became another irritant. If they removed all of the redundant scenes I think the movie would have been 30 minutes long.", "created_at": "2020-10-22T04:38:39.986Z"}]
