He's an excitable young man who finds himself torn between staying home and living the life his family want him to, and setting off and having some adventures of his own. It's the latter draw that prevails and after a trip to the museum with his friends, he is soon dealing with demons from within and without that challenge his very essence, his being - his soul, even. The story is steeped in history, in myth and in imagination and is colourfully and vividly delivered using a clever mix of dialogue, music and quite often just the richness of the imagery itself. Can this young man play games with those more experienced, malevolent, cunning and find the happiness he is looking for? Of course - there is jeopardy too - if he gets it wrong, then all humankind is going to suffer! There's even a gentle hint of a childish love triangle as the story builds to quite an entertaining - if predictable - denouement. It's a classy bit of cinema this, with plenty of strong characterisation, action, some darkness and just enough to keep the brain ticking over too. Cinema is best - it brings out the vivacity of the whole thing so much better.", "created_at": "2023-08-25T11:11:11.805Z"}, {"movie_id": 228326, "review_id": "64e88c4fe894a600c7286bcc", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "The big eyes and the slightly cardboard-box style of animation is really quite engaging as we follow the tale of \"Manolo\".
