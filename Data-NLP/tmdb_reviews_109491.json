He learns that they are \u201ccasters,\u201d immortals with magical powers; and that an evil relative (Emma Thompson) wants Lena for the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe director wrote the script based on the first of four young adult books of \u201cThe Caster Chronicles\u201d by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. Fans of the book, however, say it\u2019s one of the most unfaithful book-to-screen adaptions. Since I\u2019ve never read any of these books this was irrelevant to me.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the production as far as sets, costumes, cast, music goes. It cost $60 million and looks it. The Southern Gothic air is to die for and the first act is intriguing. Unfortunately, the tone is semi-campy where several of the characters are overly cartoonish. It\u2019s reminiscent of comic booky Stephen King flicks (e.g. \u201cSilver Bullet\u201d and \u201cNeedful Things\u201d), but a notch or two more exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe first half is also encumbered by an overtly anti-Christian slant. I don\u2019t have a problem with movies that depict the evils of fundamentalist legalism, like in \u201cThe Mist\u201d (2007), but here the stereotypes are so overdone they don\u2019t ring true, not to mention there\u2019s no positive depiction of believers to compare with the negative ones (like in \u201cThe Mist\u201d). According to this movie, ALL Christians are hateful, rash, judgmental, condemning bigots. Lazy writers love stereotypes because they don't have to write interesting complex characters.\r\n\r\nTake Lena\u2019s first day at school where two girls automatically assume she\u2019s \u201csatanic\u201d merely because she lives at the eerie plantation; they then proceed to openly pray for her. It\u2019s so overdone, cartoony and eye-rolling it takes the viewer right out of the movie. This doesn\u2019t even reflect reality in the modern world anyway: Even in a backwater town in the USA it\u2019s more likely that a devout Christian would be persecuted by mocking unbelievers and nominal Christians rather than vice versa. Another thoroughly unrealistic element is how all the top community leaders are ee-vil fundies who GO TO THE SAME CHURCH. Why Sure!\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the second half halfheartedly tries to make up for this by briefly revealing a more positive Christian character and having the pastor give a worthy mini-sermon on sacrifice, but it\u2019s too little too late after misrepresenting and offending half of the viewership.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is how the two protagonists suck face too much. The girl\u2019s only 15. I\u2019m not saying mid-teenagers don\u2019t make-out, but (again) it\u2019s so overdone it\u2019s eye-rolling.\r\n\r\nFor a better executed and entertaining fantasy/horror flick based on a young adult book series, check out \u201cCirque du Freak: The Vampire\u2019s Assistant\u201d (2009).\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 4 minutes and was shot entirely in Louisiana (Covington, Madisonville, Batchelor, St. Francisville and New Orleans).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C/C- (4.5/10)", "created_at": "2018-06-10T19:08:45.265Z"}, {"movie_id": 109491, "review_id": "644883426a222704a0d12ec3", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Another love story for a non mortal.
