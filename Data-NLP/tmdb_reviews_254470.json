I found the cast and music to be the big plus points to <em>'Pitch Perfect'</em>, though both of those things are off in this follow-up.\r\n\r\nAnna Kendrick (Beca) doesn't really do anything, at least very little that's even close to being memorable. Skylar Astin (Jesse) takes a back seat, which I don't actually think is a negative. Adam Devine (Bumper) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) aren't as amusing, though the story featuring those two probably did interest me most. Hailee Steinfeld, meanwhile, is an alright addition.\r\n\r\nNot a sequel I liked. Hopefully the third film improves upon this.", "created_at": "2021-03-11T00:31:53.826Z"}, {"movie_id": 254470, "review_id": "64c26bf4ede1b00102458d20", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Now it's senior year in college and the group gets kicked out of the competition.
