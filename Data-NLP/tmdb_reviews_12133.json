Reilly - two guys that will give you a really good belly laugh. Combine their powers and you\u2019re guaranteed a good time. So it is with _Step Brothers_ their 2008 collaboration. \r\n\r\n_Two aimless middle-aged losers still living at home are forced against their will to become roommates when their parents marry._\r\n\r\nTaking the slacker stereotype and turning it up to 11 there\u2019s a good time to be had with this film. The chemistry between Ferrell and Reilly is excellent and in the scenes where they are let loose with the ad libs the film hits top gear. There\u2019s some brilliant insults, a hilariously contrived situation, and in addition to the leads, the supporting cast are also all on point. \r\n\r\nThis one is a bit of a classic in the catalogues of Ferrell and Reilly, and is always worth a re-watch if you need a good laugh.", "created_at": "2020-07-10T08:18:13.538Z"}]
