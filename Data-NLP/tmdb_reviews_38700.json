With Michael Bay out of the director helm, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah deliver surprisingly good action sequences, considering this is their debut feature film. The formulaic, cliche, soap opera story is straight-up ridiculous at some points, and it carries such an aura of predictability that when it tries to introduce an emotional twist, it merely becomes absurd. The last shot feels like a call to Hollywood to make more sequels, which sort of ruins the whole \"Bad Boys one last time\" tagline\u2026 I'm extremely undecided on which side this review should fall, so I'll base my decision on the answer to the following question: \"Am I going to (want to) see this movie again or another sequel?\" Honestly\u2026 no.\r\n\r\nRating: C+", "created_at": "2020-01-16T17:14:04.073Z"}, {"movie_id": 38700, "review_id": "5e8bbac63e09f30012a33ee9", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "Another action packed movie for fans of  bad boys.", "created_at": "2020-04-06T23:27:02.169Z"}, {"movie_id": 38700, "review_id": "5f238db9caaca20036683f52", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "You know what you're getting.", "created_at": "2020-07-31T03:19:21.486Z"}, {"movie_id": 38700, "review_id": "61752bd5172d7f00455a6407", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "It was very fun and entertaining to watch.

IDK.\r\n\r\nI thought the first one was brilliant, and the second was an OK action/comedy but didn't have as many subtle spoofs, but still was a decent action movie.\r\n\r\nThis one, on the other hand I'd only give one star because I do an all or nothing thing... but it was better than Lethal Weapon 4 wasn't it? It was better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It was better than Coming Two America. It was better than most of the made it far too late where the original cast was far too old sequels that plague Hollywood like remakes.\r\n\r\nIt lacks the action fun that II had, it lacks the layers of humor that I had, Martin looks like he couldn't be bothered to get in shape... but it was a lot better, a LOT better, than like films.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I'll give it 10 stars because if Hollywood is going to make a sequel way too late for a sequel, this is sort of how you would want them to do it.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing I can say I really love about it, but there is also nothing I can say I hate about it, and for a sequel that should either have never been made or should have been made a decade earlier, it's not a bad film. And that sort of makes it great in today's everything is humorless and political era.", "created_at": "2023-01-11T00:30:07.967Z"}, {"movie_id": 38700, "review_id": "64441cd3651fcf02fb9d47d3", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Not as good as the others.
