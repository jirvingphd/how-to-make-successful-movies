[{"movie_id": 848685, "review_id": "641ebadb253fab00f3cc8439", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "\"Olga\" (Marina Fo\u00efs) and husband \"Antoine\" (Denis M\u00e9nochet) have recently located to a remote Spanish farming community where they are trying to make their living in as organic fashion as they can. Their neighbours, \"Xan\" (an excellent Luis Zahera) and \"Loren\" (Diego Anido) immediately take against them as they are determined to accept an offer from a wind turbine company that will see them realise some money from their land and offer an alternative to their otherwise pretty subsistence living. What now ensues is one of the finest examples of cinematographic intimidation I have ever seen. Director Rodrigo Sorogoyen allows the tension to build without providing a spark-point. The angry characterisation of the bully that is \"Xan\" simmers as former teacher \"Antoine\" tries almost everything to avoid losing his temper. When the pot does over-boil - as is inevitable - the story starts to falls away for me a bit and the last half hour, though poignant, increasingly lacked plausibility. The said, there is a palpable degree of nastiness portrayed here that is way more effective than any you will see in an horror film. The writing is clever and sharp and the exposure it offers us to just how communities can turn on each other when money rears it's ugly head makes this a remarkably effective character study of human nature and venality. Some fine cinematography helps to deliver a perfect scenario for this menacing drama that sees a competent cast knit well and present a truly scary story.", "created_at": "2023-03-25T09:11:55.078Z"}, {"movie_id": 848685, "review_id": "64653dad6905fb00fe642de8", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Living in a small town of retarded drunks who take a dislike to me for petty, subconscious reasons is probably my worst nightmare.
