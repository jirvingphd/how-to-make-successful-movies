It\u2019s an adequate addition in a messy franchise that never reaches the heights of the first two films but is just above the three films before it, and because of this a lot of people will like it much more than they should. It\u2019s not the \u2018Halloween\u2019 or even the \u2018X-Men: Days of Future Past\u2019 of the 'Terminator' franchise; it\u2019s a fine follow up, and sadly nothing more.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-terminator-dark-fate-say-hasta-la-vista-you-wont-want-to-be-back", "created_at": "2019-10-29T01:01:46.095Z"}, {"movie_id": 290859, "review_id": "5dc065fe7d2bc1001338b963", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the Terminator franchise, I share the same opinion as most people. The 1984\u2019s original became a cult classic, and it\u2019s one of the most influential sci-fi/action films of all-time. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the (very) few sequels to such a beloved movie that actually improves on its predecessor, standing as the number one film of the saga, quality- and entertainment-wise. James Cameron left the franchise, and suddenly it all went down the sewer. While Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is still tolerable, Salvation is absolutely terrible, and the reboot, Genisys, failed to change the saga\u2019s history compellingly. So, obviously, even with the return of Cameron to the production team, my expectations were moderately low.\r\n\r\nThat said, Dark Fate is the best Terminator installment since T2 \u2026 which is not saying much. The last two flicks have great casts (from Christian Bale to Emilia Clarke), but their scripts are baffling bad. This time around, the cast has amazing chemistry, and their characters have better dialogue, but it comes at a cost. The last three movies possess stories that are not as captivating or entertaining (or even rational) as the first two films. Dark Fate has a much better screenplay, but again it comes at a cost. What cost is this? Basically, it repeats the exact same bits as The Terminator.\r\n\r\nAn extremely thin line exists between paying homage to a movie and blatantly copying it. Tim Miller\u2019s team of screenwriters walk that line, stumbling to both sides several times along the way. Some scenes are indeed wonderful nods to the saga\u2019s first two installments, but a lot of other moments (too many, to be honest) are pretty much a copy-paste version of a significant plot point or character development arc from one of those films. In case you\u2019re wondering, this is the reason behind some of the \u201chate\u201d from both critics and fans all over the world. Nowadays, people are harsher with this sort of homages, and the previously mentioned line is getting thinner and thinner.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the divisive opinions is the opening sequence. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t spoil. They simply make a sudden and surprising narrative decision that takes some of T2\u2019s emotional impact, at least without first clarifying why they made such a call. Therefore, I gave the movie a chance to develop its idea, but it doesn\u2019t. It just goes with it, and it never returns to this initial moment. Having this in mind, I understand if people instantly decided to hate the film based on just that very first scene\u2026. Because it really doesn\u2019t have any justification besides \u201cwell, we need a story\u201d.\r\n\r\nDark Fate\u2019s screenplay is emotionally resonant, and it\u2019s also packed with (mostly) well-directed action sequences, but it resembles the 1984\u2019s original plot too much. There\u2019s even a direct line from Sarah Connor saying that a particular character is the equivalent of her son, John. This unnecessary and lazy exposition is surprisingly not as used as I expected it to be, but when it occurs, it\u2019s like they chose the lamest, silliest, worse possible moments to place it. However, I can\u2019t deny I actually had fun with the movie.\r\n\r\nWith a much better script than the last films, the cast was able to not only shine in a few scenes, but their incredible chemistry allowed for outstanding moments. Seeing Linda Hamilton portray Sarah Connor once again is a delight to my eyes, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is an awesome badass with hilarious lines. These two are phenomenal! Nevertheless, Mackenzie Davis steals the show as the enhanced soldier, Grace, especially regarding the action scenes. I don\u2019t think Natalia Reyes offered what her character needed since she\u2019s the protagonist, after all, but she\u2019s able to stand her ground. I did enjoy Gabriel Luna take on the Terminator Rev-9, but I wish he had a little bit of more screentime besides the action.\r\n\r\nTim Miller brings his talented directing chops from Deadpool and applies his action techniques to deliver a lot of entertaining sequences. The VFX team provides with some impeccable CGI, but there are a couple of shots concerning a few speed bursts that should have received better treatment.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Terminator: Dark Fate is the best Terminator installment since Judgment Day, but it still doesn\u2019t even reach the latter\u2019s heels. It boasts a fantastic cast, with Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to their respective iconic roles, but Mackenzie Davis outshines both with some badass moments and great acting. Natalia Reyes, as the protagonist, is disappointingly fine. Despite the action being well-directed and the screenplay being well-written, it all comes at the cost of essentially replicating the 1984 original\u2019s plot. Some homages are notable, but it\u2019s so identical story-wise that it takes away any sort of surprise, severely lacking creativity. In addition to this, it makes a narrative decision in the opening sequence that removes some of T2\u2019s emotional impact, damaging the saga\u2019s best movie and one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all-time. I don\u2019t exactly recommend it, but if you\u2019re a fan of the franchise, go see it but with moderate expectations.\r\n\r\nRating: C", "created_at": "2019-11-04T17:55:10.268Z"}, {"movie_id": 290859, "review_id": "5e2caa54c2823a001197bd25", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Pretty good (second) reboot for this long-running franchise with some decent action, respectable enough visual effects (some parts looked off, though) and I did genuinely liked the two new cast members while Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger were fine.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it's also pretty clear this is not a franchise that needed to have gone beyond the two movies (and I might give leniency to \"The Sara Connor Chronicles\"). The saving grace is that on the technical front, it was an entertaining popcorn flick but like Genysis (which I also liked tbh), not really sure when I would revisit. **3.5/5**", "created_at": "2020-01-25T20:51:32.752Z"}, {"movie_id": 290859, "review_id": "5e2f270f1685da0011e9c7da", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "\"For John.\"\r\n\r\n'Dark Fate' was meh. I mean it's basically the Force Awakens of the franchise just more cash grab. Like...how many times can they keep alternating T1 & T2, and yet it's astounding that it never ruins the legacy of the series. \r\n\r\nDespite all that, it's the third best in the series. At least this movie knows that Terminator is not for kids! I had some engagement in the movie, even through the reason being that it follows a familiar plot line.\r\n\r\nLinda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are both the stand outs. Hamilton playing a cranky bad-ass and Arnold playing an involved machine that has a life of his own. Mackenzie Davis was surprisingly not as annoying as I thought she will be just from the marketing alone. Her character was straight forward in terms of motivation and can take damage.\r\n\r\nTim Miller really knows how to direct action scenes effectively and in this movie he delivers some grand action set pieces. However, after seeing the movie a few days ago, only a small selection stick to memory.\r\n\r\nGabriel Luna did a decent job playing the new advance Terminator. They took the \"Robert Patrick\" approach with picking an ordinary looking guy and making him into the biggest threat of humanity. Although it was a bit hard for me to feel threaten by him as throughout the movie he seemed easily out match by pretty much everyone. \r\n\r\nI didn't really buy into Dani played by Natalia Reyes as the main \"saviour of the future\", mainly because of her stiff acting and everytime she holds a gun it's twice her size.\r\n\r\nThe visual effects at times looked pretty OK, but the rest looked really bad. It really doesn't help when there's close ups on the effects where you can see the fakeness. At times the movie was a little too dark and I don't mean in tone, just whenever it's night time.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Not as great as T1 & T2, but nothing will without James Cameron magic touch.", "created_at": "2020-01-27T18:08:15.622Z"}, {"movie_id": 290859, "review_id": "5ec37fd918b7510020ca6a41", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Let it never be said that they aren't trying.

Plus there is a weird parallel there where they still need a \"big strong man\" to save them, but it's a machines, so the only man a woman really needs is a \"machine\"?  I don't know, I really liked the movie, and I sure wouldn't change the cast, just maybe point it in a more linear direction than the \"protect the womb\" mislead they threw in to throw shade at the original.\r\n\r\nLinda Hamilton is just as bad ass as ever, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is really keeping up too.  I love Mackenzie Davis in this: she plays a no-nonsense, dedicated soldier so well.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Natalia Reyes just doesn't sell the character she's supposed to be to me, and Gabriel Luna doesn't quite pop for some reason.  Granted the T-1000 has some surprise and charm to it that the REV-9 doesn't quite have just in the nature of it.\r\n\r\nI will say the REV-9 does bring a very specific flavor to the action, being 1, 1.5, or even 2 separate characters really has a lot of potential to it, and I do want to see a different story that does intelligence work with a similar concept, but the action this gives is pretty sweet.\r\n\r\nAnd that's where it is special, mostly in the nano-bot effects.  Most of the rest of the action is pretty standard, but good, and Mackenzie Davis does such a great job playing up being super powered against such a crazy machine.
