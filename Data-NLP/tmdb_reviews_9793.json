This time our nocturnal nuclear survivors manage to - quite successfully - prey on a platoon of trainee National Guard. It would appear that their finely hones military skills are no match of the their hungry opponents as they are gradually whittled down - even their own guns are turned against them as someone manages to somehow crawl out of a portable toilet! The dialogue is banal and the director Martin Weisz has managed to assemble quite possibly the least capable cast of acting talent I have seen since \"Mesa of Lost Women\" (1953). The photography is good; we do get up close and personal with the frequently quite brutal action, but it appears that another side effect of surviving a mushroom cloud is a seeming invincibility when shot in the head at 5 paces - which after a while becomes really quite dull to watch. Wes Craven still had a hand in this, but I'm sure even he would look at it now and wonder what was he thinking!", "created_at": "2022-04-23T18:30:58.571Z"}]
