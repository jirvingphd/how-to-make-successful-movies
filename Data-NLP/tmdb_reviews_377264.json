So the question is put forth to **Morgan** first-time director Luke Scott as he oversees this kinetic but overly familiar choppy and saggy sci-fi horror-thriller.  Of course Luke is the son of famed _Alien_ and _Blade Runner_ movie mastermind Ridley Scott\u2013the co-producer of his offspring\u2019s muddled and mediocre futuristic feature.\r\n\r\nSure, the young Scott incorporates some of the elder Scott\u2019s cinematic flourishes but for the most part **Morgan** toys around with interesting philosophical concepts and perceptions but fails to make any of these adventurous ingredients gel with any lingering forethought beyond the identity of a probing and generic genetics-oriented melodrama.\r\n\r\nIndeed, **Morgan** has its moments of energetic lapses but the tension is telegraphed from miles away. There is something superficial about the manufactured dilemma in **Morgan** that simply misses the mark in mustering any legitimate skepticism about artificial intelligent ingenues gone roguish. The continued genre of artificial human beings\u2013male or female\u2013seems like a fascinating fable to tap into the mind of humanistic arrogance and progression. With past showcases as Michael Crichton\u2019s _Westworld_ or Steven Spielberg\u2019s _A.I._ one can see the preoccupation with revisiting this film phenom topic especially in the age of millennium movie-making. Unfortunately, the arrival of the mediocre **Morgan** does not quite follow a glorious path in this cinematic tradition.\r\n\r\nThe center of attention in this lucrative experimentation of artificial life forms involves a \u201cgirl\u201d named Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy). The construction of Morgan is quite ambitious as she is composed of synthetic DNA while placed physically in the body of a wild-child acting teenager. Morgan has the mentality (and physicality) of 5-year old lab-grown specimen kid and we get to check out her so-called psychological malfunctioning when she aggressively attacks Dr. Kathy Grieff (Academy Award nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh, \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d) in her claustrophobic room. When Morgan tragically stabs Dr. Grieff in the eyeball we are bluntly hit over the head with the brutal hinting that this little hoodie-wearing dangerous diva is a walking disastrous time-bomb waiting to happen among the opportunistic human lab technician capitalists that invented her caustic existence.\r\n\r\nEnter Lee Weathers (Kate Mara). Corporate risk analyst consultant Lee is sent by her profitable employer to the remote testing lab where Morgan was conceived to obviously oversee their expensive investment in the artificially crafted feminine pet project that now is showing telling signs of defiance and disobedience. The uncontrollable Morgan is an unhinged handful to contain and the lab staff at the facility are scattering about to contain the selective damage done by her destructive hands. In general, the massive and deep-wooded compound that houses Morgan and the various doctors, lab techs, researchers and business associates that come in unison for the sake of human technological tampering is a sinister setting to say the least.\r\n\r\nMorgan is downright deadly and not a techno-tart to tangle with at will. As Dr. Kathy continues to nurse her severe eye-related wounds inflicted by the haunting human-like honeybun with indescribable speed and strength the other facility caretakers realize that the brooding Morgan may in fact be too much to handle for the self-appointed brilliant scientific minds that gave her questionable life. Among the brainy bunch that are trying to lasso the unpredictable tiny terror is Morgan\u2019s main creator in the Nervous Ned-like persona of geeky Dr. Simon Ziegler (Toby Jones). Dr. Lui Cheng (Michelle Yeoh from \u201cMechanic: Resurrection\u201d) is not new to the controversial rodeo where humanoid experimentation is concerned (resulting in Lui\u2019s former colleague\u2019s tragic fates). Married doctors in Brenda and Darren Finch (Vinette Robinson and Chris Sullivan) hold some glossy parental fondness for the hostile teen-experiment-in-turmoil. Dr. Amy Menser (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star Rose Leslie) has eerily taken some head-scratching \u201cfancy\u201d to the youthful Morgan that goes beyond inappropriate means. Rounding out the colorful group that cater to the facility functioning (and Morgan\u2019s every step of chaos) is Lee\u2019s tour guide Ted (Michael Yare) and cooking guru Skip Vronsky (Boyd Holbrook).\r\n\r\n**Morgan** has some tension-filled wallop that resonates occasionally but the draggy drama never quite stimulates to the point of presenting Taylor-Joy\u2019s lab-table vixen as nothing more that a brutish brat with a temper. The thought of Taylor-Joy\u2019s minor-aged monster being unleashed on an unsuspecting world must have looked intriguing on the creative drawing board. However, being a pesky thorn in the side of misguided scientific minds does not exactly spell tasty devastation on society as a whole. In fact, we find ourselves cheering for the maligned Morgan to knock off these myopic medical duds to get some guilty pleasure relief from this lethal but lumbering horror sideshow.\r\n\r\nOwens\u2019s labored script is never challenging enough to buy into the cynicism of the profitable propaganda involving artificial intelligence at the expense of human curiosities.** Morgan** routinely dips into the blank coldness of hollow despair with only Taylor-Joy\u2019s random naughtiness as the reliant stimulant. Mara\u2019s Lee Weathers is surprisingly effective as the truth-seeking corporate drone out to uncover the mysteries of Morgan and the pricey lab compound that needs to prove its usefulness to her inquiring organization. Paul Giamatti pops up as the only sensible soul diagnosing the unwound Morgan as a potential toxic teen to the world environment.\r\n\r\nThere is some slickness and saucy sentiments to the uneven **Morgan** but it channels nothing dynamically distinctive from other considerable fare that competently tapped into this theme with more profoundly in-depth pizzazz and promise. Morgan may be a super-powered enigma and the hard-nosed Lee Weathers wants this frenzied freak show deactivated and put out of her misery. This is rather funny because the true troubleshooters that need deactivation are the **Morgan**-made manipulators (both on screen and off screen) that should return to the lukewarm lab room.\r\n\r\n**Morgan** (2016)\r\n\r\nScott Free Films\r\n\r\n1 hr. 32 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Kate Mara, Anya Taylor-Joy, Toby Jones, Rose Leslie, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Giamatti, Michelle Yeoh, Rose Leslie, Vinette Robinson, Chris Sullivan, Boyd Holbrook, Michael Yare\r\n\r\nDirected by: Luke Scott\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror & Science Fiction/Fantasy & Technology/Artificial Intelligence Drama\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016", "created_at": "2016-09-04T07:11:23.184Z"}, {"movie_id": 377264, "review_id": "582b6305c3a368360b04bc77", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "\"Alex Garland\u2019s 2015 cult hit Ex Machina, with Alicia Vikander as the robo-girl, trod similar ground; it proved more intellectually ambitious, though Morgan is a dash more fun...\"\r\n\r\nRead the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2016/11/16/morgan.html", "created_at": "2016-11-15T19:33:25.017Z"}, {"movie_id": 377264, "review_id": "5851b92292514146c900945d", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "**Knowing it's a research, the mistake is emotionally attached to the subject!**\r\n\r\nA nicely made sci-fi-thriller, but the entire storyline was built on a very familiar plot. You can find it similarities with 'Splice', 'Uncanny' and 'Ex Machina', but I think overall not a bad attempt. I did not get impressed, so do most of the people who saw those films, especially the end scene. Though it is entertaining, particularly when it turns into an action mode.\r\n\r\nThe corporate that invested in a research sends an investigator named Lee after the project was met with a small accident. During an interview, the chaos unleashes and the lab started to fall apart. The survivours does not know who to trust, but decides to save their subject. What really follows after that will be totally unexpected and another twist before the final credits.\r\n\r\nKnowing it's a research, the mistake is emotionally attached to the subject. That's what all the similar topic films reveal. Then what's the point of doing such test, being doctor, studied psychology. For a film plot, they wanted to use the human sentiments and errors. Otherwise, science does not really deal like what was shown in this film.\r\n\r\nFrom a new director, with the decent actors, particularly Kate Mara's best in an action avatar. I liked the Anya in the film 'The Witch' and this is another good performance by her in the title role. Felt like it is a short film, because the pace was so good, even though the story was a one-liner. Minimal cast film and takes place in a remote place secret research lab. A film not for everyone, but not bad for once viewing.\r\n\r\n_5/10_", "created_at": "2016-12-14T21:26:58.846Z"}, {"movie_id": 377264, "review_id": "58a50f73c3a3684ef8001f67", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "While critically reviled, I found this to be a taut, tense genre exercise driven by a superb performance from Anya Taylor-Joy.", "created_at": "2017-02-16T02:33:23.808Z"}, {"movie_id": 377264, "review_id": "5b1471e30e0a262dcc003ace", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "Morgan is a great Science Fiction movie.
