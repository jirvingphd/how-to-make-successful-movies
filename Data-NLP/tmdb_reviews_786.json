While outskirt performances from Frances McDormand (brilliant as William's fretful mother), Anna Paquin, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as the legendary Lester Bangs) and Fairuza Balk, consistently hit the hi-hat. The music of course rocks, from metal and progers, to folkers and bubblegum, to some punk godfathery, these sounds feature on the soundtrack and kick the decade into orbit - while the Stillwater scenes are effective and the use of Elton John's Tiny Dancer will land in your heart and stay there.\r\n\r\nCameron Crowe has created a smashingly memorable film that will stand the tests of time. Two cuts are available, where both the theatrical and director's cuts are sure fire things (the latter Bootleg Cut my personal favourite). This is a music based film to sit with the best of them, God Bless Rock N Roll and God Bless Cameron Crowe, for he could have easily embellished and over egged his rock pudding, instead he kept it real. 9/10", "created_at": "2015-07-13T23:06:18.283Z"}, {"movie_id": 786, "review_id": "60e8ad6a4d67910046bb6f3c", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "With the new 4K release, decided to watch the Director's Cut (Untitled) version for the first time having seen the theatrical version a couple of times over the years (last time was several years ago, however). Anyway, still a great movie even for someone who isn't exactly steeped into rock and roll music. Features a wonderful ensemble cast with solid performances all around (Hudson and Crudup were standouts) and the original music, alongside the classics, were great. **4.5/5**", "created_at": "2021-07-09T20:11:22.337Z"}, {"movie_id": 786, "review_id": "6240cbefc616ac005b00bf88", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "_**Misadventures while touring America with an up-and-coming band in the early 70s**_\r\n\r\nA 15 year-old aspiring rock journalist (Patrick Fugit) gets a gig by Rolling Stone to tour America with the rising group Stillwater in 1973. He develops a relationship with a winsome groupie of the band (Kate Hudson) while learning the group dynamics behind the music, such as the rivalry between the guitarist and lead singer (Billy Crudup and Jason Lee).\r\n \r\n\"Almost Famous\" (2000) was written/directed by Cameron Crowe, known for movies like \u201cJerry McGuire\u201d (1996) and \u201cSay Anything\u201d (1989). It\u2019s a behind-the-scenes rock-oriented flick in the mold of \u201cThe Rose\u201d (1979), \u201cOh, God! You Devil\u201d (1984), \u201cRock Star\u201d (2001) and \u201cThe Perfect Age of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u201d (2009).\r\n \r\nThe story is semi-biographical, inspired by Crowe\u2019s experiences writing for Rolling Stone at 15 and touring with the Allman Brothers at 16. The amusing plane sequence was drawn from a real-life situation with The Who; and the guitarist of the band, Russell, is based on Glenn Frey of Eagles.\r\n\r\nI had heard the critical gushing, but wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like it for much of the first half, yet it won me over with the second half. The aforementioned plane sequence is a highlight. For a more serious, darker take on similar material see the obscure \u201cThe Perfect Age of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll,\u201d which I favor over this one.\r\n\r\nThe notable cast also includes Frances McDormand as the boy\u2019s conservative mother, Zooey Deschanel as his sis and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a wise rock journalist. Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin and Bijou Phillips are also on hand as groupies. While Anna\u2019s role is small, she stands out on the feminine front, along with star Kate.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in California, Arizona and Manhattan (Gramercy Park Hotel and Central Park).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "created_at": "2022-03-27T20:41:19.835Z"}, {"movie_id": 786, "review_id": "63bf61efe16e5a0092b33a10", "author_rating": 10.0, "review_text": "You see a lot of people here calling this one of their favorite movies. It's certainly one of mine. But, twenty years after I've found myself wondering if it's the movie that I like or if it's the music.\r\n\r\nI mean, it references Lester bangs, and he is played by Hoffman. And it is a Crowe film. But it's about Rolling Stone when Rolling Stone was important and not the hallow shadow of it's former self.\r\n\r\nAnd with that tale about Rolling Stone's former glory it tells the story about Rock and Roll before it caved into New Wave, Disco, and was finally washed away with the auto-tune and drum machine bubblegum pop that needs a mass burning in Soldier Field in the near future.\r\n\r\nBut look at the sound track, Simon and Garfunkle, The Who, Iggy Pop, Black Sabbath, Rod Stewart, The Allman Brothers, The Seeds, Fleetwood Mac, everyone's favorite Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Cat Stevens, and my favorite Elton John song.\r\n\r\nAnd those are just the highlights. But, that is a playlist, that is an record collection. Most everyone has an album by one of those bands.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, Still Water is a place savor for the Allman Brothers and in some cases it's so obvious it hurts.\r\n\r\nSo, is it one of my favorite films? Twenty years on do I really love this film or do I love the soundtrack? Do I love the era it portrays when Rock was still relevant and the Rolling Stone still meant something?\r\n\r\nHonestly I don't know... because, at the end of the day, I do really love this movie. I mean, Frances McDormand is in it... but honestly, I think I just love the music a little more.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I am Gen-X, I grew up with Pearl Jam and Nirvana and Green Day. I grew up with grunge and punk and I thank God every day that I turn on the radio that I had worthy bands to follow and record stores were still a part of my life.\r\n\r\nI'd hate to be my wife's age. I'd hate to be a Millennial. I'd hate to be Gen-Z... but a big part of me would have loved to be a Boomer, would have loved to be my father's age, even with all the problems, just because they got experience all that music when it was still new, still fresh, and the musicians were still in their prime and preforming at the top of their games.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, I love the movie but I like the music a heck of a lot more.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T01:27:11.351Z"}, {"movie_id": 786, "review_id": "64e06131aaec7103fcfdf9a6", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "It was a tough day, but after watching the movie, it was exhilarating.
