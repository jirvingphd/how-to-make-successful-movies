Going into it, I had pretty low expectations as it seemed to be a cheap, action flick that was built for the dad's in our life. But there were some pretty good performances, set pieces, and brutal action that raised this movie from mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe plot is incredibly bare bones: a plane gets damaged in a storm and crash lands on a desolate island. We've seen this used in countless films and TV shows throughout the years but, the way this is handled is pretty incredible. We see it from the pilots perspective as he and the stewards are trying to navigate the situation to create the best course of action to survive. It was done in a very believable way, giving us a glimpse at crash landing procedure and how truly indestructible planes are. The entire 30-minutes sequence had me on the edge of my seat even though I knew it was coming from a mile away. The CGI in this section was quite rough though as the plane looked like something rendered in an Xbox 360 game.\r\n\r\nThe movie does fall into some pretty classic tropes in movies like this. One being that almost all the \"good\" people are the classic white American men and woman, but the \"bad\" people (the island combatants and our main prisoner hero) are individuals of color. It is subtle, but something I noticed that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Also the depiction of how the Philippines refused to assist in their own territory was laughable. But it opened the way for the good men of the American military were there to save the day and kill some island terrorists. It has some minor military propaganda that didn't totally take away from my experience, but worth a mention. \r\n\r\nThe performances were all pretty good. Gerard Butler played his usual role, I enjoyed his charisma as a pilot but also the gruff and militaristic persona he pulled out from his previous service. Mike Colter was great as the ultimate badass of the movie, killing terrorists with whatever he could get his hands on. This was nothing against his performance, but I hated how they wrote his characters ending in the film. It did not do his character arch any justice and felt out of place. The rest of the cast was decent.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie delivers exactly what it promised in a short concise runtime and I cannot ask any more than that.\r\n\r\nScore: 63%\r\nVerdict: Decent", "created_at": "2023-02-01T19:40:42.532Z"}, {"movie_id": 646389, "review_id": "63e3e1b17304b500c9f5ffac", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "May contain an odd spoiler \r\n\r\n\u201cPlane\u201d has a Scottish Pilot, Brodie Torrance ( Gerard Butler ) intent on getting his passengers to their destination in time to meet up with his daughter during the New Year festivities. However all does not go to plan when bad weather puts paid to any such activities and prematurely forces Brodie to make an emergency landing. During the attempt to land an FBI agent escorting a dangerous criminal, Louis Gaspare ( Mike Colter ), drops his mobile phone. Rather than leave it during a dangerous decent he tries to retrieve it only to loose both his life and that of a stewardess trying to help him.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSurviving this landing on a remote island was not easy but the skills of Brodie saves the remaining passengers and crew. However far from praised for his actions the passengers decide it\u2019s rather an inconvenience and complain constantly as the crew try to repair the communications. Unfortunately there is much more for the passengers to complain about once they are taken hostage by rebel forces who control the Island. More deaths ensue, however Brodie and his new friend, Louis are the only two to avoid capture after killing a few rebels along the way. Brodie and Louis work together to dispatch more rebels in an attempt to rescue the hostages.\r\n\r\nWhat ensues is a Die Hard style action thriller but based at New Year rather than Christmas. \u201cPlane\u201d does have some tense moments but very much ticks every Die Hard trope box it can. What is extremely notable, much like Die Hard, a rather large number of rebels are killed compared to hostages. In hindsight, as requested by Brodie, if I was Hans Gruber , sorry the rebel leader, I\u2019d have let all the hostages go. I did enjoy this movie but for what it is, an action packed, nothing new , 1 hour 47 mins.\r\n\r\nNew tag line .

He does these things so much better! Maybe he was off having an haircut so they decided to cast a distinctly wooden Gerard Butler as airline captain \"Torrance\" who is charged with flying his plane from Singapore to Tokyo before he heads on to his daughter's wedding in the USA. There aren't many passengers on his airliner, so to save cash and fuel he is directed to fly very near a violent storm that - well, next thing he has managed to land his sizeable aeroplane on a remote and lawless Filipino island (that luckily is replete with a dirt-track \"mining\" road that would not look out of place encircling Los Angeles). Now we happen to know that one of his few charges was also under the charge of the police, and now \"Brodie\" and the erstwhile captive - and useful - \"Gaspare\" (Mike Colter) must unite to fend off the venal bandits lead by their chief \"Junmar\" (Evan Dane Taylor) whilst getting a message to the rescue parties that can hopefully come and save their bacon. This film is so far-fetched that you might as well leave any need for reality at the door as you go in. The dialogue is pedestrian and the plot lurches from one implausibly half-baked scenario to another with consummate ease. That said, it hots up nicely for the last twenty minutes of gunfighting and that does rescue it a little from the mediocrity it probably deserves. It passed an hour and an half in the cinema easily enough, but it is not a film you will ever remember watching.", "created_at": "2023-02-09T09:32:30.913Z"}, {"movie_id": 646389, "review_id": "63e70b7b6c84920097fe96e2", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "**Plane is a well-done action thriller with a solid lead and good fight sequences. Nothing more. Nothing less.**\r\n\r\nPlane is a low-budget action/survival movie that checks all the boxes and provides plenty of gritty Gun fights and brutal melee combat along the way. The film that didn\u2019t spend much time picking a clever name also didn\u2019t waste much time on character development. Instead, the plot is centered on Gerard Butler as he works to secure the safety and survival of a small group of passengers.

When you watch the movie, you feel that it is a film in the early 2000s, and this makes you feel that you need to watch this type of movies from time to time. The movie managed to grab my attention because there is a factor of isolation. Isolation in the air while boarding the plane and the problems that occurred during take-off and after landing on the ground, which is the isolation of staying on the island.\r\n\r\nImagine you land the plane in an area controlled by separatists and the killers are people who don't follow the law. This movie has become a kind of survival, which is the struggle for survival, and these movies have a large type of viewers, regardless of the usual plot and the familiar and expected ending.\r\n\r\nIf i am from the kind of audience whose movies only depend on the plot, I will criticize the movie from beginning to end, but there are sometimes movies that you should watch for fun, like Plane 2023. Cinema is the art of conversation, but it is also an enjoyable experience. Each movie has a specific goal for viewers.
