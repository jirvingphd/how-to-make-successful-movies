Tim Roth\u2019s nameless soldier-of-fortune with inscrutable motivations. The rent-a-thug Steve (The RZA), who is nothing if not pragmatic. The lowlights: a terrible script that tries too hard to shoehorn a hardcore action plot into a film that works well enough without it. It\u2019s readily apparent why this movie didn\u2019t get a wider theatrical release.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed seeing it, but ask me a month from now and I\u2019ll barely remember it.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**", "created_at": "2016-07-30T19:12:40.851Z"}, {"movie_id": 333385, "review_id": "5f1cb65166a7c30038049538", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nThis has a very special recipe of madness to it, I honestly don't know how to tell you how this movie FEELS.  Sam Rockwell has a very particular style of acting to begin with, and telling him to turn it up to eleven turns out amazingly.  Anna Kendrick, better know for \"I'm a teen girl\" acting than intense action roles keeps every pace with Rockwell in both action and madness.\r\n\r\nWhile we get whiplash from how likeable Kendrick's character is before Rockwell comes in, the fun of the movie quickly takes off in both action and writing.  As \"Mr. Right\" carries chaos in his wake, it starts to develop multi-threading between the two characters, and while Rockwell is the main focus for majority of the movie, I think it is equal part leads between the two.\r\n\r\nThere is some funny business in the 3rd act as they do some things that would normally be 1st act establishing events, but one becomes a mini-arc of the 3rd act, and the other just isn't explained at all, unless I misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe only other movie that is even close to this is \"Wanted\", and that's pretty superficial, the higher philosophical points aren't presented in the same manner at all, the movies \"feel\" completely differently, but they both focus on the morality of killing and high reflexes.\r\n\r\nDefinitely give this one a go if you like action movies, it's a lot of fun.", "created_at": "2020-07-25T22:46:41.926Z"}, {"movie_id": 333385, "review_id": "610f036a38469a00452c0c5f", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "Okay, so Mr. Right is a different sort of romantic comedy! It starts with an original idea: a hit man undergoes a personality change due to an injury, so that instead of carrying out hit jobs like previously, he decides that \u201cmurder is wrong \u201c and so, not seeing the obvious irony, he kills those who order the hits.\r\n\r\nWe also meet Martha, a single gal coming off a bad break-up (isn\u2019t everyone at the start of these movies?) and the two of them gradually make a connection. Against all odds, it seems, given his mental state, he treats her quite well. Their banter is witty and intelligent, with some humor coming from him telling her exactly what he does \u2014 kill people \u2014 and she naturally thinks he is kidding. She has her own surprises for us later, but I will give nothing away here.\r\n\r\nAs I have noticed with a few other movies lately \u2014 mostly action films, such as Nobody \u2014 there is a ridiculous amount of violence here, almost cartoonish at times. I invented a new genre for them :Bodybag movies. I guess if some viewers require such excesses, who am I to complain? I enjoyed this movie anyway. I like that he is always polite and considerate to his new girlfriend even under extreme and dangerous situations. And you know how it is neat when characters display personal growth? The surprises that emerge concerning Martha that I alluded to above are part of a rather astonishing bit of character growth for her. Or is \u2018growth\u2019 the wrong word?. But no, my lips are sealed. Watch this entertaining comedy and see for yourself.", "created_at": "2021-08-07T22:04:26.660Z"}]
