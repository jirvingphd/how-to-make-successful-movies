[{"movie_id": 14438, "review_id": "6307aacab042280082ea3fab", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "I think Catherine Holt (Erin Bethea) sums up very well what\u2019s wrong with her marriage to Caleb (Kirk Cameron): \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to work every day and get the groceries while you look at trash on the Internet dreaming about your boat.\u201d \r\n\r\nShe has a point, or rather two. According to her, Caleb \u201ctuck[s] away a third of [his] salary saving for a boat we don\u2019t need. [He has] $24,000 in savings when things in our house need fixing.\" \r\n\r\nYou can\u2019t argue with that; having a boat is after all a single guy kind of thing to do. I don\u2019t need to tell the movie this \u2013 what with it being a \"faith-based\u201d drama \u2013, but \u201cNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d In other words, ye cannot have a wife and a boat.\r\n\r\nAs for the \u201ctrash\u201d that Caleb is so fond of \u2013 i.e., porn \u2013, I could see a way to work that into a marriage, but then both parties would have to be on board, and that\u2019s precisely the problem with this movie. \r\n\r\nTo help him save his marriage, Caleb\u2019s father John (Harris Malcom) presents him with \u201cThe Love Dare;\u201d a 40-day program that goes something like this: \u201cDay one: \u2026 For the next day resolve to say nothing negative to your spouse at all. If the temptation arises, choose not to say anything \u2026 Day two: \u2026 In addition to saying nothing negative to your spouse today, do at least one unexpected gesture as an act of kindness,\u201d and so on and so forth (on the 16th day he has to pray for her; in the movie\u2019s funniest line, Caleb confesses \u201cI kind of skipped that one.\u201d This obviously happens before he relents and accepts Jesus Christ into his heart). \r\n\r\nCatherine takes her husband\u2019s newfound attentiveness with a grain of salt (her friends advise her that \u201cHe\u2019s trying to butter you up for a divorce,\u201d whatever that means). \r\n\r\nCaleb calls his father and complains that \u201cNone of this means anything to her,\u201d and he\u2019s right, but how could it be any other way? How can something she doesn\u2019t even know is going on mean anything to her? \r\n\r\nOddly, when John talks about his experience with the Love Dare, he speaks in plural \u2013 e.g., \u201cThere was a point when we had no hope either\u201d \u2013; unless he\u2019s using the royal \u2018We,\u2019 he means himself and Caleb\u2019s mother. Caleb, on the other hand, hides the whole thing from Catherine, which a) doesn\u2019t seem like the best way to go about repairing your marriage and b) wouldn\u2019t it work better if it were a two-sided effort? It\u2019s not like she\u2019s completely blameless, either. \r\n\r\nAnd now to give the Devil, or I guess Jesus, his due. Caleb is a firefighter, and he and his crew are called to the scene of a traffic accident. A woman is trapped inside the wrecked vehicle, which in turn is sitting on some tracks right on the path of an oncoming train. They are \u201ccurrently unable to make contact with the train dispatcher,\u201d so Caleb & Co. have no choice but to manfully push the car out of harm\u2019s way.\r\n\r\nThis is all kinds of great. Not only does it put to shame many a newer, much more expensive film (is it an actual train? I\u2019m not going to go out on a limb that it is, but if it\u2019s CGI, then it\u2019s the best damn CGI train I\u2019ve ever seen), but it makes me care about the characters because I can believe they truly are firefighters putting their lives on the line \u2013 quite literally, in this case. \r\n\r\nNow, if only the movie had been about firefighting instead of a loveless marriage that avoids ending up in divorce thanks to a little m\u00e9nage \u00e0 dieu.", "created_at": "2022-08-25T17:00:58.901Z"}]
