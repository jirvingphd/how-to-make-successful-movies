Still, some interesting elements, the ghosts' designs, when you can appreciate them, have an almost Hellraiser-like quality to them, and never a bad thing having Tony Shalhoub in the lead even when I didn't once buy into the family dynamic.\r\n\r\nHas the hallmarks of a a film from that era, with the direction (and camera angles) plus the inclusions of Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie franchise) and Matthew Lillard (Scream franchise) in there. Also, the twist at the end didn't make a lick of sense. That said, can't say I was ever bored and honestly, if anyone actually remembered this movie, the setting would make for a fun scare house (and using special glasses to see the entities) somewhere like at the Universal Horror Nights or w/e it's called.\r\n\r\n**2.75/5**", "created_at": "2020-07-06T21:20:50.227Z"}, {"movie_id": 9378, "review_id": "64c7c227d6c300010175dc8a", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Pretty sweet movie.
