Just for the film\u2019s look - like without the story, it deserves an A++\r\n\r\nNot just the look (soo realistic especially the extras and the scenery) but the shots! There were a lot of street/chase scenes that was done beautifully. The clothes, the buildings\u2026it was so perfect!\r\n\r\nI liked the opening credits reminded me of Pink Panther & Catch Me If You Can but the opening scene, the painting of Tintin, was that Herge? so awesome!\r\n\r\nOf course as expected there were some changes like the sequence of events but it worked well for me (maybe not the crane scene but it didn\u2019t bother me that much) and I missed Professor Calculus, I thought it would include Red Rackham\u2019s Treasure. Now I can\u2019t wait for the next one, I want to see them all at Marlinspike Hall.\r\n\r\nAll in all, as a fan of Tintin comics (grew up reading it again and again), I loved it!!!", "created_at": "2017-08-18T05:53:33.942Z"}]
