It makes sense that these actors would band together to do a comedic project, but I can't imagine why they did an \"idiot boys club\" trope with a \"gay as comedy\" twist.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of Amanda Peet (but do watch \"A Lot Like Love\" and \"Brockmire\", oddly both baseball subjects), but she is the best actor in this by about a factor of 10.  She plays a highly intellectual character that just doesn't fit in the same world as these other characters (most likely by design), and even manages to do some action sequences with other people involved without them also doing the action sequences.\r\n\r\nWhile I like Jason Biggs, Amanda Detmer, and R. Lee Ermey, I'm not a Steve Zahn fan, and this is not Jack Black's best work.  Being as the majority of the movie is the latter and Amanda Peet, there is a lot of \"this is kind of annoying\" as opposed to \"this is kind of funny\".\r\n\r\nThe structural writing is actually good, but the premise and the comedic writing is ludicrous, and it is pretty hit or miss.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend it just because there are too many other options: just the number of abuse humor comedies starring Jason Biggs is enough to give you a list of suggestions for other movies.", "created_at": "2020-08-19T19:54:00.129Z"}]
