[{"movie_id": 252838, "review_id": "571cdc98c3a3684e98001832", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "> A comedy about to pull off the first ever Golden Tux.\r\n\r\nIn any movie if you see a sidekick rule, that has to be the Kevin Hart. He can handle the whole movie by himself and this film is a great example. It totally surprised me, I expected it to be an average film, but it was an awesome comedy. We have seen plenty of bride and groom and marriage related comedies, but this was a slightly different yet a fantastic treat.\r\n\r\nI don't think it was wonderful because of the jokes alone, but unique characters and actors who performed them were brought the fine outcome. I felt like I know what's coming, but the ending was simple and smart. Like always when I like a movie a lot I hope for a sequel to come and they should make one for this as well.\r\n\r\nIt's a Kevin Hart's time as a comedian, his top box office films are all from the recent time, so he must make use of it and I am expecting his upcoming projects. This is a perfect weekend movie to have some laughs. Middle finger to the film critics. I definitely recommended it not only for the film fanatics but all. Who knows you might find it much better than the recent 'Get Hard'.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd/10", "created_at": "2016-04-24T14:47:52.769Z"}, {"movie_id": 252838, "review_id": "571cdc98c3a3684e98001832", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "> A comedy about to pull off the first ever Golden Tux.\r\n\r\nIn any movie if you see a sidekick rule, that has to be the Kevin Hart.
