This vapid comedy (from director Catherine Hardwicke) feels like it was crafted by a soccer mom groupthink, with a ridiculous fantasy story that\u2019s struggling to be hip and edgy. It\u2019s a truly terrible movie that\u2019s a complete waste of time for everyone but those who have the absolute lowest of low standards when it comes to their choice of entertainment.\r\n\r\nLike most women, American mom Kristin (Toni Collette) has a lot on her plate. She keeps her home running despite dealing with the double emotional punch of her son going off to college as well as discovering that her cheating husband is having an affair. Things aren\u2019t going so well when she gets a mysterious phone call with a shocking message: she has inherited her grandfather\u2019s mafia empire in Italy. Guided by the firm\u2019s consigliere (Monica Bellucci), Kristin must gain the self-confidence to become the new leader of the (mafia) family business.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the fish-out-of-water premise is a good one. The story outline is fine, but the execution is a debacle. Although they are working within a very broad parameter of mass appeal, the screenwriting trio\u2019s (Amanda Sthers, J. Michael Feldman, and Debbie Jhoon) script feels like a struggle to stay above water. The writing talks down to the audience and narrative includes dumb scenarios that feel like a sad sack\u2019s fantasy (the worst being a hunky local guy (Giulio Corso) who is instantly smitten by Kristin the second she lands in Rome, and the eventual \u201ctwist\u201d that anyone with half a brain can see coming from a mile away). It\u2019s also filled with tired Italian stereotypes and has such a strong desire to be a \u201ccool and different kind of comedy\u201d that it earns an R rating with bloody violence and a bunch of cursing.\r\n\r\nEven worse is Collette\u2019s performance, which is an overblown exercise in desperation and overacting. Her take on the timeworn goofy, gullible American shtick feels like a huge stretch, to the point where her character becomes a weak caricature of a real woman. Kristin is a complete clown, even in a film that is trying (but not exactly succeeding) to tell a story of female empowerment. It\u2019s a tragic waste of Collette\u2019s talent. She is so much better than this.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t think of anything positive to say about \u201cMafia Mamma.\u201d Even your worst enemy deserves better.\r\n**\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREENZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "created_at": "2023-04-23T06:02:26.875Z"}, {"movie_id": 809787, "review_id": "649d5cfcc072a2012e23976f", "author_rating": 1.0, "review_text": "A completely stupid comedy.\r\nIt could have been an excellent film for having almost all the conditions for it.
