It turns out that a young girl disappeared from the family mansion some forty years earlier and he wants to know what happened. Meantime, the enigmatic young \"Lisbeth\" (Rooney Mara) is trying to break herself free from the influences/perversions of her legal guardian \"Bjurman\" (Yorick van Wageningen). She, having been the source of the information and investigation that lead to the earlier troubles of \"Blomkvist\" is particularly adept at survival!

The book is great, and this adaptation does it justice for the most part. Perhaps the screenplay could have been a little tighter, the first half hour takes it's time to get going, but once we have been introduced to this top notch cast representing the somewhat dysfunctional family then the pace of the film really hots up. For once, Craig delivers well and there are strong performances from Steven Berkoff, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Plummer ensuring that things build nicely to a denouement that, though perhaps not too surprising, is patiently and tensely delivered by David Fincher. Every bit as good as the first film version of this tale, a testament to what an A-list cast can do with a strong story and creative direction.
