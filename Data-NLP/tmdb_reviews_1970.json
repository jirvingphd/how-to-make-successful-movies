This, is an unusual horror to review. It\u2019s rather uncommon for the same director, in this case Takashi Shimizu, to remake his own original film for an entirely different audience.

No. Somehow, by remaking the exact story with essentially the same spine-tingling sequences, Shimizu downgraded the atmospheric aura of \u2018Ju-On\u2019, resulting in nothing more than a Japanese ghost boy releasing his inner cat and his ethereal mother croaking the life out of anyone who visits the cursed house.

There\u2019s no logic behind the structure. No foundational development. And certainly no characterisation. So the abrupt switching back and forth held no purpose, other than to illustrate a host of jumpy death sequences.
