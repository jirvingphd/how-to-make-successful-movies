We both enjoyed it. I wasn\u2019t concerned when a few reviews remarked that it moved slowly, as we have always appreciated movies that build a quiet story carefully, and mostly this one did that.\r\n\r\nMy only criticism is that at the outset of the movie, I didn\u2019t quite believe that Walter was in love with Kitty. He said he was, but I wonder if a scene or two showing him falling for her ended up on the cutting room floor. He merely seemed to stalk her around the party and want to marry her before he left for China. Similarly, Kitty falling for Charlie didn\u2019t seem well constructed. It felt like one scene they stared at each other, flirted a bit, and the next scene they are in bed.\r\n\r\nBut once I suspended that bit of disbelief, the film was great. Gradually Kitty develops as a character, and her marriage begins to be rebuilt from the rubble of her earlier actions.\r\n\r\nThe final scene, a few years after the action in the bulk of the movie, brings the story full circle in a satisfying manner. All around a fine movie well worth watching patiently.", "created_at": "2021-01-09T00:23:34.261Z"}, {"movie_id": 14202, "review_id": "632ba18f6af9dd007fc72f8e", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "I enjoyed this film a good more than I expected I would, based on the poor critical response and so-so viewer scores. Fortunately, Norton and Watts saved the film by turning in phenomenal performances. The real problem is that we never get totally invested in the characters. Nevertheless, The Painted Veil is a real love story.", "created_at": "2022-09-21T23:43:11.161Z"}]
