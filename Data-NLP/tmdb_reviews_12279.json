Almost like someone is making bets behind the curtain about whether or not they can get away with things.\r\n\r\nI'm the first person to get onboard with a \"stuck in a video game\" trope, but they made some really weird choices that offset it.  The inclusion of big celebrities that kids won't recognize is a little odd, but the in your face 3-d stuff is irritating, and there were several forced scenes, and a conflicting message of competition vs cooperation.\r\n\r\nThere are really high points of the movie: the story line itself is actually pretty good, the robot battle detour was actually a fun way to set up a call back, and there is a really good, if short, twist that I wouldn't expect in a kid's movie.\r\n\r\nThe last act was a little too insane for me, but I'm thinks kids might like it.", "created_at": "2020-10-08T01:42:10.034Z"}]
