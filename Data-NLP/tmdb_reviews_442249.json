[{"movie_id": 442249, "review_id": "5bb85cebc3a368242b0052fb", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "_The Purge_ has come a long way since its inception. Originally used as nothing more than an excuse to explain away \"Why don't they just call the cops?\" in your average home-invasion movie, the original _Purge_ movie had implied classism for the meat of it, and then an actual call to class division right at the end. Since then, the classism, and racism in American society has become a focal B-story to the _Purge_ movies, and now we're in 2018 for the prequel - _The First Purge_ - and those issues are now the whole point of the movie. Some might say that it's because the movies have lost any sense of subtlety, personally I think it's more that the creatives are sick of people missing the point.\r\n\r\n_The First Purge_ can't have been an easy thing to give the go-ahead in the current political climate over in the US, but it's important, and moreover, not a bad little film, socio-economic politics aside.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2018-10-06T06:57:47.820Z"}]
