Pearce works hard as Houdini but never gets to grasp the tormented angle of the man, while Jones is miscast and not even her pretty face can light up a dull performance. Ronan is sprightly enough and Spall shows some emotive verve as Houdini\u2019s concerned manager. The moments of trickery perk things up a bit, but even then the makers think it\u2019s wise to debunk the mysticism. The romanticism of the era, and that of Houdini\u2019s place in it, is well crafted onto the screen, but the flatness and confused thematic threads elsewhere leave this well below average. 4/10", "created_at": "2014-07-07T13:08:56.859Z"}, {"movie_id": 13910, "review_id": "53ba9be80e0a2676b800b875", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "Houdini Affairs of the Heart and Head.\r\n\r\nDeath Defying Acts is directed by Gillian Armstrong and written by Tony Grisoni and Brian Ward.
