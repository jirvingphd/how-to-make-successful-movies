The regurgitated theme of a twisted younger spicy vixen looking to get her sensual hooks on the hunky object of desire at the expense of the harried wife on the cynical sidelines has played out in other preferable big screen and cable TV-bound flicks. Here in **Bough** the tired formula comes off as another strained, eye-rolling rip-off pertaining to the otherwise revisited jeopardized love triangle scenario.\r\n\r\nThus, **When the Bough Breaks** loses its credible balance when the movie morphs into another hysterical female psychopath waving a sharp utensil around in the name of cartoonish, toxic outrage.

They are both blessed with looks, materialistic excess and thriving careers but there is one main thing that alludes them as being completely sound in their lives\u2013the playful addition of a baby to start their growing family. The marital tension has been building between the Taylors and a child seems to be the immediate solution to healing. Unfortunately, Laura has had three miscarriages in the past. The Taylors have experimented with surrogates to carry their baby but to no avail.

Anna, now impregnated, is at the mercy of Mike\u2019s beatings and decides to call John for help. John brings Anna back to his place to shelter away from the riff raffish Mike.

The tawdry scenes between youngish vamp Anna trying to seduce the wealthy yet unsatisfied older John feels mechanically orchestrated. The sex appeal among the main principals is an automatic given so there is bound to be some hormonal happenings in the bedroom or behind closed walls among the periled pretty people. In fact, Anna actually spies on the Taylors\u2019 private love-making session at one point but the payoff in watching this conniving cutie getting \u201cturned on\u201d by the private intimacy feels oddly uneventful and detached. Anna lusting after married stud-muffin John does not generate anything particularly provocative unless you find this curvaceous crackpot printing \u201cbaby\u201d on her puffed out tummy as the selling point of a twisted temptress gone to her loony limits.\r\n\r\nHad the filmmakers done a better job at exploring the damaged diva persona of Sinclair\u2019s Anna Walsh then maybe her tarnished tart routine would be more interesting and intriguing. Sinclair\u2019s Anna is reduced to \u201cbitchy and berzerk\u201d without much consideration in tapping further into her obvious \u201clost little girl\u201d syndrome. The trouble is that we have seen the Anna Walsh-type seductress in cinema numerous times before so the frenzied female in a tame and tedious **When the Bough Breaks** comes off as merely inconsequential. Sinclair certainly has perverse fun playing a \u201cpregnant plaything\u201d for Chestnut\u2019s stoic legal eagle that eventually bites into the alluring poisoned apple of Anna\u2019s tainted charm. It is too bad that the movie\u2019s unevenness and telegraphed toxicity recalls a scattershot flatness that never realizes its inspired potential.

The tawdry scenes between youngish vamp Anna trying to seduce the wealthy yet unsatisfied older John feels mechanically orchestrated. The sex appeal among the main principals is an automatic given so there is bound to be some hormonal happenings in the bedroom or behind closed walls among the periled pretty people. In fact, Anna actually spies on the Taylors\u2019 private love-making session at one point but the payoff in watching this conniving cutie getting \u201cturned on\u201d by the private intimacy feels oddly uneventful and detached. Anna lusting after married stud-muffin John does not generate anything particularly provocative unless you find this curvaceous crackpot printing \u201cbaby\u201d on her puffed out tummy as the selling point of a twisted temptress gone to her loony limits.\r\n\r\nHad the filmmakers done a better job at exploring the damaged diva persona of Sinclair\u2019s Anna Walsh then maybe her tarnished tart routine would be more interesting and intriguing. Sinclair\u2019s Anna is reduced to \u201cbitchy and berzerk\u201d without much consideration in tapping further into her obvious \u201clost little girl\u201d syndrome. The trouble is that we have seen the Anna Walsh-type seductress in cinema numerous times before so the frenzied female in a tame and tedious **When the Bough Breaks** comes off as merely inconsequential. Sinclair certainly has perverse fun playing a \u201cpregnant plaything\u201d for Chestnut\u2019s stoic legal eagle that eventually bites into the alluring poisoned apple of Anna\u2019s tainted charm. It is too bad that the movie\u2019s unevenness and telegraphed toxicity recalls a scattershot flatness that never realizes its inspired potential. Even when John\u2019s unscrupulous plot is revealed the shakeup does not change Bough\u2019s disjointed direction.\r\n\r\n**When the Bough Breaks\u2019** so-called chilly effectiveness is dramatically stiffened despite the glitzy shine of its photogenic cast and pseudo-steamy situations. Furthermore, the inability to seize the moments of the unintentional campiness is somewhat glaring as well. The-bad-girl-with-the-baby-bump thriller feels like a typical wet diaper\u2013relentlessly saggy while carrying an unexpected load it cannot handle.\r\n\r\n**When the Bough Breaks** (2016)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 33 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Morris Chestnut, Regina Hall, Jaz Sinclair, Romany Malco, Theo Rossi, Tom Nowicki\r\n\r\nDirected by: Jon Cassar\r\n\r\nMPPA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror/Drama/Suspense & Mystery\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016", "created_at": "2016-09-10T23:57:49.062Z"}, {"movie_id": 335791, "review_id": "585ebd01c3a3681a77010d3a", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "**It's like a falling tree dropping a seed on the ground.**\r\n\r\nI have to agree with the film critics on this one. Felt like I have already seen this film, but it turned out to be a very familiar thriller theme. It had plenty of issues and the first thing was the main plot in which the story built on. The mother-child connection is a very sensitive matter and that's where the film got stumbled. Even though they wanted to do film on that, they did not convince with the portrayed of the surrogate mother. From the entertainment perspective, it lacked the thriller big. The climax was all the sudden and then it ended just like that.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it might be a remake, but it was inspired or borrowed the theme from elsewhere. This psychological-thriller focused on to tell the tale of a wealthy childless couple. They decide to hire a young and beautiful Anna to be their surrogate mother. When everything was going very well, Anna's crush on the man she's carrying a baby begin to blow the things off. So now what happens to the couple, Anna and the baby revealed in the final segment.\r\n\r\nThankfully, this is not the worst film of the year. I have even worse than this. But this can be easily a skippable one. There's no complaint over the actors, they had given what the characters demanded. Rich in quality, not a bad film from the technical aspect. Those are the area where it got scored a few points from me. If the screenplay had developed well, the film would have been in a different league. Particularly, I did not like the lack of diversity, looked like a black film for the black viewers. There are lots of similar films which are much better than this one that you could try.\r\n\r\n_4/10_", "created_at": "2016-12-24T18:22:57.841Z"}]
