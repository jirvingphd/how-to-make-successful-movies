So it was quite a nice surprise to see it just be a single dude who rocks up to somebody else's Halloween Horror Nights-type deal and start wreckin' the place. From the outset I thought I was going to hate all the character's interactions, and don't get me wrong, these kids won't be taking home Oscars any time soon, but I did actually find myself quite taken with them before the end.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2019-01-20T10:13:23.277Z"}]
