I found <em>'Deck the Halls'</em> fun.\r\n\r\nDanny DeVito is the film's star, no question. If it wasn't for him I'd potentially be rating this lower, I admit. He gives an amusing performance, while the hearty stuff directly with him works. Matthew Broderick is a little forgettable here but still produces a good display. Kristin Chenoweth is probably the best of the rest, but it's all about DeVito in truth.\r\n\r\nI mentioned the heart works with the aforementioned actor, but elsewhere it's a a bit hit-and-miss. The final scene, that Chenoweth plays a part in, is very iffy - could've went either way, I just about liked it though. The humour is good, as is the plot - as silly as it is. I also really enjoyed how they did the lights.\r\n\r\nI got entertainment from this.", "created_at": "2020-12-19T01:32:42.942Z"}]
