[{"movie_id": 302688, "review_id": "577aa717c3a36820080014b2", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "> Another fat wedding in one big Greek family.\r\n\r\nA sequel after the 14 years, actually it was not bad. It followed a simple story of another fat wedding in the Toula's big family. Great to see them all once again, and I hope the third film as well will be made very sooner than another 14 years. This franchise has a wonderful set of the characters and each one was in a very unique that imprinted its trademark and so the film gave them all equal parts to explore the opportunity.\r\n\r\nYep, it's not anymore about Toula, particularly not in this part or if you're expecting it to be about her daughter, you will be disappointed, but it was a well distributed contents to all the characters and extracted as much as possible good comedies. Beside it was written by Toula (Nia Vardalos) like the previous film.\r\n\r\nMost of the stuff was as expected, like the slapstick humours. Not everybody would going love it, but if you had liked the first then definitely you would enjoy it as well. Even the first film was not a masterpiece and so this one yet undeniably a good entertainer. Nowadays, in this kind of theme you won't get a fresh storyline, but this one was very original. From the director by 'Everybody's Fine' fame, who really did a good job. A decent summer film, but a very enjoyable film with the family.\r\n\r\n6/10", "created_at": "2016-07-04T18:12:39.173Z"}, {"movie_id": 302688, "review_id": "577aa717c3a36820080014b2", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "> Another fat wedding in one big Greek family.\r\n\r\nA sequel after the 14 years, actually it was not bad.
