I like Grant's performance the most, bringing a likeable but flawed vibe to his character. Bullock is good in her role, too.\r\n\r\nIt probably is a forgettable film, but I do enjoy the humour. It keeps things pacing well, at least until the third act where the plot kinda ends with a whimper. Nothing else standouts, especially the supporting cast.\r\n\r\nThey could've/should've shaved twenty minutes or so off the run time to keep it fresher, but all in all I'd deem <em>'Two Weeks Notice'</em> as one that's worth viewing.", "created_at": "2020-07-12T01:58:24.467Z"}]
