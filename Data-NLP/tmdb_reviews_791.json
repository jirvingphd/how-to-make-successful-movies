The original film didn't shed a drop of fake blood, it wasn't the kind of extremely visual film we've grown used to in recent years, with blood spurting everywhere and chunks of flesh flying towards us.

However, the discovery of an old diary, written by one of the city's founders, finally brings some clarifications: after all, the entire city was founded at the cost of dozens of innocently killed human lives, and now, a hundred years later, his souls are returning from the sea, desirous of revenge.\r\n\r\nI confess that I expected more from this film. The truth is, if I didn't really know what happens in this movie (thanks to Carpenter's movie) I don't know if I would understand what's going on here. Terribly poorly written, the script fails to convey the whole story to us, and new audiences run the risk of not understanding everything. It's a messy story, with flaws and missing parts. On the other hand, the film lacks any kind of tension, suspense or functional mystery. It has some good things, it tries to involve more characters, to take the focus away from that isolated broadcaster at the lighthouse, but the truth is that I don't know if this was really a good idea, since the film was much less clear and understandable than its predecessor and none of the characters manages to engage us, or capture our sympathy and interest.\r\n\r\nDirected by Rupert Wainwright, it was the last feature film of his career, and although John Carpenter lent his name to the film, he has publicly stated that he was not involved in the project.
