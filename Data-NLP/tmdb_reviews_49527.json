This movie crams in so much in its short runtime, keeping the pace and energy high. There is no time for boredom. Check your phone, and you might miss something. Sam Worthington captivates audiences and is a sympathetic mastermind who pulls on the heartstrings while enacting his revenge. Man On A Ledge throws new challenges at the characters forcing them to get creative and adapt, keeping the movie fresh with its inexperienced characters attempting an ambitious heist. While all of its different story elements are simple or common on their own, these different plot pieces combine to make a fresh, fun, and entertaining heist film.", "created_at": "2022-09-25T04:54:06.744Z"}]
