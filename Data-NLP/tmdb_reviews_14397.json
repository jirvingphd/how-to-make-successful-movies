[{"movie_id": 14397, "review_id": "5a25b6eb92514103390e0a23", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "\"What's a demon, but an angel who fell?\" \nSuch is the question posed by this potent Omen clone...with a ransom twist. \n\nJosh Holloway stars as Max, a down-on-his-luck opportunist, freshly released from prison. Max probably has a history of complying with his older friend Sydney, who (at the start of the film) suggests that they (along with their other friend Vince) kidnap an 8-year-old for ransom.\n\nLittle David was hand-picked by the group's current employer (Jones), and although Max is reluctant at first, a denied bank loan leaves him no choice but to comply. However, it soon becomes quite clear that David Sandborn is probably no ordinary child.\n\nThis kid seems to know everyone's past and future, and the group can't help but notice they're constantly hearing whispers that seem to be in the kid's voice.\n\nRoxanne (Max's girl) has been against this \"gig\" from the beginning (partly due to a bad feeling, partly due to having a history with Vince). Maybe her intuition is telling her that this particular kid will do anything he can to turn them against each other.\n\nYoung David has a certain outcome in mind, and he will manipulate anyone who tries to stop him. Whisper is simply a brutalizer of a film in which a seemingly normal child is bloodthirsty, and there seems to be no limit to what he can achieve. 7/10", "created_at": "2017-12-04T20:58:19.525Z"}]
