The action is satisfying, with it featuring some neat death scenes. The plot, meanwhile, is one that has heart to it. Bruce Willis is suitably fun in the titular role and is joined by the terrific Dean Norris. Camila Morrone is the pick of the rest of the cast.\r\n\r\nIt's nothing deserving of any awards of course, but that's OK as this is a production well worth a watch - in my opinion at least.

And trust me, that hatred is nearly absolute.\r\n\r\nBut, the fiance wanted to see this. And I read the reviews here, and I read the critic's reviews...and noticed that the critics all hated it on the basis of \"NRA Propaganda\" In other words they hated it because...politics.\r\n\r\nAnd I am really not a fan of that unless it's blatantly political.\r\n\r\nBut, then I noticed that the audience reviews were largely the EXACT opposite of the critics reviews (with the odd absolute remake hater like me and the everything is political crowd).\r\n\r\nSo, why was that...had to see it.\r\n\r\nAnd since ALL the Death Wist movies seemed to be exactly the same, might as well.\r\n\r\nEli Roth...that name should say it all. It was graphic and gory and not in the boring Saw way, but in the fun ultra-violent entertainment way. And, really, I won't complain about that at all. It's one of the kind of movies I like for the sake of popcorn munching entertainment.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what you get here, pure entertainment with NO POLITICS, despite what the \"everything is political crowd\" says.\r\n\r\nIt is JUST a super gory and graphic crime movie and nothing more, nothing propagandist about it. It's really just violence and gore for the sake of entertainment,.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is, this is a remake that actually entertains. And since that is the primary purpose to sit down and watch a movie, if it meats that purpose, I recommend it and give it 10 of 10 stars.\r\n\r\nSo watch it...unless you have a weak stomach...because it will entertain you and it is a lot of fun.", "created_at": "2023-01-14T00:23:47.376Z"}]
