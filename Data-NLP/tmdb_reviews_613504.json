Since there is no reason for these two to be together, we don't give two craps if they aren't.\r\n\r\nNot that the movie doesn\u2019t try to manufacture such a reason; for example, Emotionally Scarred Bad Boy Hardin (Tiffin may be Ralph Fiennes\u2019s nephew, but comes across more as a young, Brittish-accented Joshua Jackson) has nightmares, but they stop when he starts dating Tessa. This is is total nonsense; sleeping with someone doesn\u2019t equal sleeping better.\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s the film\u2019s na\u00efve Love Conques All mentality. Love may indeed conquer many things, but an inert, lethargic plot is not one of them. The only part of the script that doesn't ring hollow is the title, which is very appropriate because the action, such as it is, completely lacks urgency. Nothing is resolved now, everything is left for later \u2014 to the point that two sequels were in the works at the time of this one\u2019s release.", "created_at": "2022-09-05T22:55:01.602Z"}]
