Recently I've seen many, that the stories told by women. It was a well made film, based on the real, about the WWII. Actually, it all begins prior like in the 1939. The happy couple who was running one of the most notable zoo in all of Europe, in the Poland capital, suddenly started to lose the animals for nazi air raids. The remains were taken away when the city, the nation was invaded. Soon the empty enclosure becomes hideout for the Jeweish. But it is not an easy task, the consequences are serious. How the rest of the story folds out was a little emotional.\r\n\r\nThe best performance by Jessica Chastain continues. She's choosing the nice films and roles. I had expected a big name pairing up with her, but the Belgian actor was good in a small part. Like any WWII film, a heart-wrenching story. Everything was told from the zookeeper's perspective, particularly the wife.\r\n\r\nThe story also takes us outside the enclosure, with a series of glimpses of horror visuals that we had seen in other films. So it limits to what these people did, that's to shelter the Jewish community. Another WWII film from another perspective that one should see it. I've heard that some are saying it was not honest. All the true stories are not exact depictions of truth, but somewhat close, lets us know the facts. Just watch it!\r\n\r\n_8/10_", "created_at": "2017-11-04T20:26:08.950Z"}]
