Well no \"Cassie\" (Kathryn Newton), not quite. You certainly developed the piece of communications kit that lands everyone in the quantum soup, but the blame really must go to Peyton Reed and Jeff Loveness for directing and writing this latest emanation from Marvel's increasingly un-special film factory. It starts off with a great little device that could quickly put Papa John's out of business before we are sucked into the cantina from \"Star Wars\" (1977) where our recently arrived travellers find themselves pursued by the ridiculously un-menacing \"M.O.D.O.K\" - a sort of robotic killing version of the golden statue from the top of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) after it had had a good time with \"V.I.N.C.E.N.T\" from \"The Black Hole\" (1979) - before Michelle Pfeiffer \"Janet\" explains to her family (and to us) just what has led them to a predicament where they must avoid the evil clutches of \"Kang the Conqueror\" (Jonathan Majors). Now this gift that keeps on giving for this studio never struggles to impress visually, and the imagination of those who create these magical effects and alien shapes and sizes must be commended. However, this latest offering featuring, in my view, the weakest of their arsenal of characters is just entirely derivative and unremarkable. Aside from a very few bon-mots from Paul Rudd the dialogue is dry and the action scenes are all concentrated in one or two sequences whilst the rest of this serves as little better than colourful padding for the thinnest of storylines. Rudd is quite an unassuming kind of actor. Engaging, yes - but somehow just too lightweight for the grandness of the surrounding imagery. Michael Douglas (\"Pym\") features sparingly and the cameo from Bill Murray might have worked better in \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" - here it is almost laughable. If these are to keep coming off the production line as thickly and quickly as seems likely, then somebody somewhere is going to have to spend much more effort on developing stronger and more compelling stories because the audiences are surely immune to the vibrancy of the special effects by now. This is really forgettable fayre.", "created_at": "2023-02-23T23:22:55.565Z"}, {"movie_id": 640146, "review_id": "6411f541323eba010b927262", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "A fun one!\r\n\r\nI had a terrific time watching <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'</em>, despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.\r\n\r\nStar of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em>, but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.\r\n\r\nLove the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M.O.D.O.K. is a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nLooking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this.

It\u2019s becoming such an uncontrollable urge by the studio to engage in this behavior that the cause-and-effect is resulting in disasters like \u201cEternals,\u201d \u201cThor: Love and Thunder,\u201d and now, \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d\r\n\r\nTrying too hard to force a non-story into the already lame Ant-Man mythology, the film reunites superhero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as Ant-Man and the Wasp. The pair find themselves thrust into the dangerous Quantum Realm along with Hope\u2019s parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with Scott\u2019s teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). As they explore the unusual terrain and alien society filled with strange creatures, Janet reveals that she didn\u2019t quite tell the group everything about the three decades she spent trapped in the realm. Facing new dangers from supervillan Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), the family must unite to stop a worldwide disaster.\r\n\r\nVery little about this project feels like a satisfying superhero movie and instead, it\u2019s more like an assemblage of other (and far better) science fiction films. If not for the titanic budget and big-name stars, it could almost be mistaken for a Redbox \u201cmockbuster\u201d of \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cMad Max,\u201d \u201cAvatar,\u201d and \u201cGodzilla\u201d combined.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place extensively in the Quantum Realm, which provides an unsightly setting of muted, dark brown, washed-out visuals. It\u2019s an ugly place, so who why would audiences want to spend time there? The Realm is a melting pot of exotic creatures and peculiar inhabitants that appear to have waltzed right out of the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine. They\u2019re cool to look at I guess, but was the point to make the film more appealing to children, or was it Disney\u2019s way of appeasing the animators by letting them have some fun?\r\n\r\nThe first third of the film seems like it\u2019s Janet\u2019s show, as she keeps bringing up the fact that she has all these secrets that she won\u2019t spill to Hope and Hank (even though they\u2019re all stuck in the Realm together). There\u2019s no compelling mystery nor reveal. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness is grasping at straws to craft a somewhat cohesive story while also struggling to make it fit into the MCU mythology. At some point, I wish someone would just make a damn standalone Marvel superhero movie and quit worrying about who and what goes where and how.\r\n\r\nThe story is frequently erratic. There\u2019s plenty of energetic CGI action, but there also some moments that play like a touching family drama, some that create an anti-climatic post-apocalyptic narrative, and lots of failed attempts at comic relief. The film also has recurring (and awkward) socially conscious messaging that doesn\u2019t entirely feel out of place, but it is aggressive (there\u2019s even a direct mention of socialism by one of the characters, which will really aggravate already-angry conservatives).\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is peppered with dreadful one-liners like \u201cit\u2019s never too late to stop being a dick!\u201d and \u201cants don\u2019t give up!\u201d I really, really wish I was joking about this.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the movie features a lot of talk about time, the desire to get home, and \u2014 Marvel fans, you know what\u2019s coming \u2014 the multiverse! It\u2019s that one little word that means endless movies, endless stories, and endless money. It\u2019s also the easy way to guarantee that all of these films in the canon always have a cop-out to lazily excuse away any inconsistencies (not that many of us could keep up or remember anyway).\r\n\r\nAnother major problem with the film is that it can only chug along on Rudd\u2019s likeability (and the cast\u2019s talent) for so long. It\u2019s barely tolerable until Kang shows up, but he\u2019s a wickedly delicious character portrayed by a terrific actor (it\u2019s a real shame that this had to be the film for Majors\u2019 MCU debut). In fact, the entire cast deserves better. Despite all of them turning in strong performances, they still feel mostly wasted here.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\u201d lacks the memorable spectacle that most superhero films need in order to succeed. There\u2019s no massively rousing, crowd-pleasing moment, and it\u2019s one of the more unremarkable entries in the MCU.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS**", "created_at": "2023-04-23T06:10:51.993Z"}, {"movie_id": 640146, "review_id": "64498ab70f21c604ec28527a", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Okay, there are a plethora of reviews here by Marvelettes and more, so I will only give my gut response.

It\u2019s an ugly place, so who why would audiences want to spend time there? The Realm is a melting pot of exotic creatures and peculiar inhabitants that appear to have waltzed right out of the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine.

It\u2019s also the easy way to guarantee that all of these films in the canon always have a cop-out to lazily excuse away any inconsistencies (not that many of us could keep up or remember anyway).\r\n\r\nAnother major problem with the film is that it can only chug along on Rudd\u2019s likeability (and the cast\u2019s talent) for so long. It\u2019s barely tolerable until Kang shows up, but he\u2019s a wickedly delicious character portrayed by a terrific actor (it\u2019s a real shame that this had to be the film for Majors\u2019 MCU debut).

Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.\r\n\r\nThe overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.\r\n\r\nThe performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.\r\n\r\nFinally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience.

The first two Ant-Man movies were so great because they were low-stakes with self-contained stories that weren't consumed with saving the universe but instead were set in less a fantastical world that allowed the goofy size-changing antics really shine. Quantumania threw Ant-Man into an outrageous world, changing him from the zany character of the film to the normal character and stripping him of some of his charm.

Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.\r\n\r\nThe overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.\r\n\r\nThe performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.\r\n\r\nFinally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience.

It felt like a Thor: Ragnarok impersonation, and lost the fun of the other Ant-Man films.**\r\n\r\nMy feelings are so mixed on Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The first two Ant-Man movies were so great because they were low-stakes with self-contained stories that weren't consumed with saving the universe but instead were set in less a fantastical world that allowed the goofy size-changing antics really shine. Quantumania threw Ant-Man into an outrageous world, changing him from the zany character of the film to the normal character and stripping him of some of his charm. Quantumania felt like a cross between Thor: Ragnarok and Rise of Skywalker with some Power Rangers sprinkled in there, and the result was\u2026 decent. It really wasn't a bad movie. It has some funny parts and was better than most of Phase 4. Bill Murray was loads of fun for his brief part and Jonathan Majors is going to be an awesome big bad in the MCU.

Unfortunately, the excessive, repetitive, unnecessary dialogue driven by exposition, along with a lack of stronger tonal balance - fewer jokes by Marvel standard, but the cringe level affects transitions to/from more serious moments - and an underdeveloped narrative devoid of true stakes - character arcs are almost non-existent - make this an overall very inconsistent watch.

Well no \"Cassie\" (Kathryn Newton), not quite. You certainly developed the piece of communications kit that lands everyone in the quantum soup, but the blame really must go to Peyton Reed and Jeff Loveness for directing and writing this latest emanation from Marvel's increasingly un-special film factory. It starts off with a great little device that could quickly put Papa John's out of business before we are sucked into the cantina from \"Star Wars\" (1977) where our recently arrived travellers find themselves pursued by the ridiculously un-menacing \"M.O.D.O.K\" - a sort of robotic killing version of the golden statue from the top of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) after it had had a good time with \"V.I.N.C.E.N.T\" from \"The Black Hole\" (1979) - before Michelle Pfeiffer \"Janet\" explains to her family (and to us) just what has led them to a predicament where they must avoid the evil clutches of \"Kang the Conqueror\" (Jonathan Majors). Now this gift that keeps on giving for this studio never struggles to impress visually, and the imagination of those who create these magical effects and alien shapes and sizes must be commended. However, this latest offering featuring, in my view, the weakest of their arsenal of characters is just entirely derivative and unremarkable. Aside from a very few bon-mots from Paul Rudd the dialogue is dry and the action scenes are all concentrated in one or two sequences whilst the rest of this serves as little better than colourful padding for the thinnest of storylines. Rudd is quite an unassuming kind of actor. Engaging, yes - but somehow just too lightweight for the grandness of the surrounding imagery. Michael Douglas (\"Pym\") features sparingly and the cameo from Bill Murray might have worked better in \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" - here it is almost laughable. If these are to keep coming off the production line as thickly and quickly as seems likely, then somebody somewhere is going to have to spend much more effort on developing stronger and more compelling stories because the audiences are surely immune to the vibrancy of the special effects by now.

Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently.

It\u2019s becoming such an uncontrollable urge by the studio to engage in this behavior that the cause-and-effect is resulting in disasters like \u201cEternals,\u201d \u201cThor: Love and Thunder,\u201d and now, \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d\r\n\r\nTrying too hard to force a non-story into the already lame Ant-Man mythology, the film reunites superhero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as Ant-Man and the Wasp. The pair find themselves thrust into the dangerous Quantum Realm along with Hope\u2019s parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with Scott\u2019s teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). As they explore the unusual terrain and alien society filled with strange creatures, Janet reveals that she didn\u2019t quite tell the group everything about the three decades she spent trapped in the realm. Facing new dangers from supervillan Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), the family must unite to stop a worldwide disaster.\r\n\r\nVery little about this project feels like a satisfying superhero movie and instead, it\u2019s more like an assemblage of other (and far better) science fiction films. If not for the titanic budget and big-name stars, it could almost be mistaken for a Redbox \u201cmockbuster\u201d of \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cMad Max,\u201d \u201cAvatar,\u201d and \u201cGodzilla\u201d combined.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place extensively in the Quantum Realm, which provides an unsightly setting of muted, dark brown, washed-out visuals. It\u2019s an ugly place, so who why would audiences want to spend time there? The Realm is a melting pot of exotic creatures and peculiar inhabitants that appear to have waltzed right out of the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine. They\u2019re cool to look at I guess, but was the point to make the film more appealing to children, or was it Disney\u2019s way of appeasing the animators by letting them have some fun?\r\n\r\nThe first third of the film seems like it\u2019s Janet\u2019s show, as she keeps bringing up the fact that she has all these secrets that she won\u2019t spill to Hope and Hank (even though they\u2019re all stuck in the Realm together). There\u2019s no compelling mystery nor reveal. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness is grasping at straws to craft a somewhat cohesive story while also struggling to make it fit into the MCU mythology. At some point, I wish someone would just make a damn standalone Marvel superhero movie and quit worrying about who and what goes where and how.\r\n\r\nThe story is frequently erratic. There\u2019s plenty of energetic CGI action, but there also some moments that play like a touching family drama, some that create an anti-climatic post-apocalyptic narrative, and lots of failed attempts at comic relief. The film also has recurring (and awkward) socially conscious messaging that doesn\u2019t entirely feel out of place, but it is aggressive (there\u2019s even a direct mention of socialism by one of the characters, which will really aggravate already-angry conservatives).\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is peppered with dreadful one-liners like \u201cit\u2019s never too late to stop being a dick!\u201d and \u201cants don\u2019t give up!\u201d I really, really wish I was joking about this.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the movie features a lot of talk about time, the desire to get home, and \u2014 Marvel fans, you know what\u2019s coming \u2014 the multiverse!
