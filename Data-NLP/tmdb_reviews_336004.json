It was from the 'The Tournament' director and has a good cast. De Niro playing a small role is a disappointment, but for his age it was not bad.

Really well shot film, the production was good and this is where the big stars and the B movie meets. Seen a lot worse than this, so quite enjoyable and instantly forgettable film.\r\n\r\n6/10", "created_at": "2016-09-01T23:02:10.910Z"}, {"movie_id": 336004, "review_id": "57c8b37292514148de000aca", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "> A father's desperate attempt to save his sick daughter!\r\n\r\nEven though the film visually resembling with 'Speed', the story was completely different and okay kind.
