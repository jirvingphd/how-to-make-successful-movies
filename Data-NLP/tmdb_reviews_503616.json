While a comedy, Second Act focuses on the story of a sharp woman without traditional credentials that learns to find success by being true to herself. The story is inconsistent, but there are plenty of funny moments throughout, particularly when the Monday Moms are on screen. The film's best part is Jennifer Lopez's character finding and reuniting with her long-lost daughter, whom she had to give up for adoption as a young teen. The supporting cast of quirky characters is entertaining too. But the lead character makes some dishonest decisions and lies to her loved ones repeatedly, making the viewer feel conflicted about rooting for her. Ultimately, Second Act gets distracted from its own story making the ending feel haphazard, stitched together, and uninspired. Still, a comedy not wrapped up in romance but a mother/daughter relationship is a nice change of pace.", "created_at": "2022-10-21T20:13:04.125Z"}]
