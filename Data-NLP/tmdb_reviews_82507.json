We thought Tiktik, which is a Filipino horror movie, was already showing.  Apparently, it is not scheduled until next week.  Then we saw Sinister\u2019s poster, which said, \u201cfrom the producer of Paranormal and Insidious\u201d.  We have seen both movies and we both didn\u2019t like Paranormal but both enjoyed Insidious. So we said, okay\u2026let\u2019s watch this instead.\r\n\r\nDidn\u2019t know anything about this movie Sinister so as we walked inside the empty movie house, I wondered which one is it going to be like. Is it going to be a homemade movie about paranormal activities with three different endings? Oh please\u2026I fervently hope not! I crossed my fingers because I noticed there were rolls of super 8 films on the poster. Or is it going to be about demons capturing souls and possessing the physical body with a non-happy ending? Or is it going to be a totally different story?  I hoped it would be.\r\n\r\nWe were the first two of the five people who came to watch this movie.  The others were a group of three teenage girls, who surprisingly didn\u2019t scream or shout at all, throughout the screening.  What a joy to be watching in silence and absolute peace!\r\n\r\nOkay, on to the movie review\u2026\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with a scene shot like a home video, so I go like, uh-oh\u2026 But don\u2019t be disheartened. It\u2019s nothing like Paranormal and deeper into the story, you\u2019d see that it is more like Insidious. That much I would tell you.\r\n\r\nThe story is about a real crime stories writer, played by Ethan Hawke (the only actor I know in the movie), who moved his entire family to a house where a family was hung to death in the backyard tree and their little girl still missing.  In the course of his research and with the help of rolls of seemingly innocent and happy family home videos that mysteriously appeared in the attic, he discovers more brutal murders of different families in different houses. So there\u2019s the question\u2026 Are these murders in any way related, considering there\u2019s always a little child missing?\r\n\r\nI must say that I find the premise of the story original. Well, at least for me. So I give it 4.5 gems for Story and Originality...\r\n\r\nContinue reading on: http://heblogs-sheblogs.com/2012/10/sinister-movie-review/", "created_at": "2012-10-17T15:26:43.000Z"}, {"movie_id": 82507, "review_id": "561de70bc3a3686cd60011d8", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "Bughuul the Bastard!\r\n\r\nAfter moving himself and his family into a new house that was the scene of a horrendous crime, true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) finds a box of 8mm \"snuff\" films that suggest the murder he is currently researching is the work of a serial killer whose career dates some way back still further...\r\n\r\nIt is becoming the un-reviewable genre, horror that is, there are just too many splinters of horror to choose from and so many people to cater for.
