My f=general impression, though, is that this original is better.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Lisbeth character is the real hero here. A rough childhood and beyond have molded her into a tough lady indeed, mentally, physically and emotionally. Oddly enough, she is the only character who seems to show any growth by the end of the film, perhaps partly due to her having so much room to grow emotionally.", "created_at": "2021-12-05T13:11:35.273Z"}]
