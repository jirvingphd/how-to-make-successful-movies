Again \r\nKenneth Branagh leads on the direction and main role (the belgian detective Hercule Poirot), while on his retirement in Venice, in post-war Venice, 1947.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is by Agatha Christie (obviously) and Michael Green (Blue Eyed Samurai, Blade Runner 2049, Logan, and the previous two movies of this series \"The Murder on the Orient Express - 2017, and Death in the Nile - 2022). \r\n\r\nIt is a way better movie than Death in the Nile, but it doesn't reach the level of Orient Express tho. In all passes in a dark Venice palazzo, in a strange empty Venice, that is shown only into the begging and the end (that were actually shots on a London Studio as much of the movie). The CGI effects are really nice into deleting modern things (and actual tourist) nto some obvious closed famous spots on close angle shots. \r\n\r\nThe cinematography of Haris Zambarloukos (another close colleague into Branagh works like the previous movies and Belfast) is really beautiful, even into the dark settings that can be into closed spaces or huge claustrophobic rooms. I've read somewhere that the actors weren't aware when something like a closing door, etc would happen, but I bet that after the first one the trick didn't work again.\r\n\r\nOn the story side, Branagh is spot on Poirot again. The story follows the usual premise of a crime with several characters involved, but I killed the charade into mid-movie (knowing how usually Agatha Christie Stories area - I can't really compare to the book as I didn't even read it). But it is enjoyable anyway if is that that you search.\r\n\r\nThe story plus acting and beautifully well done cinematography and settings ensure a 7,0 out of 10,0 / B on my score. How I miss to see Venice again.", "created_at": "2023-11-13T14:11:36.007Z"}]
