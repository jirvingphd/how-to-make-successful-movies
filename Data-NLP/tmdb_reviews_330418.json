They recover things that have been lost by people by going back in time but do so under the guise of astrology. However, during one such excursion into the past, they meddle more than necessary and this prevents the death of Kuzhandaivelu (Ravi Shankar), a gangster and extortionist, who is actually tragetting Rajarathinam (Jayaprakash), the father of Elango's girlfriend Anu (Mia George).
