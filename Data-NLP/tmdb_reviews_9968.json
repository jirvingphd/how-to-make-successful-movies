[{"movie_id": 9968, "review_id": "5e6ee44e357c00001344d83a", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "***Quirky crime/dramedy with loads of black humor tries a little too hard***\r\n\r\nThe owner of a small travel agency in Alaska (Robin Williams) loves his wife with Tourette Syndrome (Holly Hunter), but he\u2019s financially strapped and needs funds fast. After stumbling upon a frozen corpse he hatches a harebrained scheme that draws the suspicion of an obsessed insurance claims investigator (Giovanni Ribisi). Alison Lohman plays the latter\u2019s live-in girlfriend while Woody Harrelson plays the protagonist\u2019s wild brother. Tim Blake Nelson and W. Earl Brown are also on hand as goofy wannabe hitmen. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Big White\u201d (2005) is similar to \u201cFargo\u201d (1996), but more eccentric and comedic. Imagine \u201cA Simple Plan\u201d (1998) or the later \u201cSugar Mountain\u201d (2016) if they were oddball black comedies and you\u2019d have a good idea.  \r\n\r\nThe cast is notable and it\u2019s entertaining enough for what it is while attempting to balance the unsavory with the honorable, but it tries a bit too hard to be offbeat (which I suppose is better than not trying enough). Meanwhile the locations & cinematography are great, Lohman is stunning in a cute way and the score is exceptional.   \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Whitehorse, Yukon. The bulk of the outdoor sequences and cinematography were shot at summit of the White Pass along the border of Alaska and British Columbia, not far from Skagway.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+", "created_at": "2020-03-16T02:28:30.504Z"}]
