Imagine a braid, but one of the strands careens off and crashes into another strand and then it completes anyways, it should look like an Escher sketch: that's this movie.\r\n\r\nIt's fun.  You get 3 quality actors to be some of the worst people you could write (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, and Colin Ferrell), and, not that first 3 were funny, have 3 quality comedic actors (Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikas, and Charlie Day) play 3 of the most flawed, average people you could write in respective situations of explosive seriousness in which they will ultimately be humiliated.\r\n\r\nI think that's a pretty good formula, and they got a sequel out of it, so I feel pretty secure in that opinion.\r\n\r\nIn all respects, if this was just written with a more serious atmosphere, it could be powerful.  I'm not saying taking the \"dick and fart\" jokes out of it would make it more enjoyable, but it would certainly make it more powerful.\r\n\r\nIf you're a working adult, or you just like watching horrible things happen to people, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this one.", "created_at": "2020-07-11T22:20:00.470Z"}, {"movie_id": 51540, "review_id": "6471fd87a199a60116c6effa", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Funny movie.
