A small town with a rather precarious overhanging rock gets by day-to-day with the help of their own local superhero. He's called \"Super-Lion\" and he lives quietly with his daughter 'Hedvig\" who is a bit of a gaming addict. When tasked to do the laundry, she has a bit of a mishap and dad's empowering suit is now half the size it needs to be! Maybe it's serendipity? Perhaps it is time for him to hand on the baton to his successor before chaos engulfs their community. Well, possibly, except she proves to be pretty hapless in training - despite the best efforts of her father, and her grandmother! The job is hereditary, and so dad spreads his net a bit wider to include his rather accomplished, if full of himself, young nephew \"Adrian\" who takes to the role like a duck to water. The suit makes people stronger but it also augments their less attractive traits and so soon the new \"Super-Lion\" starts to become a bit of a selfish liability. Can dad, his own predecessor (grannie) and young \"Hedvig\" save the day? It's quite an entertaining animation that bashes a few stereotypes about the head and offers us some engaging characterisations for eighty minutes that look at determination, loyalty and friendship along with providing a few slapstick, life-saving, comedy scenarios. The animation itself is a bit basic, and it is annoyingly over-scored at times, but it did deserve to be seen by more than just me in the cinema.", "created_at": "2023-08-06T08:08:22.567Z"}]
