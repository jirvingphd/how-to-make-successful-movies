The killers were basically doing what they did in the first one, so that stays true to the source material, and then we get this amazing 80s soundtrack throughout the movie. Heck, we can almost enjoy Bonnie Tyler's 'Total Eclipse Of The Heart' in its entire length, while at the same time sitting there with the eyes glued to the screen, because you don't want to miss a single detail. That is some really great directing here and as a result, I like this sequel even much more than the first one. And that is a very great compliment towards the entire cast and crew.
