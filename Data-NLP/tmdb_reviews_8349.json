The blockbuster-ish \u201cFlyboys\u201d is entertaining, but marred by comic book storytelling (think \u201cLegends of the Fall\u201d).

Werner Voss was only 20 when he was shot down while actor Til Schweiger was in his mid-40s during shooting. Lena Headey is a milder example. The score is good, but conspicuously rips-off the superior \u201cThe Last of the Mohicans\u201d in two parts.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not all bad.
