The distinguishing bracket for the story revolves around Warren honestly writing his new sponsor-child in Tanzania. June Squibb plays his wife, Dermot Mulroney his imminent son-in-law and Kathy Bates the latter\u2019s mother. Howard Hesseman also shows up.          \r\n\r\n\u201cAbout Schmidt\u201d (2002) is a coming-of-old-age road flick, far superior to the similar \u201cEverybody\u2019s Fine\u201d (2009) with De Niro. You can\u2019t help but think of Thoreau\u2019s observation \u201cThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\u201d But, unlike the dull De Niro film, this one has a sense of humor amidst the melancholic-but-insightful proceedings.  \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a lesson on the negative side of giving up your life to the grind for a good paycheck and nice house in the \u2019burbs. Yet, also, that it\u2019s never too late to live again, as well as realize & perhaps make up for your sincere, but sincerely wrong shortcomings.     \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 5 minutes, and was shot in Nebraska and surrounding points.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "created_at": "2020-04-05T02:13:41.580Z"}]
