[{"movie_id": 306745, "review_id": "57a37579c3a36832b800751c", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "> Not another lesbian romance, but a fight for the equal rights!\r\n\r\nNot long ago I saw 'Carol', thankfully it is not another that and better than that. It was based on the documentary short of the same name about a real life same sex couple who fought for the equal rights and the pension benefits, while one of them was treated for cancer. It is a great drama about fighting for justice than the romance as it states, but that part as well very impressive.\r\n\r\nEllen Page and Julianne Moore, both were awesome, except Moore was a bit old. By seeing them I felt being a lesbian is sweetest than straight, hetero and even gay. The first half was all about the relationship, but very decently narrated romance tale. And in the next half once Steve Carell enters the scene, the film diverted to another side of the story. All the actors were very good, including Michael Shannon.\r\n\r\nObviously the story was predictable and that is expected often in a biography. Because if they want to alter it, then they should pen a very cleverest script the audience never saw one like that before. I think telling a true story as it is is the point and that's what this filmmaker did. So don't complain about the storyline, just consider whether it is inspiring or worth a watch for other reasons.\r\n\r\nFor me it was almost a sentimental piece, but the second half story compromised and then I realised what this film was trying to say. Underrated film of the year for sure. Anytime I suggest it, especially for the grown ups and with a neutral mindset, because it is not all about the same sex romance, but the battle for equality in society.\r\n\r\n8/10", "created_at": "2016-08-04T17:03:53.292Z"}, {"movie_id": 306745, "review_id": "57a37579c3a36832b800751c", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "> Not another lesbian romance, but a fight for the equal rights!\r\n\r\nNot long ago I saw 'Carol', thankfully it is not another that and better than that.
