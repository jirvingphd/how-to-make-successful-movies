No. It could have used a few tweaks in the edit suite, and a couple more on the page. Yes, the \u201cwoman\u201d, \u201cwomen in comedy\u201d and \u201cwoman of colour\u201d angles are pushed and pushed hard - but then again, isn\u2019t that what the movie is about? Nothing is too in-your-face or shoved down your throat, but you will notice it as these are things you don\u2019t often come across in cinema (or ever).  I just would have preferred if Kaling\u2019s character had the personal and professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to be right as well as just righteous, but that\u2019s just me. Either way, she\u2019s great and holds her own against the dynamo force that is Thompson, relishing in her element as a smart, powerful female with a mean streak. \u2018Late Night\u2019 is definitely worth the privilege of our time.\r\n- Jess Fenton\r\n\r\nRead Jess' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-late-night-the-ladies-of-comedy-have-come-to-make-waves", "created_at": "2019-08-03T05:51:15.165Z"}]
