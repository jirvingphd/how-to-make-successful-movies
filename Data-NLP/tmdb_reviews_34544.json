I was worried that, as a fan of the original TV-series when I was a kid, I would be disappointed but it had actually captured the spirit of the series quite well. It was fun to watch, with a nice blend of comedy and action. Okay, the famous tank scene was perhaps a bit over the top but, what the hell, it\u2019s supposed to be an action film with a touch of comedy so...Naturally the so-called \"critics\" wrote it down, for instance on Rotten Tomatoes, but if you switch to the tab which shows what the actual audience said, it got a greater than 70% approval rating. IMDB also gives it a bit more than 7 stars out of 10 which I would say it\u2019s well worth.", "created_at": "2017-06-15T10:30:06.934Z"}, {"movie_id": 34544, "review_id": "5afabc4bc3a3680e7600754e", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "I never watched the original TV series, beyond a vague awareness of Mr. T I knew literally nothing about it. Which meant that I couldn't feel like this reboot was letting me down, but I also was in no way ingratiated with the franchise. Seemed like the positives and negatives of going in blind like that sort of cancelled each other out, and that's pretty much the attitude I've got to the movie itself. There was cool stuff, there was some lame stuff, and all in all they levelled themselves out for a pretty average movie-watching experience.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._", "created_at": "2018-05-15T10:54:03.028Z"}]
