This one - originally from 1955 - was maybe not my favourite of these classic stories, but it still in no way deserved this imbecilic remake from the Coen brothers. Tom Hanks (\"Prof. Dorr\") is a typical Southern gentleman who inveigles his way into the home of elderly Christian lady \"Marva Munson\" (Irma P. Hall) and under the guise of practising their musical numbers, he and his gang set about committing a daring robbery of a casino located next door. What really wrecks this for me in the constant use of expletives. The original story is simple, slapstick even, with subtly paced humour that allows the story to develop in a gently menacing fashion. This is just a charm-free, in-your-face, frontal attack on your senses that rarely raises a smile, has nothing even remotely touching about it and even the old lady isn't averse to a little bit of angry behaviour that would have had Katie Johnson spinning in her grave. These original films are a crucial piece of the jigsaw puzzle that depicts the evolution of cinema comedy, and this is just a shockingly poor travesty of an adaptation.", "created_at": "2023-09-04T05:22:25.889Z"}]
