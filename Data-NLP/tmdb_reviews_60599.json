It all centres on an overly convoluted plot that tries to follow a sort of borrowing/laundering/ponzi scheme taking cash from Peter to repay Paul before Fred finds out that his money never really existed in the first place. All whilst their broker - in this case \"Miller\" (Richard Gere) is gadding around the world in private jets, staying at the best hotels and spending money that, well, isn't! Susan Sarandon features sparingly as his wife and Tim Roth makes a bit of an effort as the cop who starts to get wise to his antics, but for the most part this is a really dry and unsophisticated vehicle for a star well off his form with little by way of humour or, indeed, innovative or even interesting dialogue. I rather appreciated the end - it has the virtue of being rather unexpected, but otherwise this is all immediately forgettable stuff.", "created_at": "2022-07-22T18:42:39.552Z"}]
