There's a lot of silly sort of conveniences that did bother me some, but it also made me feel something, which I don't often get out of modern-day kids' movies. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2019-12-29T02:47:59.093Z"}]
