The acting was good, the plot was fairly well thought out, and it was very funny. It helps if you are a zombie movie(i.e. G. Romero)fan and enjoy British type humor(like the Monty Python troupe), but if you are neither it will not stop you from enjoying this movie. It is a weird mix of several genres(coming of age, buddy movie, comedy, love, horror)but it definitely works on all levels. The main characters(Shaun and Ed)will definitely remind you of some slacker you knew(or know) The facial expressions, dialogue, and general behavior of these two make for some of the best scenes in the movie. There are also some very good make-up effects, and a decent amount of gore. This is definitely one worth owning.", "created_at": "2017-03-28T16:18:43.276Z"}]
