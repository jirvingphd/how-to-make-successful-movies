Unfortunately first time director and co-writer Michael Brandt thinks he's John le Carr\u00e9 and in his attempts to be clever and tricky for the final third of pic, he just comes off as an amateur who is insulting his audience.\r\n\r\nInitially the pic is on safe footings. Ok! so it's conventional in formula, but the intrigue is there, Richard Gere and Topher Grace in the lead roles have our attention, and a turn of events at the 30 minute mark has us firmly in the story's grip. Sadly it never materialises into the top line suspense thriller the makers clearly were aiming for.\r\n\r\nAs the narrative spins into a muddled mess, Brandt is forced to rely on a couple of livewire sequences to save the day; cue interrogation machismo and some car crash chaseville, but it's never enough to save the day. More so when Martin Sheen wanders back into the fold, it is here when you realise you have forgotten he was in the pic anyway! That pretty much says it all. 4/10", "created_at": "2019-02-09T17:49:06.573Z"}]
