Being a comedian, Will Ferrell was as usual awesome, but Wahlberg contribution had an equally advantageous.\r\n\r\nThe story was a one liner, but individual comedy scenes made an impact for its grand scale success. Generally, the scenes from the comedy films are easy to predict, so in this I felt similarly, but in the many parts it kept turning in another direction. Tried its best to avoid cliches, but we know that's impossible. Either way, it carried out some decent laughs.\r\n\r\nThe movie was all about the dad versus the step-dad. When a man thinks he's finally getting along with his step-kids, then comes their real dad who threatens to take aback his wife and children. So they go head-to-head and followed by a chain of life changing events comes a suitable conclusion. But there's a loop in the end, so possibly we can expect a sequel. Knowing it was not the best comedy of the year, I was not upset either for overall movie. I can even suggest it if you are looking for a simple entertainment.\r\n\r\n7/10", "created_at": "2016-03-24T13:36:38.666Z"}, {"movie_id": 274167, "review_id": "645e772df90b19017202d439", "author_rating": 10.0, "review_text": "Really funny.
