Communism and United States are like two opposite poles. So portraying an American who supports it is a challenging task for any moviemakers. But the director of 'Meet the Parents' did a great job. Yep, you don't have to take sides while a watch. Of course, the movie discussed the issue of conflict over the types of ruling system, but it was only in the initial part that kind of looked strong. While the story advancing, that topic completely weakened and concentrated more on other stuffs. So don't expect it to be a fight for the constitutional, but a wonderful biography of one of the talented screenwriters in the history of Hollywood.\r\n\r\nCommunism or Democracy, whatever you support that does not matter here to choose whether you want watch it or not. Because this movie very smartly outlined how people are affected when they believe differently from the majority of others around. In the opening, I thought it could be an anti-hero tale, but later it transformed the angle of presentation and indeed in the end the main character turned into a most likeable one.\r\n\r\nI liked Dalton Trumbo, not for what he preferred to support, but how he handled it all. The rival group is who made it a big concern, otherwise he is a neglectable for his egoist nature. Bryan Cranston was amazing in the title role. It's his best in the lead role, after only to the 'Breaking Bad'. Hope he's going to make more lead role films now after. Kind of of inspiring flick, of course, from his professional angle. Definitely one of the best films of the 2015 and deserved its Oscar nod.\r\n\r\n8/10", "created_at": "2016-02-24T17:53:47.939Z"}]
