His acting was good in his laid back style and carried the movie in places, I thought, but I was a bit distracted by the more lackluster performance of a few others. Dwight Yoakum, for example, whose singing I have always enjoyed, seemed to deliver his lines woodenly at times.\r\n\r\nBut I won\u2019t dwell on critiquing here and there. Overall it was watchable. It just seems like it could have shown more spark if Eastward had lit a fire under a few butts during some of the scenes.

Clint Eastwood is way too old to even attempt being a romantic lead.  The senoritas making a play for him was farcical.  He's also too old to be an action star.  As far as bustin' broncos, you could almost see the stunt man being called in to take the reins.  The kid was supposed to be a streetwise hellion, but the only hint of that was that he could apparently boost old cars.

It\u2019s not even a scene, really; just a brief exchange of the short-but-sweet variety. I mention it because I wish more of the film were like that.\r\n\r\nThe two protagonists speak English, and yet there is a language barrier issue going on here. Specifically, the actor who plays Rafael, Eduardo Minett, makes you go for the 'mute' button almost every time he opens his mouth \u2014 the exception being when he falls back on his native Spanish.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the young man\u2019s fault, and it happens to the best of them; just listen to Jean Gabin in Moontide, or Javier Bardem in Loving Pablo, or Salma Hayek, Sofia Vergara, and Penelope Cruz in any of their English-speaking roles.\r\n\r\nNow, I understand he\u2019s playing a Mexican boy who speaks English as a Second Language, and I\u2019m also aware that his character is not meant to ingratiate himself with the audience immediately, of even fully \u2014 indeed, Rafael remains largely unchanged and unwiser until the end, but I\u2019d like to think this is by design; the film as a whole may be viewed as a short section of a very long circle, and Mike (Clint Eastwood) and Rafael\u2019s intriguing next-to-last conversation foreshadows the latter character\u2019s narrative arc eventually going all the way around to where he is as sensible, though presumably also as old, as his current companion.\r\n\r\nWe find out only slightly more about where Mike is coming from than what we can guess at about where Rafael is headed, but the one\u2019s past and the other\u2019s future are heavily implied in both men\u2019s present; the irony is that Rafael couldn\u2019t skip the poor choices that await him any more than Mike \u2014 whose admonitions fall, Cassandra-like, on deaf ears; wisdom is earned, and non-transferable \u2014 can go back and avoid his own missteps. The movie\u2019s events are thus, for lack of a better term, Rafael\u2019s preschool of hard knocks.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I\u2019m just reading too much into it; perhaps this is just what my brain occupied itself with while I tuned Minnet and his execrable English accent out. Eastwood would have done well to make Rafael as ignorant of English as Mike is of Spanish (or, why not, have Rafael refuse to speak Mike\u2019s language until the conclusion, to the latter\u2019s surprise, after finally having gained a modicum of the former\u2019s respect), so there could have been more non-verbal communication.", "created_at": "2022-09-06T21:45:38.153Z"}, {"movie_id": 749274, "review_id": "64973b5ceb79c200e29ea29a", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "**_Teaching a boy the ropes of life while traveling through Mexico_**\r\n\r\nAn old-as-dirt ex-rodeo star (Clint Eastwood) is given the task of bringing back the early- teen son of a rancher (Eduardo Minett and Dwight Yoakam respectively) from Mexico City to west Texas in which they have several misadventures. Fernanda Urrejola plays the boy\u2019s mother while Natalia Traven is on hand as a woman they meet along the way.\r\n\r\n\u201cCry Macho\u201d (2021) has similarities to past Eastwood flicks, like \u201cThe Mule\u201d (2018), \u201cGran Torino\u201d (2008), \u201cA Perfect World\u201d (1993), \u201cHonkytonk Man\u201d (1982) and \u201cBronco Billy\u201d (1980). It\u2019s a road movie wherein the characters get to know each other as they go from one experience to another. The nuance here is contrast of one character coming-of-age while the other is coming-near-death.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s drama, humor, potential violence and a hint of romance. Like \u201cThe Mule\u201d and \u201cBronco Billy,\u201d it\u2019s thoroughly mundane, but also somehow (a little) revelational and heartwarming. \"All the Pretty Horses\" (2000) is also comparable, as is \"Rambo: Last Blood\" (2019), just minus the action.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in the heart of New Mexico (Belen and Polvadera). \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-", "created_at": "2023-06-24T18:52:12.859Z"}]
