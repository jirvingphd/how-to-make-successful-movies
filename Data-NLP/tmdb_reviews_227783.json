It's supposed to be two parallel mob heist stories, but they don't really line up past there being a heist.\r\n\r\nNone of the characters are interesting or likeable, maybe the girl squirrel, the dog, and the mute rat but that's more because they are lovable stupid / naive.  You're not supposed to still dislike the \"heroes\" at the end of the movie.  The writing parts of this that are remotely interesting are too complex for kids to get and they don't pan out.\r\n\r\nIt's literally a lot of \"squirrels like nuts\", \"squirrels try to get nuts\", \"humans don't like squirrels\", repeat.\r\n\r\nAnything endearing about this is more annoying.  Even when the \"twists\" happen, they don't mean anything because they're all still jerks, even if they happened to do the right thing.", "created_at": "2020-07-25T22:32:51.577Z"}]
