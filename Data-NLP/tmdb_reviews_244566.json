A story like this I never thought would do fairly, a better movie from the average section. I think not without the Aubrey Plaza, she as a Beth was excellent. Not a career defining performance, but funny enough. The story looks only faintly different from other similar films, but a few good scenes saved it. If it had a couple more good jokes and maybe a twist, surely would have been done greatly at the box office.\r\n\r\nThere's no surprise material in it, I thinks that's negative about it. Easy to read the situation and predict the story within the first 15 minutes, but the second half was drastically changed its pace as well as the atmosphere in the story. If you've not seen many zombie films, especially comedy ones, then you may find it better than average.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a decent direction for a first timer, got a good support from the cast. For a small budget, this is a wonderful production quality. It surely upset you if you expect like 'Warm Bodies' or 'Shaun of the Dead', but if you know all about it before giving a try, the disappointment will be lessened and you may have a decent time pass with it.\r\n\r\n6/10", "created_at": "2016-03-14T17:27:06.918Z"}, {"movie_id": 244566, "review_id": "56e6f46ac3a36807b2003e5b", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "> Back to normal is sometimes not good.\r\n\r\nThe movie did not reach my expectation, but still I enjoyed watching it.
