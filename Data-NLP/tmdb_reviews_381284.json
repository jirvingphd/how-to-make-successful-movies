Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.\r\n\r\nThe film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.\r\n\r\nThe others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!\r\n\r\n_8/10_", "created_at": "2017-09-16T21:00:34.121Z"}, {"movie_id": 381284, "review_id": "5d6213c56dea3a001194e5b0", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Do not at all think that by my feelings I attempt to diminish the achievements of those who made _Hidden Figures_ nor the real women around which the story revolves, this simply just wasn't for me.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._", "created_at": "2019-08-25T04:51:17.739Z"}]
