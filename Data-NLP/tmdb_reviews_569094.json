There are plenty of special moments and guest appearances that follow from the more obscure to the mainstream and the range of emotions from the audience at the press screening as they reacted to the film showed they were deeply engaged and loving it.\r\n\r\nThe film does take a darker turn and does end in a cliffhanger which sets up the next film very well but also may be a bit darker than younger viewers might want. That being said; I enjoyed this film far more than I did the prior film. I found the animation style a bit off-putting as the jerky way the characters moved was a bit much over the length of a feature film. This time around there is a mix of animation styles throughout and at times in the same frame which may be a bit hard for some as the film does come at the viewer with waves of flashing lights, sounds, and animations that very cleverly mimic reading a comic complete with small boxes to define various characters from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe film runs nearly two and a half hours and did seem to go on a bit long at times but thanks to the great voice-acting and strong cast as well as engaging storyline I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next film.\r\n\r\nI first saw a rough cut of a scene at Cinemacon in 2022 and it was amazing seeing the final scene near the opening of the film as it was a rare instance of a film surpassing expectations and delivers the storyline and action with a good dose of solid characters that fans will love.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5", "created_at": "2023-05-31T14:58:50.182Z"}, {"movie_id": 569094, "review_id": "647d1518e323f300c42a9fc3", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Sad night tonight. After 80-odd years, this was the last film to show in my local cinema before it closed down. Doubly sad because it\u2019s also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you\u2019d expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey\u2019s seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it\u2019s moments - assuming you can catch it - and there\u2019s a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole \u201cmultiverse\u201d theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for \u201cMiles\u201d and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.", "created_at": "2023-06-04T22:50:00.570Z"}, {"movie_id": 569094, "review_id": "647e0f700fb39801180e8f4b", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-is-an-animated-work-of-art/\r\n\r\n\"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the epitome of incredibly detailed, gorgeously unique, undeniably epic animation within its medium. Separately from enjoying this movie or not, any or all cinephiles should bow to the ridiculously talented artists and animators behind this pure work of art.\r\n\r\nThat said, the attributes and issues are more or less the same as the original. The various animation styles are overwhelmingly stunning, but also to the point of creating confusing moments. Gwen Stacy stands out from the rest of the pack \u2013 both the character and Hailee Steinfeld's voice performance \u2013 but everyone on screen is impressively captivating. The voice cast is superb all-around.\r\n\r\nAn unfinished story \u2013 remember, this is the first of two parts \u2013 about what it really means to be a hero.

The Spot is an insanely cool villain, Spider-Man 2099 is an anti-hero teetering on the verge of becoming a full-time villain, and Spider-Punk oozes overall awesomeness.\r\n\r\nBut with the film sitting at 162 minutes and a sequel on the way in less than a year, the story ultimately feels like it\u2019s stretched beyond its means.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/07/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review-a-stunning-labyrinthine-benchmark-for-animation/", "created_at": "2023-06-08T20:23:22.049Z"}, {"movie_id": 569094, "review_id": "6499e4de62f3350127477b22", "author_rating": 10.0, "review_text": "I don't know, but in my humble opinion, the punk Spider-Man really needed to look like Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, someone from the Sex Pistols.  He sort of screamed them in the way he was depicted, right down to the multi-media used around him.\r\n\r\nThey really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  I mean, throw us a bone here.  He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's not bad.  Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he's developed the moniker \"Mild Morales.\"  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here).  \r\n\r\nBut he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.\r\n\r\nIt also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed. \r\n\r\nAnd I am still very upset over how Peter is portrayed, but they are slowly redeeming his character.\r\n\r\nOver-all though, it's not bad.  It's better than just about all of the current Super-Hero movies and, honestly, it's probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in... because it isn't totally political BS.", "created_at": "2023-06-26T19:19:58.329Z"}, {"movie_id": 569094, "review_id": "64a046750cb33500fe5e8b7a", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "Rating: 9.5\r\n\r\nOverall, another groundbreaking film in the franchise that only builds on everything they created in the previous film as the brilliant animation and incredible writing is used to show the audience a well-rounded story about a Spider-Man who is trying to find his place in the world, with the only major drawback of the movie being that it suffers from the flaws of it being one of two parts.", "created_at": "2023-07-01T15:29:57.366Z"}, {"movie_id": 569094, "review_id": "64cca1752f266b09ef121de5", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "I don\u2019t have that much to say about \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d, the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d except that it\u2019s easily one of the best films of the year. It\u2019s the type of achievement in animation that\u2019s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it\u2019s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.\r\n\r\nMiles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he\u2019s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn\u2019s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.\r\n\r\nThe plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don\u2019t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it\u2019s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they\u2019re a great onscreen duo.\r\n\r\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn\u2019t one misstep to be found.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d is the type of film that proves animation isn\u2019t just for kids, and it\u2019s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It\u2019s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema.
