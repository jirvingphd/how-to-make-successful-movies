Stephen Merchant takes over the role of Caliban from T\u00f3mas Lemarquis, who played the character in X-Men Apocalypse, and transforms him into an ally to Logan and Charlies.

In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.\r\n\r\nJames Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold's love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.\r\n\r\nLogan's Run!\r\n\r\nAh yes, well being \"adult\" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very \"human\" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.\r\n\r\nTech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is \"A\" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.\r\n\r\nOne of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10", "created_at": "2017-08-05T11:16:28.016Z"}, {"movie_id": 263115, "review_id": "6257b53fa6fdaa00682c5b81", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "All but exhausted after years of fighting and hiding, \"Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) just wants a peaceful life.

Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very \"human\" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.\r\n\r\nTech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is \"A\" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.\r\n\r\nOne of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10", "created_at": "2017-08-05T11:16:28.016Z"}, {"movie_id": 263115, "review_id": "6257b53fa6fdaa00682c5b81", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "All but exhausted after years of fighting and hiding, \"Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) just wants a peaceful life. Aside from the occasional trip to Mexico to help the sun-shy \"Caliban\" (Stephen Merchant) with his medication, it's all pretty routine and low-key. That is, until \"Laura\" (Dafne Keen) pays him visit - and she has a mutation just like his. Who is she? Of course, she doesn't come alone. \"Pierce\" (Boyd Holbrook) has been charged by scientist \"Rice\" (Richard E. Grant) to track her down and capture her. It now falls to our eponymous hero to fend them off and get her to safety. What follows now are several highly polished, but frankly repetitive, escapades as their enemies close in. Sure, the effects are great and the production quality is top drawer, but the flaw with someone who has (albeit limited, by this stage) self healing powers is that the same, or slightly tweaked, scenarios happening over and over again start to get a bit dull after a while. Jackman looks as tired with the role as his character is with the relentlessness of his existence and though quite easy on the eye, Holbrook isn't up to much (I kept thinking he was Charlie Hunnam). I was never the biggest fan of this franchise once they split it out to follow \"Wolverine\". Jackman is an hugely charismatic actor but his character isn't remotely sophisticated and though there is some humour to be found, for the most part I found this an action-packed but pretty long and unremarkable piece of cinema.", "created_at": "2022-04-14T05:46:39.880Z"}, {"movie_id": 263115, "review_id": "63e709f0a2e60200932955fe", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "**Logan tones down the effects and scale to focus on the emotion and pain of its characters, making it one of the best films in the X-Men saga.**\r\n\r\nJames Mangold strikes again! Logan is considered by many to be one of the greatest superhero films ever made. While I don\u2019t feel as strongly as many about this film, its quality is undeniable. Jackman and Stewart\u2019s performances were the best of the franchise. The story adapts the Old Man Logan comic to depict an aged weary Wolverine that is more jaded and bitter than ever. This new world where the X-Men have all perished or disappeared is more dangerous than ever for mutants. But Logan\u2019s heart is slowly restored by a young girl on the run that seems destined to follow in his footsteps unless he finds a way to give her a new future and hope. Mangold\u2019s vision and directing fill the film with emotion and pain. Logan\u2019s suffering and hopelessness are tangible and felt in every moment of the film. While I missed the vibe and characters of the other X-Men movie, Logan was an excellent film that gave a meaningful conclusion to Wolverine\u2019s long and heartbreaking journey.", "created_at": "2023-02-11T03:22:24.543Z"}]
