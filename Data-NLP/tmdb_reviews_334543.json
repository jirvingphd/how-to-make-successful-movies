The film \u201ccleaned up\u201d the Australian film awards and won some BAFTA awards, but lost the Oscars for which it had been nominated and was categorically ignored by the Golden Globes. By the way, while we're at it, it's quite difficult to understand how Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman \u2013 the film's protagonists and its main actors \u2013 ended up being nominated for Oscars in the Supporting Actor/Actress categories!

He only appears near the middle of the film because the story begins in the character's childhood, yet he didn't hesitate and confidently embraced his character with charisma and talent.
