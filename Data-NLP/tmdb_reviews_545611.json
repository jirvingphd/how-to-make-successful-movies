Michelle Yeoh leads the troops in a film that also pays homage to the iconic career of the actress who, at 59 years old, accompanies the fantastic stunt team in truly outlandish fights.\r\n\r\nThe mother-daughter relationship as the emotional core of the story follows a surprisingly predictable path and needs a few more dialogues to deliver an even more powerful climax, but it still induces tears and a genuine sense of concern for the characters.\r\n\r\nTechnically, all the elements are so creatively unique that it warrants the clickbait \"you've never seen anything like this\".\r\n\r\nSee it in theaters!\"\r\n\r\nRating: A", "created_at": "2022-04-23T11:05:12.473Z"}, {"movie_id": 545611, "review_id": "6283cc07dcf875334dd350af", "author_rating": 10.0, "review_text": "A truly sensational film! The utter definition of a must-watch.\r\n\r\n<em>'Everything Everywhere All at Once'</em> is impressive from every single viewpoint. I had heard murmurs of it being a great film, yet it still managed to completely smash my expectations. This 2022 release features a superb cast, a fascinating story and some top notch visuals. The editing and pacing, in particular, are brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe onscreen talent are all fantastic, but Michelle Yeoh is still the absolute standout from this. What a performance! I could watch her in this role over and over and over. With that said, Ke Huy Quan (welcome back!) is awesome as well, as are Stephanie Hsu, James Hong and Jamie Lee Curtis. Everyone plays their part very, very well.\r\n\r\nAll of the humour lands, with some parts being truly funny. It also manages to show supremely enjoyable action alongside a highly meaningful side too.

The former is a lady trying to balance the books at her failing laundry who must face the wrath of the latter - an imposing IRS investigator. Add to her woes, she has her hapless husband \"Waymond\" (Ke Huy Quan); her recently out lesbian daughter \"Joy\" (Stephanie Hsu) and her imperious and disapproving father \"Gong Gong\" (James Hong). Frankly, this poor woman does not have her troubles to seek. Then, all of a sudden, there is a rift - and in best Lewis Carroll tradition, \"Evelyn\" finds herself in not just one, but in multiple realities where she has everything from superpowers to a need to save the world from beings that would permanently unravel all the layers of existence on planet Earth. It's frankly impossible to adequately evaluate the plot - it lurches, veers, wobbles and meanders all over the shop with precious little linear to guide the viewer. It is a tour de force from Yeoh, well directed and scripted - frequently amusingly - that asks just as many questions as it strenuously attempts to avoid answering. It is aptly titled - and you need to have your eyes (and your brain) on wide beam to get the most from this feast of ostensibly nonsensical, but often poignant, series of escapades that search for what could constitute any degree of life-satisfaction for \"Evelyn\". A second viewing is highly recommended - it has plenty more to give once you've calibrated your senses after the first time, and big screen shows off some great VFX that do not impose themselves on this character-driven movie.", "created_at": "2022-05-29T15:17:31.398Z"}, {"movie_id": 545611, "review_id": "62983f64ca83541355d46d07", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Very imaginative movie.

This connection had a nice arch throughout the story but failed to draw me in emotionally. I understood what I should feel in those impactful moments but had a hard time connecting.\r\n\r\nThe performances were great. Ke Huy Quan was incredible and one of the highlights of the entire movie. His switch from clueless doppy husband to multi-versal warrior had me hysterically laughing. Michelle Yeoh is fantastic and deserving of all her praise and award buzz.\r\n\r\nDespite my problems with a lack of connection to the story, the action really raises this movie as a whole. There is something so captivating about 60-year-old women performing incredible complex kung fu against one another. The brutality is superb and incredibly fun to watch. Another layer to the action is the actions our characters must perform to tape into their multi-versal selves.

There is a good message in the movie, which is an atmosphere that contains a rush about oneself and how important we are in this universe, at the same time you discover that you aren't important in this universe.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong emotional factor in the movie, which is the story of a mother with her daughter and the love of the family, but the film sometimes took unexpected comedic paths and was affected by the emotional factor.

Here you see the idea is similar, but in multiple universes, and you see these multiple universes and you see the options.\r\n\r\nThis movie makes you think about your personal decisions and makes you think that there are people like you, but in other universes they made decisions that affected you. Here this idea is creative, but what bothered me was the comedic situations at the wrong time. There are emotional scenes that were touching. Great dialogue scenes, but they were damaged by the comedy because sometimes the movie Reminds me of Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography, editing, and music were wonderful, which was an essential factor in the film's story. The scene of the rocks was eye-catching, wonderful, deep and poignant, but at the same time the director decided to show this story and how he used somewhat disgusting comedic tools.
