The costume design is gorgeous besides being extremely important since it actually elevates the story by clearly identifying who's rich and poor. Production and set design are fantastic. Great cinematography (Christopher Blauvelt), and an enjoyable score (Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer). Nevertheless, as outstanding as the technical achievements might be, the film still lacks a unique directing style, which is normal, having in mind it's the director's first feature.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Emma. doesn't reach the latest period movies' level like The Favourite or Little Women, but it's a fine start for debutants director Autumn de Wilde and screenwriter Eleanor Catton. Anya Taylor-Joy delivers an exceptional performance as a very well-written Emma Woodhouse, carrying the film on her shoulders until the very end, cementing her place in Hollywood as one of the greatest actresses of her generation. The rest of the cast is also pretty great. The costume design steals the \"technical show\", but the production level in this movie is impressive. However, the narrative lacks surprising elements, making the existence of this new adaptation a bit questionable. Why make another film if there's nothing unique about it? Predictable from the get-go, confusing first act, and very hard to feel invested before the one-hour mark. If you enjoy period comedy-dramas, I recommend it. Otherwise, the two movies mentioned above are probably a better choice...\r\n\r\nRating: C+", "created_at": "2020-03-22T14:27:28.095Z"}, {"movie_id": 556678, "review_id": "5f0b9ddf1f98d100372355cb", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Thinly plotted but enjoyable enough drama-comedy with a nice performance from Anya Taylor-Joy.

I was ready to not like it.\r\n\r\nBut instead I discovered that wondrous creativity was launched to make small tweaks to details. There was Harriet Smith, who may have been plain, but marching here and there with her classmates, dressed in matching red dresses and large hats, providing a very striking Image for the eye. There were the chorale music resonating at the end of scenes, leading to or melding into the beginning of the next scene. And Bill Nighy, who was suitably wary of illness and draughts, but had a spring in his step at times to juxtapose with his fearfully cautious nature.\r\n\r\nI thought Rupert Graves and Miranda Hart were imaginative choices for the roles of Mr. Weston and Miss Bates. And there is even an creative tweak to the one-word title, whereby a period is added after the name to indicate that the movie is - wait for it - a period piece.\r\n\r\nSo this is the third version of Emma in the past 25 years - two movies and a mini-series - and for now at least, it is my favorite.", "created_at": "2020-09-12T20:27:14.810Z"}, {"movie_id": 556678, "review_id": "5f8b47c4fe077a0037307f8a", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "Well, what a happy surprise.
