Usually, I avoid trailers for most movies, but it\u2019s almost impossible to not catch an image or a clip here and there. However, for Scary Stories, since it wasn\u2019t heavily marketed in my country (at least), the only things I knew was that Guillermo del Toro was involved and that it was a horror flick. Knowing del Toro, I also remembered myself that this wouldn\u2019t just be a straightforward horror story, filled with predictable jump scares, and a bland narrative. That\u2019s my first advice to my fellow readers: if you expect a film similar to those of The Conjuring Universe, then you\u2019ll be disappointed.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also not the other extreme. It doesn\u2019t follow the ambiguity and weirdness of Jordan Peele\u2019s installments, so if you\u2019re one of those people that don\u2019t appreciate that type of horror, you\u2019re safe as well. Having in mind the latest movies released from the genre, it\u2019s hard to find one that balances these two separate takes instead of choosing one of them. Scary Stories spends its first half slow-building their characters, but mainly its story. There\u2019s a massive build-up to something that\u2019s pretty much the premise of the film, so it struggles to reach the actual \u201caction\u201d without it becoming a tad boring or too long. It\u2019s a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d (in the genre, I mean) to have a good set up, with decent character development, and an exponential interest in the main story, instead of jumping into silly horror sequences fifteen minutes after it started.\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal does an excellent job in directing. He really knows how to generate suspense and create a genuinely creepy build-up. There\u2019s tremendous camera work involved in some fantastic sequences that don\u2019t rely on jump scares to provide the \u201cfear\u201d factor. It\u2019s the never-ending suspense, that feeling of claustrophobia even if the character isn\u2019t in a confined space. Except for one scene, we can always see what\u2019s happening. The \u201cmonsters\u201d don\u2019t appear out of nowhere, they don\u2019t screech at you precisely at the third time a character looks another way, and the actual jump scares are rather efficient. However, they\u2019re not scary, as well as the movie itself\u2026\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not simply a scary film. It doesn\u2019t have that heavy and dark tone that we feel in other horror movies. At first, I thought it might be a bad thing, but Scary Stories establishes this distinct tone from the very beginning. Even without knowing a single thing about the film, I understood from the first few minutes that it was going to be \u201cdifferent\u201d. I would advise caution to not judge this movie by its trailers if they indicate that this is one of those films to make you scream every five minutes. There\u2019s definitely a message to be transmitted, and I think it was well-delivered in the ending. It might be too cheesy for some or lack impact for a movie that asks the audience for a bit of patience, but for me, it worked well enough.\r\n\r\nThe acting is mostly good. Zoe Colletti (Stella) and Michael Garza (Ramon) are undoubtedly the standouts, and they do a good job of carrying the narrative forward. They both have compelling backstories, but for the time that the film spends developing its characters, I wish they went more in-depth with Stella. She has a particularly intriguing past, and I don\u2019t think we get enough out of it. Gabriel Rush (Auggie) and Austin Zajur (Chuck) have great chemistry, but their comic-relief roles are a disservice to an otherwise pretty solid movie.\r\n\r\nTechnically, there are some beautiful shots from the DP, Roman Osin. Usually, sequences at night in low-budget films suffer a lot with lack of clear visibility, but Osin does a remarkable job, playing with lighting in a truly unique way. I\u2019m curious to know what audiences will think of this movie. If I had to bet, I think people will leave disappointed due to the lack of more generic jump scares, and a straightforward narrative. Truth be told, the slow pacing doesn\u2019t help, especially when the character development only works for two. Finally, the \u201cscary stories\u201d that Sarah tells are entertaining and imaginative, and the whole concept of this film is incredibly captivating.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a distinct horror flick, with well-developed leads, and a creative approach to an unique premise. It doesn\u2019t follow the rules of generic horror, by not relying itself too much on jump scares, and making the actual story and characters the main interest. Beautifully-produced by Guillermo del Toro and co. as well as brilliantly directed by Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal. The \u201cscary stories\u201d are indeed dark and creepy, providing a whole second-half of excellent horror scenes. \r\n\r\nHowever, the first-half takes its time to set everything up, and the lack of more \u201caction\u201d might leave some viewers disappointed. Only two characters are genuinely engaging, which proves that the slow build-up didn\u2019t entirely pay off as it should have. It\u2019s meant to be a divisive movie, but I definitely recommend seeing it!\r\n\r\nRating: B-", "created_at": "2019-08-19T11:16:04.250Z"}, {"movie_id": 417384, "review_id": "5d8b2638172d7f001f50246f", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "There\u2019s just enough scares to appeal to the under-15s with disposable income, but very little for anyone else looking to get into the real Halloween spirit. \u2018Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\u2019 has the potential to be really unique, but is let down by its blandness and lack of originality.

Usually, I avoid trailers for most movies, but it\u2019s almost impossible to not catch an image or a clip here and there. However, for Scary Stories, since it wasn\u2019t heavily marketed in my country (at least), the only things I knew was that Guillermo del Toro was involved and that it was a horror flick. Knowing del Toro, I also remembered myself that this wouldn\u2019t just be a straightforward horror story, filled with predictable jump scares, and a bland narrative. That\u2019s my first advice to my fellow readers: if you expect a film similar to those of The Conjuring Universe, then you\u2019ll be disappointed.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also not the other extreme. It doesn\u2019t follow the ambiguity and weirdness of Jordan Peele\u2019s installments, so if you\u2019re one of those people that don\u2019t appreciate that type of horror, you\u2019re safe as well. Having in mind the latest movies released from the genre, it\u2019s hard to find one that balances these two separate takes instead of choosing one of them. Scary Stories spends its first half slow-building their characters, but mainly its story. There\u2019s a massive build-up to something that\u2019s pretty much the premise of the film, so it struggles to reach the actual \u201caction\u201d without it becoming a tad boring or too long. It\u2019s a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d (in the genre, I mean) to have a good set up, with decent character development, and an exponential interest in the main story, instead of jumping into silly horror sequences fifteen minutes after it started.\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal does an excellent job in directing. He really knows how to generate suspense and create a genuinely creepy build-up. There\u2019s tremendous camera work involved in some fantastic sequences that don\u2019t rely on jump scares to provide the \u201cfear\u201d factor. It\u2019s the never-ending suspense, that feeling of claustrophobia even if the character isn\u2019t in a confined space. Except for one scene, we can always see what\u2019s happening. The \u201cmonsters\u201d don\u2019t appear out of nowhere, they don\u2019t screech at you precisely at the third time a character looks another way, and the actual jump scares are rather efficient. However, they\u2019re not scary, as well as the movie itself\u2026\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not simply a scary film. It doesn\u2019t have that heavy and dark tone that we feel in other horror movies. At first, I thought it might be a bad thing, but Scary Stories establishes this distinct tone from the very beginning. Even without knowing a single thing about the film, I understood from the first few minutes that it was going to be \u201cdifferent\u201d. I would advise caution to not judge this movie by its trailers if they indicate that this is one of those films to make you scream every five minutes. There\u2019s definitely a message to be transmitted, and I think it was well-delivered in the ending. It might be too cheesy for some or lack impact for a movie that asks the audience for a bit of patience, but for me, it worked well enough.\r\n\r\nThe acting is mostly good. Zoe Colletti (Stella) and Michael Garza (Ramon) are undoubtedly the standouts, and they do a good job of carrying the narrative forward. They both have compelling backstories, but for the time that the film spends developing its characters, I wish they went more in-depth with Stella. She has a particularly intriguing past, and I don\u2019t think we get enough out of it. Gabriel Rush (Auggie) and Austin Zajur (Chuck) have great chemistry, but their comic-relief roles are a disservice to an otherwise pretty solid movie.\r\n\r\nTechnically, there are some beautiful shots from the DP, Roman Osin. Usually, sequences at night in low-budget films suffer a lot with lack of clear visibility, but Osin does a remarkable job, playing with lighting in a truly unique way. I\u2019m curious to know what audiences will think of this movie. If I had to bet, I think people will leave disappointed due to the lack of more generic jump scares, and a straightforward narrative. Truth be told, the slow pacing doesn\u2019t help, especially when the character development only works for two. Finally, the \u201cscary stories\u201d that Sarah tells are entertaining and imaginative, and the whole concept of this film is incredibly captivating.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a distinct horror flick, with well-developed leads, and a creative approach to an unique premise. It doesn\u2019t follow the rules of generic horror, by not relying itself too much on jump scares, and making the actual story and characters the main interest. Beautifully-produced by Guillermo del Toro and co. as well as brilliantly directed by Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal. The \u201cscary stories\u201d are indeed dark and creepy, providing a whole second-half of excellent horror scenes. \r\n\r\nHowever, the first-half takes its time to set everything up, and the lack of more \u201caction\u201d might leave some viewers disappointed.
