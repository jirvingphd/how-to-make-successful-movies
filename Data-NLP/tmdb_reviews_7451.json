[{"movie_id": 7451, "review_id": "64f42f159e4586013af8fb34", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Vin Diesel is actually quite good in this as an adventurer who manages, frequently, to wind up US law enforcement by causing mischief and mayhem against those he thinks deserving of exposure. When NSA agent \"Gibbons\" (Samuel L. Jackson) arranges for him and his team to be dumped in the Czech Republic they have a choice - infiltrate a ruthless gang of Russian hoodlums bent on world domination or... go to jail. Initially, the team think it's all an hoax but as it becomes clear that they actually are in a real scenario it all starts to heat up. Diesel has bags of charisma, attitude and muscle on screen, for this. Sure, it's not new nor will the writing and dialogue cause you to need a dictionary (unless you are about seven years old) but as action films go, it is perfectly watchable with plenty of car chases, pyrotechnics and gadgets", "created_at": "2023-09-03T07:00:37.771Z"}]
