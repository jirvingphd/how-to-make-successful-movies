However, what sets this movie apart from its contemporaries is its poignant exploration of Maggie's struggle with Parkinson's disease.\r\n\r\nThe movie can be divided into two halves: the first is a typical rom-com, complete with witty banter and charming flirtations between Jamie and Maggie. However, midway through the film, the tone takes a dramatic shift as the focus shifts to Maggie's struggles with her illness. The movie becomes intimate and shockingly raw as Jamie tries to cope with the future struggles he and Maggie will face together, while simultaneously portraying Maggie's struggle to let someone in and take care of her. This story really works and brought tears to my eyes near the end.\r\n\r\nWhile the direction is pretty bland and lacks any real sense of style, the performances are strong. Both Hathaway and Gyllenhaal have excellent chemistry and play off each other perfectly. However, the real standout performance comes from Josh Gad, whose comedic timing is brilliant and whose scenes had me laughing out loud.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of the movie that detracts from its overall impact is the excessive use of nudity. Hathaway is shown topless in almost every scene, to the point where it feels quite predatory. While I am not sure if the choice to include this excessive nudity was made by the director or writing team, its frequency detracts from the intimacy of the characters' interactions and feels quite gratuitous.\r\n\r\nOverall, Love & Other Drugs is a solid romantic comedy that attempts to do something a little different, which I can definitely appreciate. Its exploration of illness and its effects on relationships adds a layer of depth and emotion that the typical rom-com formula usually lacks.\r\n\r\nScore: 70% \ud83d\udc4d\r\nVerdict: Good", "created_at": "2023-05-16T16:06:39.573Z"}, {"movie_id": 43347, "review_id": "6463aa0f0f365500e20cd49b", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "On the surface, Love & Other Drugs appears to be a typical romantic comedy that follows the tried-and-true formula of a ladies' man, Jamie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), falling in love with his latest hookup, Maggie (played by Anne Hathaway).
