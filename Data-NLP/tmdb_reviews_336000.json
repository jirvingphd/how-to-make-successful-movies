One of sibling who is close to her father, realises what's going on in the family and tries to find a solution to it.

True stories always reach my heart. This was just like I wanted. Enjoyed every bit of it, especially performances were top notch. One of the highlights was Ella Anderson. Find of the film, despite she has done other decent roles prior to it. Brie's not a great actress, but her choice of films always was the best, hence her part too was good in this.\r\n\r\nSecond feature film for the director, as well as with Brie. He was good though. Not to say anything about Harrelson, one of the under-rated actors of our generation. He should get the Oscar nominee for this role, but that's very unlikely I think.

Definitely one of the best of the year that must not be missed.\r\n\r\n_8/10_", "created_at": "2018-02-04T14:43:44.072Z"}, {"movie_id": 336000, "review_id": "5a771c20c3a3686b5101f682", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "**The story of a Mountain Goat!**\r\n\r\nThis was like a combination of 'Captain Fantastic' and 'Infinitely Polar Bear'.
