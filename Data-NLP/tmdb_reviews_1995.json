With a perfect lead actress and a director known for wild action films, Tomb Raider was brought to life in one of the most faithful video game adaptations ever made (for better or worse). This movie brought the 2000s-era Tomb Raider games to life with all the style and camp of the decade - Matrix glasses, grunge rock, mediocre computer effects, and over-the-top action. While it wasn't a mind-blowing epic, it was a fun ride that captured some of the Indians Jones meets James Bond style of the games. Angelina Jolie was born to play this role and nailed the look and strength of Lara Croft and looked like she had a blast doing it too. Throw in Daniel Craig before he was Bond and every video game movie's villain, Ian Glen, and you got yourself a ridiculous 2000s action flick that nails the Tomb Raider spirit of that time. With the same vibe and effects of the Resident Evil movie franchise, Tomb Raider has flaws, but it's still a lot of fun.
