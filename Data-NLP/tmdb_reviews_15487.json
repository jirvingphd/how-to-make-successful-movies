One of Disney's best live-action offerings up until 2005.\r\n\r\nIt's yet another sports drama from the studio, one of many still to come too, but it's a cut above their previous live-actions releases in this subgenre; even beating 2002's <em>'The Rookie'</em>, which I like tremendously.\r\n\r\nI love every detail of <em>'The Greatest Game Ever Played'</em>, which is about a true story. The score is splendid, the cinematography is excellent and the premise is riveting - even to someone like me who isn't a follower of golf. There are a few scenes that use effects, namely with Vardon, which look neat.\r\n\r\nVardon is portrayed by Stephen Dillane, who is terrific in the role. Stephen Marcus plays Ted Ray, he's another top performer as is Josh Flitter (Eddie) - the latter brings some amusing humour to events.\r\n\r\nThe film's star, however, is Shia LaBeouf. He does a grand job as Ouimet, he produces the goods in all of his scenes. I'm already a fan of LaBeouf's, so I'm glad I can add another one of his characters to my memory.\r\n\r\nThis did not feel like a 120 minute production. Great pacing, great film. Highly recommended!", "created_at": "2020-11-03T19:33:45.139Z"}, {"movie_id": 15487, "review_id": "5fa1b0995a5ed000364d0c38", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "Superb!
