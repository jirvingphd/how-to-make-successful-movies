And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again.

Russell Crowe is the eponymous soldier \"Maximus\". Commander of the Armies of the Rhine for Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his designated successor - until, that is, the emperor's son \"Commodus\" (Joaquin Phoenix) and his sister \"Lucilla\" (an efficient Connie Nielsen) arrive and suddenly it's all change at the top. Betrayed and left for dead, our hero must now make other shifts if he is to survive in his new world - controlled by slave-owning \"Proximo\" (Oliver Reed) and deliver him of vengeance on his new Imperial nemesis. The film looks great, the cast - including some some strong supporting efforts from Sir Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Djimon Hounsou and Tomas Arana all contribute well to this grandeur of this historical saga. The high politics, betrayal and duplicity are matched with a sense of integrity and camaraderie as \"Maximus\" begins to galvanise his colleagues and his political allies into something more than a disparate band fighting just to survive each day. Reed and Harris both feature only sparingly, but both add a richness to the characterisations that are dominated by two on-form performances from Crowe and Phoenix that epitomise a struggle of good versus evil and ultimate power in an empire where corruption and brutality trade human life as if it were a watermelon. Add to this some superb visual effects and a rousing score from Hans Zimmer (and Lisa Gerrard) and we have a compelling watch on a big screen that shows there is still a glimmer of the Cecil B. De Mille spirit left in Hollywood.", "created_at": "2023-04-18T10:41:47.530Z"}, {"movie_id": 98, "review_id": "650a52189661fc01ed692548", "author_rating": 10.0, "review_text": "\"Gladiator,\" directed by Ridley Scott and released in 2000, is undeniably one of the best movies ever made. A cinematic masterpiece that effortlessly blends action, drama, and history, this film leaves an indelible mark on all who watch it.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of \"Gladiator\" are the remarkable performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe's portrayal of Maximus Decimus Meridius is nothing short of breathtaking. His stoic determination, unwavering loyalty, and charismatic presence make him the perfect embodiment of a hero. Joaquin Phoenix, on the other hand, delivers a chillingly convincing performance as the treacherous Commodus. His portrayal of the power-hungry and morally bankrupt emperor is both mesmerizing and repulsive, showcasing his exceptional acting prowess.\r\n\r\nWhat sets \"Gladiator\" apart from other films is its ability to evoke genuine emotions. The story of Maximus, a loyal general who seeks revenge for the murder of his family and the betrayal of his emperor, touches the very core of our humanity. The film explores themes of honor, justice, and the indomitable spirit of the human soul, making it a truly timeless narrative.\r\n\r\nI would rewatch it anytime and recommend it to anyone. It's a solid 10/10, truly an amazing masterpiece.", "created_at": "2023-09-20T01:59:52.629Z"}]
