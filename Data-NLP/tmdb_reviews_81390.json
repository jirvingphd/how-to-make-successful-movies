A group of mountain climbers stumble upon a girl hidden underground by kidnappers in the middle of nowhere. They rescue her but not without the kidnappers tracking them down for the remainder of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie is quite violent with numerous homicides and has some very disturbing scenes such as a man unsuccessfully begging and pleading for his life and another death involving mountain climbing. The always charming Melissa George helps carry this movie but everyone plays their parts well. I give the movie a 6/10.", "created_at": "2017-11-05T02:34:37.358Z"}]
