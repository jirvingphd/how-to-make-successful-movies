I felt that the story was copied from lots of Malayalam movies such as Kammatti Paadam, for example the narration part the way the movie starts making up gangs picking up fights then the 2 way love from premam and many movies like that plus to mention the foodies scenes shown in the movie seen a lot like that in salt and pepper and ustad hotel and many more. This movie was trying to bring a new slang into the Malayalam industry for me it felt as the worst slang ever nothing is clear to understand. Each scene ends in cursing and total violence it\u2019s not good for family audience. But I was able to learn that we could make 4 cores by just selling pork if that was the scene the whole of Kerala would have sold pork and got rich makes no sense. Don\u2019t know how this movie was a hit in the Malayalam movie industry it was complete nonsense and filled with lots of garbage. It was a mixture of lots of Malayalam movies they just wanted to fill up the given movie time with garbage that\u2019s all.
