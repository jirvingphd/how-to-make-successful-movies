My point is, this film is for women and maybe that including the gays. Being a straight male, I find it's not fun or entertaining, but I felt it pulled me further away as the movie progressed without balancing the content as a product for everyone.\r\n\r\nI know, no one asked my opinion. I respect the movie, at least it aimed for a certain section of the audiences. The road trip was fine to me, except the music and the dance parts. Thankfully, there's no nudity, except once, but still an R rated movie for strong sexual appeal.\r\n\r\nWhatever the theme was about, I expected a good story. But it was a lot like a documentary. No focus on any particular characters, but Channing Tatum was in a prime position. No development either in the story other than a group that embark a road trip to participate in a competition. Nothing anything like the first film, kind of detached from afar.\r\n\r\nSo I won't expect you to feel as the way I did on this, but you could consider my points and can judge whether want to watch it. Still, I'm not suggesting to boycott the film. I'm neutral, and all I'm saying is that it did not impress me, but it might you, especially if you are a woman.\r\n\r\n4/10", "created_at": "2016-01-14T13:41:31.443Z"}, {"movie_id": 264999, "review_id": "5697a58b92514154d20022e9", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "> Just not my cup of tea.\r\n\r\nI have seen the first part and I don't remember I felt the same way as I did for this.
