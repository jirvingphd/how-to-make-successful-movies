[{"movie_id": 308504, "review_id": "574374dac3a3685c3200004b", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "> When the knights rise after the fall of their master.\r\n\r\nI had a feeling that I know this story from somewhere else like a deja-vu, but more than that I felt it should have been a ninja story than the knight's. So when I checked the crew list and I found the Japanese director who made 'Goemon'. That's not at all, it was indeed a version of the Japanese classical hit 'The Loyal 47 Ronin'. Honestly, I haven't seen that, but have seen the other versions like the Keanu Reeve's recent '47 Ronon' et cetera.\r\n\r\nIt was the story of a group of knights led by Raiden played by Clive Owen. After their master was tricked to death by a corrupted minister in the court of law, everyone thinks the knights would avenge for it. But that does not happen and as the years pass, slowly the hope fades away. And then comes a twist with some good action sequences before the end credits roll up.\r\n\r\nIt was a great story, but the transforming it from a ninja tale to a knight's did not give that solid revenge seeking effect. Because the ninja fights are kind of stylish, because the stunt choreography and costumes for ninjas has changed in the present scenario. Whereas the knight's remained same for the decades, that means it was a very normal like a medieval European sword fight. So you can call it a realistic, yet there's a filmy thing which lacks in it.\r\n\r\nThat's fine because the entire film was almost a slow drama. So don't assume it is a complete action film. In that perspective, it will definitely disappoint a few viewers, but I think it is still worth giving a try. The cast and the production were awesome, but still there's something is holding back it to the B movies list than an A. And finally, seeing the way it ended, I think there will be another film to follow.\r\n\r\n6/10", "created_at": "2016-05-23T21:23:38.683Z"}]
