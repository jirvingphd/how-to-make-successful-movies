They actually worked very well together, perfect casting. I found Rob Lowe amusing in this, not sure if I was supposed to but I did - not in a negative way in regards to Lowe, just the character of Dr. Jack Startz. Debbie Reynolds (Frances) and Dan Aykroyd (Seymour) also appear, two well-known people playing relatively small roles.\r\n\r\nThe film looks great, it perhaps lasts a little too long when all is said and done but it didn't hamper my enjoyment all that much. <em>'Behind the Candelabra'</em> is a very good biopic.", "created_at": "2020-08-11T14:10:20.902Z"}]
