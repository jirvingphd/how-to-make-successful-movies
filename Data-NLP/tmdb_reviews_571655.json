When Thor (Roland M\u00f8ller) and Loki (Dulfi Al-Jabouri) stop by the remote farm of \"R\u00f8skva\" (Cecilia Loffredo) and her elder brother Tjalfe (Saxo Molyke-Leth) for some supper, the young boy is encouraged to try out bone marrow by his more mischievous guest, much to the chagrin of \"Thor\" who insists that the boy serve them in Valhalla. Not to be left behind, his sister joins her sibling and they embark on some adventures involving the giant wolf \"Fenrir\" and their enemies - the giant people, the Jotnar. Norse mythology is fascinatingly interesting. Rich pickings for anyone who knows how to turn an adventure story, and to be fair to the kids and to director Denar Ahmad, they make a decent stab at this. No, the characterisations are not very substantial, but the production standards are high; there is plenty of action and beautiful scenery. The effects are cleverly interwoven with the scenarios and it pays enough of a nod to it's fantasy basis to keep it enjoyable.", "created_at": "2022-03-28T10:14:00.116Z"}]
