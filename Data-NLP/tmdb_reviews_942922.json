It's all a bit, well, bitty - too episodic. It doesn't really flow. We know these folks have all the awards known to man on their mantelpieces, but somehow there is actually rather little star quality on display here. I just didn't think they gelled well at all and there are stereotypes galore as it becomes gradually cheesier and sentimental. It passes ninety minutes OK, but it's not really a cinema film.
