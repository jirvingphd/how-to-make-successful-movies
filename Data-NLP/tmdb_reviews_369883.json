The film was based on the book of the same name and the first one of I think in the nine book series. It tells the story of a middle school boy who transferred to a new school. Having no friends, straight he falls prey to a bully. Beyond that, the principal turns his life in the campus even harder with all his strict rules.

Those interfering animations resemble that film. It's like a normal protocol in these days children film, so no complaint on that. But I'm very impressed with the quality. This film was too childish. I mean there's nothing wrong for the kids watching it, they will enjoy it. But for the adults, who had seen lots of middle school themed films of the 80s and the 90s, so it might look an average one. A good film for families with young kids. I particularly suggest to the such category audience.\r\n\r\nThe twist was unexpected. It was easy, but I did not go deep to predict that. I think most of you all too fail to see it coming. Particularly in a film like this who would think of it. That was not enough for me to like the overall film. It is entertaining in parts, but an average film from the inside and outside. Even though I hope they would turn the remaining books as well into the films. All these words I wrote in this review because of I'm being a non- target-audience. So if you are a kid or kid's film fan, ignore my saying and watch the film.\r\n\r\n_6/10_", "created_at": "2017-02-24T20:24:28.757Z"}, {"movie_id": 369883, "review_id": "58b0967cc3a368236d00026f", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "**New school, new beginning and a new set of rules to adapt.
