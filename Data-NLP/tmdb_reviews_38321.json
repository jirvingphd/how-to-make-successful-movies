It\u2019s a future/alternate reality kind of apocalyptic action/horror movie. Fairly simple and straightforward plot where the good guys stays pretty much stays as the good guys throughout the move and the hero is really someone that kicks ass throughout the movie. No bloody fussing around with making the hero \u201chuman\u201d or some crap like that.\n\nThe special effects and the apocalyptic sceneries where well done. In general the film was a solid piece of work. The transfer to Blu-ray equally well done. Picture quality was as to be expected and the DTS Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack well balanced with just enough surround effects and LFE to make it very enjoyable.\n\nThe film get a 5.7 rating at IMDB which in my mind is a bit on the low side but then, it\u2019s not really a film for everyone. The so called \u201ccritics\u201d at Rotten Tomatoes gave it 17% which is just pure bullshit but then I have given up on those idiots a long time ago.
