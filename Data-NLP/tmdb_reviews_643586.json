This film is one that feels like it\u2019s made expressly for fans of the horror-comedy genre, and its terrific premise, badass hero, and throwback grindhouse sentiment check all the boxes for a successful journey to becoming a midnight cult classic.\r\n\r\nA quiet loner (Nicolas Cage) becomes stranded in a remote town when his car breaks down. Unable to pay for the needed repairs, he agrees to spend the night cleaning up the local abandoned family fun center known as Willy\u2019s Wonderland. Little does he know that he has just signed up to be the janitor for a place believed to be haunted. Things haven\u2019t been the same since the rumors about missing children (and evil animatronics) took over the town. As the night progresses, the man discovers that the life-sized fuzzy mascots have minds of their own, and he must fight to the death in order to survive to see the sun rise.\r\n\r\nThe story is solid all around and if you suspend disbelief, the plot is actually plausible. There are supernatural elements and lots of humor, and the Janitor is the horror hero we didn\u2019t know we needed. Kevin Lewis has a terrific eye for direction, a natural at knowing exactly what the audience wants to see and how they want to see it (and delivering just that). The pacing is excellent, too. The film ends with a set-up for an eventual sequel that I really, really hope happens.\r\n\r\nThe most appropriate word I can find to describe this movie, and one that fits in almost any discussion of the film, is \u201crad.\u201d The awesome, primitive puppet costumes for Willy the Weasel and his tribe of murderous pals (Tito the Turtle, Siren Sara, Ozzie the Ostrich, and Knighty Knight, to name a few) are absolutely hysterical, the perfect pair for the equally amusing low budget horror effects. Even better is Cage, who brings that certain je ne sais quoi to his character, a soda-guzzling, pinball-loving man of few words (the actor doesn\u2019t speak any dialogue in the movie).\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a movie that you\u2019re supposed to take seriously, and that\u2019s what adds to its charm. \u201cWilly\u2019s Wonderland\u201d is tons of bloody fun, especially if you want to watch Nic Cage beat the shit out of possessed serial killer animatronics. And quite frankly, isn\u2019t that all of us?", "created_at": "2021-03-09T15:38:11.269Z"}]
