The two of them quickfire dialogue in true Sorkin fashion, and while _Molly's Game_ will probably not top anybody's lists for 2017, I do think most people will at the very least gain something from the movie, be it insight or enjoyment. Hopefully? Both.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2018-03-11T02:24:36.868Z"}, {"movie_id": 396371, "review_id": "630017cc3e6f2b007a9d6fde", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "**Overall : Fantastic performances and excellent writing further enhance an absolutely fascinating true story.**\r\n\r\nBased on the intriguing true story of Molly Bloom, an Olympic athlete turned underground poker organizer. The story in and of itself is fascinating, but it\u2019s accentuated even further with Chastain\u2019s incredible portrayal, the fantastic fast pace of the story, and Sorkin\u2019s clever script. Taking the time to Google and discover who each of these characters really were makes this compelling tale all the more riveting. Add Molly\u2019s uncompromising code and sprinkle in some Kevin Costner and Idris Elba and you end up with a gripping biopic that you can\u2019t believe is actually true!", "created_at": "2022-08-19T23:07:56.394Z"}]
