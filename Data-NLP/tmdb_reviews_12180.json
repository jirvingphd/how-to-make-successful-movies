A lot of the lines were confronting-ly bad. Otherwise, I found it inoffensive. Perhaps my lowered expectations and non-theatrical experience is the reason for this.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._", "created_at": "2020-05-19T06:55:31.685Z"}]
