This isn\u2019t a case of a movie that\u2019s so bad it\u2019s good, it actually is good.\r\n\r\nWhile it may seem like there isn\u2019t a lot here to separate the film from other exorcism stories (especially when there are several scenes of priests reciting prayers while brandishing crosses at a child who, possessed by a demon, is screaming obscenities in a growling voice), the depth of the storytelling is what makes a huge difference.

All of the standard elements are present here, but director Julius Avery\u2018s film surprisingly offers a refreshing (if somewhat routine) take on the religious horror subgenre.\r\n\r\nElevated by a well thought-out story and an engaging performance from Russell Crowe, the film tells the story of Father Gabriele Amorth (Crowe), Chief Exorcist of the Vatican (and one of the most controversial figures in the Church\u2019s modern era). The script is inspired by the Father\u2019s actual files of his time spent conducting exorcisms for the Catholic Church, which is enough to make your skin crawl.\r\n\r\nThe movie follows Father Amorth as he travels to Spain to investigate a young boy\u2019s (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) possession by a powerful demon. Aided by local priest Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto), Father Amorth tries to help the child before it\u2019s too late. In the process, he uncovers a centuries-old conspiracy that the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a really great story, and one that feels more plausible than other religious horror fantasies about supernatural possessions. (You know what I mean). There are solid scares, bloody violence, and creepy imagery that are all done quite well. It\u2019s slightly goofy but played with sincerity, which is why the film never teeters on the edge of camp. This isn\u2019t a case of a movie that\u2019s so bad it\u2019s good, it actually is good.\r\n\r\nWhile it may seem like there isn\u2019t a lot here to separate the film from other exorcism stories (especially when there are several scenes of priests reciting prayers while brandishing crosses at a child who, possessed by a demon, is screaming obscenities in a growling voice), the depth of the storytelling is what makes a huge difference. Every element clicks in unison here, from the screenplay to the direction to the better than expected performances.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Pope\u2019s Exorcist\u201d is the type of movie that should be forgettable, but isn\u2019t. I actually enjoyed it because it overdelivers on what it promises, and is a lot better than you\u2019d expect.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the movie, I literally starting thinking, \u201cwow, Crowe and Zovatto should star in future installments as ass-kicking priest sidekicks,\u201d and bam! The film went ahead and set itself up for a sequel: 199 of them, to be exact. As batty as this sounds, I would \u2014 pun intended \u2014 watch the hell out of that.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "created_at": "2023-04-23T06:00:33.213Z"}, {"movie_id": 758323, "review_id": "645a2812fe077a5cadf6350f", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "Its actually a great movie like it trun into a bit dark one in the end\r\n", "created_at": "2023-05-09T11:01:38.172Z"}, {"movie_id": 758323, "review_id": "6463a7f00f36550170b3bb9c", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed The Pope's Exorcist. After initially seeing the trailers, I wrote this movie off as a standard possession film that I have seen time and time again, and while most of that is still true, there is something about this film that made it a joy to watch.\r\n\r\nThe film does not attempt to do anything particularly new or groundbreaking in the genre, but everything it has is handled with care and precision. The direction is fantastic, with a very quick pace that makes each scene have a sense of urgency as our characters attempt to perform the exorcism. There is particularly deep lore that is established within the church structure, with different factions and politics at play that add a slightly different dimension rather than just your run-of-the-mill \"insert random priest here.\"\r\n\r\nMy favorite aspect of the film is the acting. I think all of the adult characters do a tremendous job here. Russell Crowe kills it in every scene he is in and definitely gives an entirely different take on the exorcist character. Where most are intensely serious and melodramatic, Crowe adds a bit of whimsicalness and youth to the character that creates a calming presence to every intense scene. His rapport with Daniel Zovatto is excellent. The two really play off each other well and carried the film in many ways. Alex Essoe was great, although underutilized. The two children were okay. The boy gave a very stereotypical portrayal of a possessed child, and the daughter was flat in many ways.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint about the entire film is its lack of originality and the story. Every single beat is something that we have seen before; there were no new or fresh ideas that were interjected into the story. The tension was fine, but nothing was particularly scary. Overall, if not for the film's fantastic director and cast, it would have been a bomb.\r\n\r\nScore: 63% \ud83d\udc4d\r\nVerdict: Decent", "created_at": "2023-05-16T15:57:36.310Z"}, {"movie_id": 758323, "review_id": "652c95c1024ec8011e343de3", "author_rating": 1.0, "review_text": "An episode of supernatural would've done a better job.
