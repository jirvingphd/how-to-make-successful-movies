It portrays, with extra drama I'm sure, the events of Morris' real life baseball career in a fantastic way. There's great character development right from the get-go, by the conclusion I was utterly invested in Morris. He is played by Dennis Quaid, who is superb in the role. I felt every emotion of his character, best I've (currently) seen of Quaid so far.\r\n\r\nThe film does a great job at making you care for not only him, but even his high school team. Speaking of which, they did a terrific job with the casting of those guys - I felt like I was watching a bunch of real teammates; Chad Lindberg, of <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em>, is one of them. Even away from Quaid and Lindberg & Co., you still have Morris' family to feel for as well. There's many characters to get attached to, but I was very interested in all of them.\r\n\r\nFantastic stuff, I'd highly recommend you watch <em>'The Rookie'</em>.", "created_at": "2020-10-14T02:36:27.286Z"}]
