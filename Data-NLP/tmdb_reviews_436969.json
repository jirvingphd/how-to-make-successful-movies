And they LITERALLY killed off the first team at the very start of the film! To be honest, I wasn't really surprised as I didn't see more of them in later scenes of the trailer. But I was surprised they killed off Captain Boomerang - he was basically the primary member of the team!

They are looking to please the American government to gain some favour in return. However, some of them will surprise us with some good intentions and actions.It\u2019s an exciting movie, spectacular in its genre and filled with dark humour and great character.

However, a recent coup overthrew the friendly American government and, the task forces created by intelligence officer Amanda Waller needs to destroy the laboratory of the secret experiment, J\u00f6tunheim. Colonel Rick Flag leads the first team that tries to enter the Corto Maltese\u2019s beach. At the same time, the second team leader is Bloodsport, an assassin who accepted the mission under the blackmail of the American authorities. Both teams will have to strive and survive to accomplish the critical goal.\r\n\r\nOur heroes, or villains, needs to save the world from \u201cStarro The Conqueror\u201d, a dangerous weapon in the hands of the not trustable Corto Maltese\u2019s government.

It is over the top crazy, weird and outrageous. It is also incredibly gory. It is a super hero / bad guy comedy with emphasis on comedy. I was thinking comedy version of Kill Bill (for the gore and killing) with supers in it when I was watching it.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I enjoyed watching it though.\r\n\r\nThe movie makes absolutely no pretense of being taken seriously. The \u201cheros\u201d are outrageously wacky and so are most normal persons in the movie. The plot is just as wacky as the characters and this is a movie in which the normal ludicrous and illogical plot twists that the Hollywood hacks usually comes up with actually feels right for the movie.\r\n\r\nI got a bit of a what the f\u2026 moment at the beginning when the movie had but started and everything went to hell right away. That was before I had realized how much of a comedy this movie really was supposed to be. If there is a sane moment in this movie I missed it.\r\n\r\nIf there was one thing I didn\u2019t like about the movie it was the liberal use of jumping back and forth. I hate this \u201c24 hours earlier\u2026\u201d bullshit or any permutations thereof.\r\n\r\nI also really didn\u2019t like the \u201cIt\u2019s the evil US government conducting illegal evil experiments and we\u2019re supposed to cover it up\u201d story line. It just typical Hollywood overused crap.\r\n\r\nI did like the action though. As I wrote before it is ridiculously gory and very very comical. So is a lot of the dialog which of course is as crazy and weird as the rest of the movie. In any other movie as large shark with legs walking on land saying \u201cyum yum\u201d and then eating someone, repeatedly, would be just cringeworthy. In this movie it actually works.\r\n\r\nThe movie is 2 hours 12 minutes long and it really did not feel too long. It was 2+ hours of fun entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe post credit scene was a bit lame though.

James Gunn is such a fantastically creative director, and it is shown in full force here. Gunn is able to give each character their own artistic flair that makes even the most ridiculous characters (Polka-Dot Man) memorable. The comedy is on point, like most Gunn films, but there is a more brutal style of humor that is distinctly different the MCU humor that he has pioneered, given the R rating. I was pleased with the fighting choreography, with many unique kills i.e, the Harley Quinn escape scene. The plot is nothing special, but that is really in the background to the characters relationships that build throughout the course of the film.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_", "created_at": "2022-06-30T19:30:45.444Z"}, {"movie_id": 436969, "review_id": "630fa1ba0231f20091be3163", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Movie is different in terms of the violence it handles, but I feel that it falls into many things previously seen.

Et-fucking-cetera.\r\n\r\nThese minor differences only serve to emphasize that the only real difference between this movie and its predecessor is a definite article in the title. Even the quote-unquote new characters serve to preserve the status quo, as their introduction allows writer/director James Gunn to repeat David Ayer's formula from the first film: Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who is clearly a bigger sociopath than any member of the Suicide Squad, scrapes the bottom of the DC barrel for characters who go from feeling sorry for themselves to feeling sorry for each other.\r\n\r\nBut there is something that The Suicide Squad has that Suicide Squad doesn't: an odd habit of unnecessarily doubling down. Thus, we have Peacemaker, who is interchangeable with Bloodsport does. Or Weasel, a humanoid weasel who is interchangeable with Pete Davidson, a weasely human (Davidson is possibly the only person more annoying than Margot Robbie; thankfully, his character gets his face shot off early on, which actually makes Davidson less grotesque to look at than usual).", "created_at": "2022-09-03T16:46:19.270Z"}, {"movie_id": 436969, "review_id": "632b9be43520e80082a392dd", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "I certainly could have tolerated a LOT more comedic lines.

James Gunn introduces the audience to a whole cadre of characters that are very deep cuts into DC lore with unknowns like Polka-dot Man, Peacemaker, Bloodsport, Ratcatcher, Javelin, and more. These obscure villains serve as perfect cannon fodder for Amanda Waller's hopeless suicide missions. These C-list villains almost scream that no one is safe. Both new and old characters constantly die throughout the film. Still, somehow Gunn manages to make us care about these obscure and insignificant comic book characters making their deaths more potent and heartbreaking. He also knows how to direct Harley Quinn better than any director who has brought the character to live action. Her insanity and charm are delightfully deranged and perfectly showcased repeatedly. With an army of bad guys, there is plenty of action and fighting to keep the runtime moving and put each squad member's skills on display. After what Gunn did with The Suicide Squad, I am excited to see what he brings to the rest of the DC Universe.", "created_at": "2023-02-11T05:54:27.203Z"}]
