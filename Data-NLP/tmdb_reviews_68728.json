Sadly, though, we must watch the first hundred to get there, and they are not so good. \"Diggs\" (James Franco) is a jobbing, pretty unpleasant, magician doing the provincial shows when he and his balloon get caught up in a storm and next thing, he is in an unknown land where pretty soon he befriends a winged ape, a porcelain doll and is on the path to great riches in the \"Emerald City\". Upon arrival, acclaiming himself this great wizard, he meets three sisters who are a darned sight better with their wands - and he is soon a pawn in their game for control over \"Oz\". Can he thwart their machinations and save the city from their scheme? There is a narrative here - it's about \"Diggs\" discovering his inner decency, but it all just takes an age to get anywhere. Franco is adequate, but no better, and there three witches - Rachel Weisz, Mila Kunis and the nice one we recall from the original film \"Glinda\" (Michelle Williams) are oddly sterile with their efforts.
