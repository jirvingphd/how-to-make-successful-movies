Regrettably, it\u2019s the least of these. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the cast or technical filmmaking as the gore, F/X and swamp sets are fine, although the \u2018monster\u2019 make-up looks kinda cartoonish (which fits the genre).\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s relatively amusing and occasionally funny, it\u2019s hindered by an odious raunchy air right out of the gate. For instance, the two supposedly hot girls flash their breasts every 5 minutes in the first half hour. Don\u2019t take that as prudish, I\u2019m just pointing out that a movie is questionable when it goes overboard with female nudity to hide its deficiencies. Meanwhile the heroine played by Amara Zaragoza is interesting, but she has little sex appeal, although that\u2019s a matter of taste.\r\n\r\nI could handle those flaws if the story was more compelling and the humor more amusing, yet that\u2019s not the case. Although the plot is great, the script needed a rewrite to flesh out better prospects. But that takes time & money and the flick only cost 1.5 million, which is almost six times LESS than what \u201cClub Dread\u201d cost.\r\n\r\nI should add that Kane Hodder plays the Jason-like antagonist while Robert Englund has a cameo in the opening.     \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, with a longer version running an additional 9 minutes. It was shot in New Orleans (Mardi Gras sequences) with the swamp scenes done in a convincing indoor set at Sable Ranch, Santa Clarita, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-/D+", "created_at": "2021-05-17T18:21:35.857Z"}]
