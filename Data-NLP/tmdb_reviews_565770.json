Now I'm hooked!\"\r\n\u2043 Some minutes after leaving the cinema: \"Ooohhhh........\"\r\n\r\nIn a few words, I didn't like it. Blue Beetle looks like a superhero origin combined with Iron Man, Venom, and Spider-Man, adding just a bit of the family dynamic from Encanto (or Fast & Furious, you decide).\r\n\r\nThe only outstanding thing is the cringe factor: strange jokes, graphics that are far from the best, and a derivative plot \u2014 everything looks like it was made in the 00s. It's not bad, really; sometimes, it's even good \u2014 you'll definitely giggle if you're into this style. However, it's not enough to label the movie as a good one.\r\n\r\nP.S. While watching this one, I've finally come up with the thought that I'm always bored during the first act. All these character introductions and exposition setups look like they're for people who are watching the first movie in their life. It doesn't matter if I like the film; I'm always waiting for the real action to begin \ud83d\ude41", "created_at": "2023-08-21T15:22:22.256Z"}, {"movie_id": 565770, "review_id": "64eefeaa27167100c6dc548e", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Maybe this should just have been called the \"Blue Bottle\" after the annoying blowfly that buzzes around annoyingly to no apparent purpose? Susan Sarandon (why?) is the megalomanic corporate mogul \"Kord\" who is out to create a super-soldier (\"OMAC\") using an extra-terrestrial scarab that can synergise an human being with an almost indestructible endo-skeleton. Fortunately for all of us, her cleaning lady likes to use the luxury bathroom at her home, and when she is caught and quite literally dumped, she and her brother find themselves out of work and introduced to \"Jenny\" (Bruna Marquezine) - the strong-minded niece of our baddie - who is determined to thwart the militarisation of her daddy's company.  She smuggles the gadget out of their HQ and manages to pass it to the rather earnest and drippy brother \"Jaime\" (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a) with strict instructions not to even open the box. Of course they do, and next thing he and the glowing blue gizmo are best mates - he can fly, zip around with great speed and has, of course, super-human strength. \"Cord\" is determined to get it back, so she energises her already semi-mechanised henchman \"Carapax\" (Raoul Max Trujillo) for a gradual/glacial build up to a denouement that a bat could see from space. This has all the feel to it of a standard television movie. Great visual effects but lightning pyrotechnics, cleaving a bus in half and endless explosions are no longer enough to sell a film. There has to be some semblance of originality with the thing. Aside from it's bilinguality, this has precious little by way of innovation to shout for it. The characters are largely forgettable - especially the annoying uncle \"Rudy\" (George Lopez) who's astonishing adeptness with all things super-tech was just plain daft! It's also way, way too long and I felt the ominous presence of a sequel looming at the end quite sad. This is a weak story with a weak cast that seems designed to fill a gap in the USA's expanding and under-served Hispanic market. I think it may work there? I'm not so sure anyone else needs this.", "created_at": "2023-08-30T08:32:42.679Z"}, {"movie_id": 565770, "review_id": "650ab8816c19ea00adec84f5", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Blue beetle is very awesome!!

It has the message, but it isn't screamed at you at the top of it's lungs like most movies are these days.  In fact, it's so subtle that it's not even much of a distraction.  \r\n\r\nNot that it doesn't have it's distractions.  It has the same \"because the plot needs it\" occurrences that make you roll your eyes that seem to plague just about every movie these days... but even that is sort of muted.\r\n\r\nThe themes are fun and decent enough where you would actually want your kids to see it... and in the end it doesn't try to do anything new, it just attempts to make itself into a fun and enjoyable film.  That's really all I ask for in movies, especially these days.  I want to have fun at the box office again, and this movie delivers that.\r\n\r\nIt's just... you forgot it was even released didn't you?\r\nAnd you hardly ever heard of the character.  There was next to no publicity.  It wasn't really advertised, it came at a time when people were burned out from all the political super hero movies, and let's face it, everyone is sick of the huge CGI fight with the huge CGI villain/army.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end you had a bit of a flop, and an undeserving one at that, because the movie is fun, it does entertain, and it deserved more than it got.", "created_at": "2023-10-13T22:17:36.108Z"}, {"movie_id": 565770, "review_id": "655ad9c6f6787a00e30c2481", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "<em>'Blue Beetle'</em> won me over in the end.\r\n\r\nI wasn't personally convinced by it for large periods, not that I was finding it anything boring, irritating or anything close to that but I just wasn't really feeling the vibe. However, across the second half of the film I could feel myself gradually becoming more invested in the events onscreen.\r\n\r\nMuch of the cast match each other in terms of standard, they all try and subsequently produce solid displays. I will say that I really enjoyed George Lopez's performance as Rudy, he brings a lot of life and humour to the film via that role.\r\n\r\nXolo Maridue\u00f1a is more than decent as the titular character, while Bruna Marquezine makes for a good match alongside Maridue\u00f1a; even if her character's Kord family portion of the story didn't interest me as much as the Reyes', in that sense the less said about Susan Sarandon the better here - extremely meh, at best.\r\n\r\nI very much wouldn't say the filmmakers hit the ball out of the park with this 2023 release, but I can certainly see potential with the character going forward - given they are reportedly planning to continue with him within the DCU.
