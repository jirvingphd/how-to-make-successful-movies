I've sat through plenty of \"chick flicks\" but even by chick flick standards this one is just horrible. (to give this a more modern reference, I rate this one below \"The Vow\" on the painful to watch scale. If The Vow is a broken femur, Dr. T and the Women is everlasting torment in the 9th circle of Hell.) \r\n\r\nI try to look for the good in any movie, and I have plenty of low budget favorites as well as many Hollywood, blockbuster favorites.  I've actually seen Dr. T. and the Women, movie on people's \"Favorites\" lists and I scratch my head and the only conclusion I can come up with is that the people that made this movie and actually like this movie are infatuated with Richard Gere and he could just stand in front of a camera doing anything at random for 90 minutes and these persons would have a deep admiration of the film...  As a movie there is just nothing here. It is an absolute piece of c. I honestly believe that this movie could cause brain damage. Honestly I generally like Richard Gere movies, be they chick flick or not, but this is just an abomination. And if you absolutely have to see Helen Hunt in a \"B\" movie checkout Trancers. At least there is no pretense.", "created_at": "2012-06-05T22:32:13.000Z"}]
