However, I had liked watching the movie\u2026a lot!\r\n\r\nSure, the script is predictable and certainly wont win any prices for best script anywhere. The acting is adequate but no more. But it is a fun fantasy adventure movie, a simple adventure / action fantasy roller-coaster. Plenty of fairly cool special effects. Some humor, some romance. It is also fairly devoid of politically correct preaching, whining, mentally unstable and self destructive \u201cheroes\u201d and all that crap. In short it is the kind of movie I like.\r\n\r\nI actually looked up the movies page on Wikipedia and it was pretty much full of nonsense and whining about how the movie was not \u201cethnically correct\u201d. What the f\u2026? It is a bloody fantasy adventure movie for Christ sake! It is meant to entertain! Who the hell cares about whether the actors are native Egyptians or something else? Well, I guess Eskimos would look a bit funny in those roles but otherwise\u2026\r\n\r\nYes it does take quite a few liberties with Egyptian mythology but again, it is a fantasy movie guys! And Egyptian mythology, like any other mythology, goods etc, is nothing but fantasy and story telling from the start so just live with it. To me they stayed true enough to the core of the mythology and I would actually give the director and script writers bonus points for actually depicting the earth as flat as was the predominant belief in those times. Those scenes with Ra dragging the sun and the flat Earth was quite beautiful actually.\r\n\r\nThe rating on IMDb is also on the low side but of those that took the effort to write a review most seems to be quite positive. The mostly negative ones are, of course, the so called \u201ccritics\u201d. No surprise there.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to see how a, in my opinion a quite entertaining, movie can be so sabotaged by a bunch of, again in my opinion, loud mouthed, ignorant, intolerant, fanatical SJWs who seems to believe that a movie cannot be allowed to just entertain but has to carry a political message, their political message.\r\n\r\nI would recommend anyone into fantasy and adventure movies to check this one out if you should stumble upon it. I certainly do not regret adding it to my collection.", "created_at": "2018-07-23T09:05:29.352Z"}, {"movie_id": 205584, "review_id": "63bf4efd8efe730094887112", "author_rating": 1.0, "review_text": "I usually go for movies like this but.... whatever happened to practical effects? You lose me with too much blatant CGI. This movie, it seemed like it was only CGI.\r\n\r\nAnd not just CGI, but the kind of CGI that looks like a video game.\r\n\r\nIt honestly lost me right away, I gave it about ten minutes and just stopped.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T00:06:21.215Z"}]
