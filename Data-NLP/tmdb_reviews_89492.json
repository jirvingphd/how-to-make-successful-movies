I having nothing major against it tbh.\r\n\r\nThe cast are probably what stop me from disliking <em>'This Is 40'</em>. Paul Rudd (Pete) and Leslie Mann (Debbie) are likeable and more than competent in the lead roles, while John Lithgow (Oliver) and Albert Brooks (Larry) are strong additions to this <em>'Knocked Up'</em> spin-off.\r\n\r\nThe story features interesting stuff and has, just about, respectable intentions, but man is it overly long. They could've made the exact same point but with 30-40 minutes worth of fat cut out. I didn't care enough about the characters to see them for as long as I did, in short.\r\n\r\nAs alluded to, the onscreen talent do keep it bubbling along at a minimal level and, also, the music is very good. It just didn't need to be so dragged out, in my opinion.", "created_at": "2021-02-27T05:14:28.758Z"}]
