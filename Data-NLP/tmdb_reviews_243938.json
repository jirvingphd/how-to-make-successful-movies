Sadly, there are plenty that will be receptive to this lazy and raucous time-traveling tripe with the transparent titillation.\r\n\r\nHot Tub Time Travel Machine 2 (2015)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n93 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Rob Cordday, Craig Robinson, Clark Duke, Chevy Chase, Adam Scott and Collette Wolfe\r\n\r\nDirected by: Steve Pink\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy & Fantasy/Time Travel Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * star (out of 4 stars)", "created_at": "2015-10-11T07:59:47.207Z"}, {"movie_id": 243938, "review_id": "581cf33392514136140010fa", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "**Landing in a wrong timeline!**\r\n\r\nFeels like 2010 was a long ago, so I don't remember the first film much. Looks like it is an unnecessary sequel, particularly when a very important character goes missing. Even the first film was not great, though that was considered a mainstream film and this one slipped into the B category. An average story, the theme was not used properly. I'm not talking about the plot holes, but the story construction and its characters.\r\n\r\nThe old friends meet again after becoming famous and millionaires, but when one of them met an accident, they decide to go back in time to fix it. Instead, they enter a wrong timeline and from there how they get back is what revealed in the remaining narration. The comedies were okay types, but I expected a better one. The twist was very ordinary, for a time travel theme people anticipates a smart twist, but it fell short to stand up to the mark.\r\n\r\nWhatever, the production was awesome, all the special effects were acceptable. I mean it did not strongly relied on them, but according to the story's requirement, it managed so well. Less entertainment, but very much watchable and suits as a timepass product. I think the scenes at the end credits are for fun, but it also looks like a hint for possible third film. I'm not against that idea, but if it has a good story and upgraded cast like maybe new ones, I surely look forward.\r\n\r\n_4.5/10_", "created_at": "2016-11-04T20:44:35.273Z"}]
