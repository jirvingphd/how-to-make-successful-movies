Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.\r\n\r\nAt the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus\u2019s cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as \u201cCarnage\u201d.\r\n\r\nCletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.\r\n\r\nAs any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.\r\n\r\nThere have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.\r\n\r\nWhat we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.\r\n\r\nDirector Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.\r\n\r\nThe plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any \u201cwow\u201d moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.\r\n\r\nFor me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.\r\n\r\nFor now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5", "created_at": "2021-09-30T13:48:10.279Z"}, {"movie_id": 580489, "review_id": "616a1f77924ce6008d09fb70", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Let There be Carnage!\r\n\r\nIt is a not bad movie to watch.

How I wish more people would only appreciate how **( -Incredibly- )** difficult it is to emote for two -very- different entities, -near- simultaneously, that exist within just -{ ONE SINGLE }- body. 3 : Venom's \"Mardi-Gras Themed Nightclub Scene\".

So here is perhaps -{ The }- most significant reason for -Why- that was the case, in my best estimation. Tom Hardy and Kelly Marcel, V2's storywriters . . . . -{ collectively }- lacked the requisite experience to rise to the indubitably -gargantuan- task of ( -Adequately- ) enthralling a whole -Planet- ; one that has now become -Altogether- used to watching 'PHENOMENALLY' entertaining Marvel fare, and there's really no other way to say it. Tom, ( whom I 'Admire To Death' as a -performer- , I definitely ought to point out here ), had only two\u270c **-STORY-** writing credits to his name prior to V2 , with Kelly logging just three\ud83d\udc4c . . . { counting 'Individual' TV Series, but -Not- counting 'Shorts' ( short films ), of course }. 3 : A \" MASSIVE \" Missed Opportunity : It is -indeed- not all that often that we see a quintessential 'Popcorn-blockbuster' flick make a -significant- effort to -Humanize- the villain by way of their -{ Early Childhood Experiences }- , no matter -how- evil they nay be shown as being.

I still love the character.  Venom is the quintissential anti-hero.  Once a bad guy (though not in this universe apparently) he now tries to do the right thing while keeping within acceptable norms to exist among humans.  \r\nThis movie was a good attempt but, it came across as contrived and a bit cookie cutter as far as the bad guys, Woody Harrelson and Naomi Harris, were portrayed.  Psychoes enjoying newfound freedom after a fail death sentence, and lifelong incarceration is soooooo....bland.  In short, \"It's been done (before).\"  \r\n\r\nThe story from there is hit 'n miss with comedy, plot, and tension.  The movie pretty much happens in that manner as well.  It jumps as if each of the scenes are little movies banded together with no smooth transitions : Hardy really needs to workout or pass the character to someone else; his age is showing.  Harrelson and Harris' characters really didn't mesh, the half deaf cop never really fit into the story, we didn't hear enough from Carnage, and Venom's night out didn't actually go anywhere.  \r\n\r\nThe vibe of the movie felt clunky.\r\n\r\nI'll always like Venom.  But this was not particularly thrilling.  There is mixed opinion on which of the two movies is better.  I'll have to fall into the camp of those who liked the first Venom movie.  The second, more than not, simply let me down.

The entertaining elements from the first film, the humour and - dare I say it, the symbiotic relationship/tolerance of man and amoeba are thrown under the bus for this angry CGI fest. Add to this pretty dry mix the rather pointless character of Harrelson's childhood sweetheart \"Frances\" (Naomie Harris) alias \"the Scream\" (remember the symbiotes don't like fire of sound), with her own agenda against copper \"Mulligan\" (Stephen Graham) and the whole thing just boils down to a very good looking film - but one with a plot that was almost non-existent, and that robbed the formidably sarcastic \"Venom\" of much of the charm that made the original work.
