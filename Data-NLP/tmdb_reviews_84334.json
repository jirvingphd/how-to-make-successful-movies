It's about a singer from the 70s whom I've never heard of (although I'm old enough) even though he's clearly a better poet and songwriter than Bob Dylan (yes, I said that and I'm a poet so there's my credentials). If you know anything about the record industry, and about the reality of discrimination in the United States, then it's easy to understand how a Mexican singer/song writer of the 70s was ignored by the payola controlled DJs of the time and screwed by the record industry. The low-budget film itself is full of surprises, and the culmination of the search for Sugar Man is totally uplifting and heartwarming. If you love the music genre, this film is a must see - even if it's only for the delicious sound track.", "created_at": "2022-09-10T22:27:17.737Z"}, {"movie_id": 84334, "review_id": "533ff13c0e0a262b920012c2", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "An interesting story in a well driven story and high quality cut.\r\n\r\nHowever, it tries to be much more epic than what it actually is.", "created_at": "2014-04-05T12:04:12.807Z"}, {"movie_id": 84334, "review_id": "5d500986079a970b9eae3d36", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "An unlikely and interesting story that is part historical, part investigation and ultimately satisfying.
