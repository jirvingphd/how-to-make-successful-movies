This was slightly different than the usual films. Only on the characters, but the story was pretty much the same like about jealousness. The story of a middle aged woman and to begin the life again. Alice a daughter of a famous filmmaker, is not all happy in her life after the marriage is at in the risk of collapse. Then suddenly all changes when three youngsters she meets at the club. What follows after is to enlighten her life, but not everything's going to be fine. It could be more trouble than the solution she's hoping for, especially for a long term in mind. So what are those issues and how it resolved were told in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nFrom a new director. She wrote it as well. I've seen many women director's films in this year than any other. They are making revolution here. This is actually a decent film, but surely not a bad one as you have heard. Reese Witherspoon was awesome. She always good at such roles. So basically this film is for her to watch. But the three young actors too was not bad. The story was better, especially how it all ended. This is for the gown ups, above 25-30 years old people. Because of how everything revolved, only they can understand it better. And also for the open minded people, because it's about the modern moral thing like traditional sentiments in a relationship were removed to narrate this tale. So definitely a decent film to watch once in my opinion!\r\n\r\n_7/10_", "created_at": "2018-02-04T14:41:24.865Z"}]
