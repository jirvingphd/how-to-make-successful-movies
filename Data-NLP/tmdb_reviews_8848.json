Compared to other Statham flicks, The Bank Job was slow-paced and more dramatic than action-focused. Some of the pacing results from the story being based on an actual bank robbery in 1971. As intriguing as that is, it also made the story drag on. The heist takes place halfway through the film, with a full hour of runtime before the end. The robbery's aftermath is filled with political maneuvering and negotiation between several dangerous groups interested in the contents of the safe.
