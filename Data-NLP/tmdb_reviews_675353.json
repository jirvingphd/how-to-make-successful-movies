This one I also watched with the kids and I have to say it was some fun two hours.\r\n\r\nThese movies are pure comedies with an aspect of adventure. Make no mistake about, they are silly movies. Then, with Jim Carrey in one of the lead roles that is what anyone that has not lived under a rock in Coyote land would expect.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey more often than not grates on me with his overacting and ridiculous behavior but in this movie he is the perfect fit.\r\n\r\nThe movie sets the tone right away when it starts at the mushroom planet, or as Jim Carrey (Dr Robotnik) calls it, the piece of shitake planet, with Dr Robotnik\u2019s coffee making machinery.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is one long ride of, mostly, slapstick jokes but still following the red thread of the story. A story which is not really bad and which adds a nice adventure aspect to the movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie even adds some realism, although they probably did not realize that during production, in that the federal agents are just as big a\u2013holes as they have proven themselves to be in real life lately.\r\n\r\nThe grand finale with Dr Robotnik\u2019s huge robot was quite hilarious. I really do not want to spoil things but watch out for that moustache. I\u2019m happy that they refrained from following up that snot laser with a fart laser though.\r\n\r\nBottom line, a really fun family adventure movie.", "created_at": "2022-08-14T13:42:32.367Z"}, {"movie_id": 675353, "review_id": "631fa311392712008065f1a4", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "Lol, I can't believe these movies are being made. If you're adapting the Sonic canon into a modern family-action-comedy film, this is kind of the best-case scenario.\r\n\r\nMuch more bonkers than I anticipated, but not always in a good way.

This time the movie swaps Sonic's human sidekicks for animated characters from the games, with Idris Elba's Knuckles being surprisingly funny (I didn't expect that from the trailers). Just like the first movie, Carrey makes this movie so entertaining. His outrageous performance perfectly fits the role of a kids' video game villain, and his snappy dialogue and quipped one-liners made me laugh at almost every scene he graced. Sonic 2 is not a typical movie I would choose for myself, but I'm not upset when my little daughter chooses to watch it over many other kids' movie options.", "created_at": "2023-01-02T02:29:03.549Z"}]
