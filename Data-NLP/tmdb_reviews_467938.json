Instead of pouring gunpowder into her open wound and then lighting it, she decides to go the 'heated beer can route.' Not just any beer can, MEXICAN BEER - with a nifty eagle logo.\r\nAfter branding herself with the hot metal beer can it magically seals up her back wound also. Ah, the wonders of modern medical care.\r\nAs an extra to her life saving self-surgery, she picked up a new eagle tattoo imprinted from beer can. There appears to be some witchcraft at work also, because instead of leaving a negative print (a reverse image) the eagle's logo along with its text are transferred the correct way around. You can't help but laugh out loud. This is one of many plot holes throughout the movie that are so gaping (like the one that should still be visible in Jen's back) you cannot help be drawn to them.\r\nMirror images seem to be a theme as you'll notice later in the movie. \r\n\r\nAt this time, Jen has taken on a kind of Mary Sue meets Rambo persona. She doesn't need blood, food or water to survive; or internal organs for that matter, and she has an essence of indestructibility. The film has entered a kind of dark comedy territory.\r\nWe proceed in the story when she hunts down her transgressors and it turns out Jen's not the only one who can withstand near fatal damage. The Friday the 13th franchise passes more for realism at this stage in comparison and the movie more resembles an outrageous music video.\r\n\r\nIn summary: Revenge is mildly entertaining if you can get past its absurdity and idiotic plot holes. Unfortunately, that's where it has to lose so many marks for me. The filmmakers treat their audience as morons and you cannot ignore so many obvious errors. That ruined the experience for me.\r\n**Verdict: 2/10**", "created_at": "2020-06-13T02:57:59.459Z"}]
