This film also takes you into some very realistic topics, too, like grieving for a loved one, being bullied by classmates and accepting who you are.\r\n\r\nRyan Reynolds is in front of us with the same character he has been playing for the last 15 years.\r\nWhat really surprises me is the harmony of someone like Reynolds, who was in front of the camera with the world's greatest actors and actresses, with Walker Scobell, who had his first acting experience at the age of 12.  They made a great duo team.\r\n\r\nThe overall storyline of the movie is creative, but it does not really have any unique plot twists nor is it fully developed. And as a result, this film comes off a little bland and seems to be missing something.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't promise much as it is what we've always been seeing but it's pretty good at delivering what it promises. \r\nLong story short, 'The Adam Project' is a movie made to entertain the audience and it succeeds.\r\n\u2022\r\n\u2022\r\nEnjoyment Rating: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f/5\r\n\u2022\r\nOverall Score: 8.0/10", "created_at": "2022-03-22T07:25:56.945Z"}, {"movie_id": 696806, "review_id": "6241e4973e09f30087c16c14", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "**Full Analysis at Spotamovie.com** - **Intro** - Released in March 2022, The Adam Project is a movie for those who love Sci-Fi, actions, CGI, and those who wish to change their past to let any regrets disappear. The Adam Project delivers a combination of funny entertainment and some meaningful messages. Ryan Reynolds and the director, Shawn Levy, are back together after the incredible success of Free Guy. - **The Story** - Adam Reed is a young boy grieving his father\u2019s death and suffering the pains of bullying. Then, one night he found a wounded pilot in his dad\u2019s garage. The intruder needs Adam\u2019s help because he risked everything for a secret mission to be back in time. But, the operation can\u2019t fail because the world is in grave danger. The real challenge for the task is that both of them don\u2019t like each other. So, some questions are mandatory: Who is the pilot? Why is this mission so dangerous for the world? And what is the reason that moves the pilot to this desperate operation? But also, what are we going to learn from this story? - **We will explain all of this in our review and analysis available at https://www.spotamovie.com/the-adam-project-review-and-explanation-critic-post-movie-netflix-movie-2022/**", "created_at": "2022-03-28T16:38:47.465Z"}, {"movie_id": 696806, "review_id": "626265476eecee30f0d060f9", "author_rating": 10.0, "review_text": "**\" BACK -{ FROM }- THE FUTURE \ud83c\udf20 \"**\r\n\r\nA Netflix **-{ MINI }-** Review...

You'd think I'd be better at it by now!!!\"\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nIf you're someone who's presently in the mood to take a -Welcome- Break from all the doom and gloom on the news right now and watch a movie that comes **\"FULL-CIRCLE\"** in the most Enthralling, Engaging, and indeed -{ Heartwarming }- of ways . . . then I wish to -Wholeheartedly- recommend \"The Adam Project\", **( TAP for short ),** to you. The only -Other- cinematic experience I've had where a film came Full-Circle in -Such- beautiful fashion, in -Recent- memory at least, would be the simply Fabulous \"SpiderMan: No Way Home\" **( \"SM-NWH\" ).** It is a picture that literally ( And -Very- Cleverly ) ties up loose ends within the -{ Entire }- Spiderman CANON of films, from as far back as 2002. It also just happens to be the -Last- Massive Blockbuster that I reviewed ; before going on an -Entirely- unplanned, ( but -Incredibly- refreshing ) 'Extended 101-day hiatus from reviewing'.\r\n\r\nOk, so if you thought that the 13 yr. old \"Newcomer\" of said film, pint-sized thespian  Walker Scobell was a tremendous -Dramatic- actor, well, then you'd only be -Half- right. The fact of the mater is... he's also a terrific **-COMEDIC-** talent, with seriously \"Impeccable\" timing, especially given that this is, get this ...his -{ First Ever }- movie or TV ( 'Feature' ) appearance. Factor Walker's \"Super-Fun\" performance in alongside a 'full spectrum' of absolute **-{ \"POWERHOUSE!\" }-** deliveries from the film's unequivocal ensemble principal cast of Protagonists ( Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner,  ) . . . then add in some absolutely -Fantastic- ( & truly state of the art ) CGI, a genuinely -Mindblowing- grand finale set piece ...and the kind of fight choreography that you really have to -See- ...to believe . . . & you have a seriously, seriously exciting picture, indeed.\r\n\r\nNot to mention **FUNNY AS HELL!!!** I really hadn't laughed so hard in a long time ; -since- ( about the 3rd time ) I watched SM-NWH, to be precise. On the downside, though . . . & if I'm to be 'painfully' honest . . . -Both- the Villain ( ...don't get me wrong, the person who plays the main 'baddie' is a Veteran performer ; I just felt like the Writing there could have been just that \"Little Bit Stronger\"... ) -And- her 'ever loyal' henchman are a 'tad weak', as is the very title of the film, itself. Even something as ( relatively ) simple as **\"FLASH-BACK-FORWARD\",** would have been -{ Far }- catchier than its existing name, ( although I do think I sorta understand -Why- they called it what they did, for what it's worth ). It's for these two reasons -Alone- that I -Didn't- give it my trademark \"25/10\" ; reserved especially for movies That Move Me **-{ VERY }-** Deeply, as TAP ( ...quite obviously... ) -Did-.\r\n\r\nSummary: This is a picture that, ( among -several- other things ), pointedly asks the question: If you could -{ Somehow }- go back in time, & talk to your Younger-Self... **\"WHAT'D YOU SAY?\"** ...& in the most -Intriguing- of ways, at that. Furthermore, having lost my Dearly Beloved Father when I was -Just- 13, in a horrible, brutal car crash, TAP resonated with me **PROFOUNDLY.** It is has some Genuinely **\"TENDER\"** Moments, &  does a **-Phenomenal-** job of addressing the issue of 'Estranged Father-Son Relationships' the world over, but most especially in the USA ; ( where the film is also -Set- ) ; and where the issue is quite possibly now almost at epidemic levels, what with the country's sky-high divorce rate, separation rate, & just plain old 'Absentee Father-ism', in general. All said & done, the  **\"EVER-DYNAMIC!** Duo\" of Actor Ryan Reynolds & Director Shawn Levy have well & truly \"Done it Again\". Although this **-ISN'T-** a Marvel movie, It -does- star a **\"Handful Of Marvel's Best & Brightest\"** and -is- ultimately, \" A ( not so ) little cinematic streaming **MARVEL** \ud83c\udf20 \", in its 'Very Own Right'.

The movie starts incredibly strong, introducing the viewer to the main characters. The chemistry between the two actors is fantastic and feels really genuine, creating an instant connection between the two and the audience. Walker Scobell does an excellent job doing his best Ryan Reynolds impersonation, making me really buy into the fact that they are the same character. This pace carries on up until the second act when characters and lore are being thrown at the viewer left and right. This section feels incredibly rushed resulting in the viewer having very little emotional connection with the ideas introduced. Zoe Saldana and Mark Ruffalo do a fantastic job with the limited screen time that they have, it was great seeing them outside of their standard CGI suits (looking at you Marvel). The antagonist wore her welcome towards the end of the film as her antics seemed a little forced. The comedy in this movie was done fairly well. I enjoyed the fast sarcastic nature of the boy and his back and forth with Reynolds, but some jokes did fall flat. But that is par for the course in any comedy. Overall, this film was enjoyable and even though it had its faults I appreciated the concepts it delivered.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_", "created_at": "2022-07-07T23:54:34.371Z"}, {"movie_id": 696806, "review_id": "630016e8532acb00844c934c", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "**Overall : Its sincere story results in one of Netflix's better original movies.**\r\n\r\nA surprisingly heartfelt film that shocked me with how well it made me care for each of its characters. I watched this movie with low expectations due to Netflix's disappointing track record of mediocre original movies. Each actor felt typecast into roles they had played before but still delivered meaningful performances. The effects and production were fairly typical of a Netflix project.
