Samuel Jackson was the perfect choice to play no-nonsense but compassionate Coach Ken Carter that believed in his players while holding them to standards that changed their lives. While the movie is about basketball, the focus is much more on the relationships and development of its characters. The actual basketball scenes of the movie are decent but less compelling than the rest of the story. Coach Carter is an excellent film for those that want to see how their choices and willingness to fight compromise can change the lives of others.", "created_at": "2022-11-26T00:18:45.150Z"}]
