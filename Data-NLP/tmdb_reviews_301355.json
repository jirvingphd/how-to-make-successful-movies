It doesn't do anything revolutionary or anything, yet still managed to keep me watching with interest for practically all of the 102 minute run time. I like how it starts most, with the connections feeling believable. It loses some of that as it goes on, though it didn't affect my enjoyment all that much.\r\n\r\nBoseman really is the only true star of this though, as he gives a very good performance in the lead role as Jacob. Luke Evans (Paul) is pleasant too, while Teresa Palmer (Kelly) has a few moments. Alfred Molina (Mike) also appears, as do Messrs Draco Malfoy and Brad Bellick...\r\n\r\nThe ending isn't the greatest, though it is still serviceable. That coupled with the nice look of the film and a certain Mr. Boseman mean I'll remember this in a positive manner.", "created_at": "2021-03-16T05:04:17.786Z"}]
