Watching that edit made me think it would be a psycho-type of movie. However, after watching it now, I have to say it went over my head. I'm not saying it's bad; I had high expectations for it, but it couldn't deliver as much as I hoped. Nonetheless, the amount it did deliver was nice. What I liked the most about this movie is its cinematography, especially the zoom-in shots. Overall, for me, it falls into the 'good' tier.
