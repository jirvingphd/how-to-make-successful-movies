I am not going to pretend it is in any way groundbreaking; indeed in many ways it reinforces some pretty infantile stereotypes. A world class straight swimmer (Nicolas Gob) makes derogatory remarks about a gay reporter and is \"sentenced\" to look after the French gay water polo team by way of punishment. They turn out to be the worst kind of sporting team imaginable - but add swimming trunks (sometimes!) and the film tells the story of how he manages to get them to the Gay Games in Croatia. It is a predictable but fun romp, nonetheless. In a genre frequently super-charged with political correctness and sex; this is just a bit of fun. Give it a go - it will make you smile.", "created_at": "2022-03-28T10:48:10.608Z"}]
