[{"movie_id": 351037, "review_id": "570fb8629251416d9500046a", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "> The brotherhood is tested for a woman they're onto.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch crime-drama about two brothers, especially the plot revolves as a love triangle, but it is not a romance movie. The movie opened in the middle of some crime scene which is never going to be revealed what actually happened, because it wasn't important as the film's narration is something else. What comes later is the twist in the character's relationship with each other, especially between two brothers and a woman they're in love.\r\n\r\nThe actual story begins a few years later to that opening incident. Looks everything has changed at that point, except one of the brother who just stepped outside the prison. The remaining is all about the condition of the family and the romance relationship that appears to be complicated to explain to one another. When it begins to unfold, the final twist strikes which bring further complexity to the conclusion section.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I did not like the first two acts. Actually, I expected it to be a crime story. With two tough characters the scenes did not create enough curiosity or the thrilling moments. But the third act is where the movie changed its pace as well as genre to what I was eagerly waiting for. Because of the decent developments in the earlier, this ending was so exciting. But overall product is just above average. That means it is not a bad flick, yet everyone's not going to like it.\r\n\r\n6/10", "created_at": "2016-04-14T15:33:54.324Z"}, {"movie_id": 351037, "review_id": "570fb8629251416d9500046a", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "> The brotherhood is tested for a woman they're onto.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch crime-drama about two brothers, especially the plot revolves as a love triangle, but it is not a romance movie.
