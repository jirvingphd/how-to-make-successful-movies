Most other reviewers clearly didn't and I respect that, but I genuinely found it alright. It's definitely the weakest entry of the series, yet I still found it entertaining enough.\r\n\r\nMartin Short (Jack Frost) is the star of this second sequel to 1994's <em>'The Santa Clause'</em>, outshining lead Tim Allen; who is still decent, by the way. I love Short's character design, he looks ridiculous in the nicest possible way and Frost (why him, I'm not sure I admit) makes for a relatively good villain. All the other cast members take a backseat, while the storyline of Alan Arkin's Bud is very forgettable and arguably needless.\r\n\r\nI was expecting to dislike this and the preceding follow-up, but to my surprise they are actually - at least to me - harmlessly fun festive films.", "created_at": "2020-10-02T00:32:30.888Z"}]
