Some stunt work was alright but nothing that really stands out and none of the cast really were all that memorable. Did appreciate some of the nods to the cartoons but otherwise just very forgettable. **2.75/5**", "created_at": "2021-07-23T05:51:31.222Z"}, {"movie_id": 14869, "review_id": "63bf7769df857c007cbd8cba", "author_rating": 1.0, "review_text": "People like me were waiting for a GI Joe movie for decades. It was instead kind of a hack that could have been any other movie.\r\n\r\nI don't think that the distaste came from the fact that the movie could never live up to memories of childhood play. I think that the distaste came from the knoweldge that Larry Hama had decades of fun and wonderful stories to tell, he had written an entire little universe... and the movie was nothing like it.\r\n\r\nIt hardly even resembled the cartoon.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T02:58:49.212Z"}]
