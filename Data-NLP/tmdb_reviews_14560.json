When the mall is taken over by a gang of organized thugs, can Paul Blart rise to the challenge?\r\n\r\nWhether or not you\u2019ll like \u201cPaul Blart: Mall Cop\u201d (2009) will depend on if you appreciate Kevin James and his goofy, unprofane brand of humor, as depicted in The King of Queens, \u201cZookeeper\u201d (2011) and \u201cTrue Memoirs of an International Assassin\u201d (2016). While it\u2019s not as good as \u201cZookeeper,\u201d it\u2019s not far off. After the first 25 minutes or so you\u2019ll find yourself engrossed in Paul\u2019s life; you understand him and like him. You feel for the man as he gazes longingly at a receipt with the handwritten name of his romantic interest. And you\u2019ll root for him and laugh when a serious threat engulfs the mall.\r\n\r\nKeir O'Donnell plays Paul\u2019s greenhorn partner, Veck. He\u2019s reminiscent of a young Tim Roth. In other news, Mays has the cutest wide-eyed face.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes and was shot entirely in Massachusetts (Burlington, Braintree, Peabody, West Roxbury and Bedford).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "created_at": "2018-08-22T20:41:31.955Z"}]
