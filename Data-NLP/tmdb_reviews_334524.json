It's both a treasure hunt film, and a wall street tale. The great mix of two made it a fine film. Wall street based films always fascinates the grown-ups. So do this film. Matthew McConaughey playing in one of two main role, I thought it should have been called 'Fool's Gold 2'. You will know why I said that once you watch it, or maybe you know it already. But the end twist was something different, changed everything.\r\n\r\nThe man who inherited the family business of mining, is now in the crisis of losing everything. His final move is to join the hand with another man struggling as same as he is. They both pull off successfully the initial hiccup. And after a long struggle, seems they had hit a bullseye. The lives have changed forever or is it! Another trouble follows them, following, the story reaches the end with a twist.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought it was like in the line of 'There Will Be Blood'. As the narration progresses, the gear changed between the two worlds. One being in the US and then in Indonesian Jungle. I thought the end should have been little more detail, but it still worked fine.An underrated film for sure. If it was a DiCaprio film, it would have been highly praised.\r\n\r\nActually, I liked it. Well written screenplay and performances. Matthew McConaughey was awesome. We talk about actor like Johnny Depp for playing roles in awesome costumes, but this guy turned the roles to reality. It's either 'Dallas Buyer's Club' or this or any others. He deserves well respect more the big names right now. Thousand times better than accidental actor, DiCaprio.\r\n\r\nEdgar Ramirez was also good. Bryce Dallas Howard had an important role as well. Overall, This is one of the films not to miss from the 2016 calender. It could have been a box office bomb, but definitely will be recognised as the time pass by. I would surely suggest it to anybody.\r\n\r\n_8/10_", "created_at": "2017-11-04T20:31:17.276Z"}, {"movie_id": 334524, "review_id": "59fe2395c3a36868930267a2", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "**Treasure hunt meets the wall street!**\r\n\r\nLoosely based on the real.
