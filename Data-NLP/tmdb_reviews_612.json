The movie was tense and entertaining, with an ensemble cast you have to appreciate.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to delve into the politics behind the movie or its accuracy. I am looking only at it for its entertainment value. There were a few things I really liked about it. The chemistry among the mission team, once it developed, was impressive. They are not bosom buddies at all, but they grew to appreciate what each other brought to the team. Although there is plenty of tension here, I also appreciated the angle of these men beginning to question the ethics of what they were doing. That sets this script aside from most other thrillers. And I really like Ciara Hinds. He brings a calmness to the role, a calm backed by strength. I have liked in other roles, so it is no more than I expect.\r\n\r\nI am not a fan of thrillers, but if there were more like this one, who knows?", "created_at": "2021-05-09T22:45:19.269Z"}]
