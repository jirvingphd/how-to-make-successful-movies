After this watch, I'm thinking this is from where \"Benchwarmers\" might have been inspired.\r\n\r\nI think it's more of the \"misfits working together\" trope that gets me, and you see it in lots of kids sports movies: \"Kicking & Screaming\", \"The Sandlot\", \"Little Giants\", \"Mighty Ducks\".\r\n\r\nThis rolls in a lot of adult humor as well, so while you might have to have a few talks with your kids (which you should have had before watching a movie that would unexpectedly prompt them), but I think it's a movie that the whole family could actually watch.\r\n\r\nIt's not great, but it was fun.", "created_at": "2020-09-22T23:53:24.929Z"}, {"movie_id": 13341, "review_id": "644728aa21118f04e3f2ff73", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Good movie.
