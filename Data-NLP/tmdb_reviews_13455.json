The super powers include pushers, who can push thoughts into other\u2019s minds; movers, who have the power of telekinesis; watchers, who are seers; sniffers, who can find others; shadowers, who can block watchers and sniffers; screamers, who can attack through shrieks; and more. Djimon Hounsou plays the head agent of the Division. \r\n\r\n\u201cPush\u201d (2009) is a thriller that combines the style and themes of \u201cLucy\u201d (2014) with the surreal take on a major Asian city of \u201cLost in Translation\u201d (2003). Imagine the abilities of Professor X, Jean Grey and Magneto of the \u201cX-Men\u201d flicks, but without the costumes and superhero trappings, and you\u2019d have a good idea of \u201cPush.\u201d The setting of Hong Kong is a highlight, but it focuses mostly on the working class underbelly rather than the posh areas of Tokyo seen in \u201cLost in Translation.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe style is hip and kinetic, like \u201cLucy\u201d and \u201cEye of the Beholder\u201d (1998), and the film does a good job of keeping the complicated elements understandable to the viewer. There\u2019s also a quality score/soundtrack. Yet it\u2019s the least of all these pics mentioned. The story\u2019s just not as engrossing, but it\u2019s not too far off either. The Division is suggestive of MK Ultra on steroids.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes and was shot in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "created_at": "2019-04-29T04:59:01.389Z"}]
