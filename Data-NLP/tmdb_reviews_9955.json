Not to mention its routed slightly in homophobia which seems like they're doubling down on a problem that men's figure skating is already dealing with.\r\n\r\nI'm not into skating, but I can't imagine anyone who is into skating is going to be excited or enjoy the jokes at their expense, so I'm a little lost at who the audience is for this unless it's \"people that hate figure skating\" and I don't see them watching a figure skating movie.\r\n\r\nA lot of the jokes just fall flat, and it's not like they don't know who to structure jokes throughout the story: the villains actually have a well constructed arc, just not a great quality to it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are mostly unlikable and chaotic, the movie is literally telling them to stop it for half the movie, and by the time it stops I don't care what the characters do until the end.\r\n\r\nThe best bit was the romantic story arc which was heavily polluted by the rest of the story.", "created_at": "2021-07-10T19:17:02.136Z"}, {"movie_id": 9955, "review_id": "644f469e35039802ddd4debf", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "I really thought this movie would be horrible.
