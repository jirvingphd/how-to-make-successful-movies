His plan to build a 300m tower wins - it beat the M\u00e8tro - but pretty quickly he faces industrial issues, strikes, banking confidence colly-wobbles and to add to his complications, he re-alights on \"Adrienne\", by now married to the influential \"Antoine\" (Pierre Deladonchamps). There are a few scenes - especially when they are laying the foundations to the tower and when aligning the metal works, when the engineering elements impress and we get some clue as to his genius. The use of sand, water and sheer brute force to ensure millimetre accuracy is sometimes quite tensely portrayed here. Unfortunately, though, for the most part it's a rather uninspiring melodrama about his turbulent relationship and though it does offer an interesting explanation as to why the tower might look like the letter \"A\", it all just sinks into a rather mediocre sediment of mush.
