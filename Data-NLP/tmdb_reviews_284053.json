Cate Blanchett as the villainess Hela, the Goddess of Death, is a far better villain that TDW's lame Malekith. Kat Dennings' annoying Darcy and Natalie Portman's bland Jane are not missed at all. Instead, we get Tessa Thompson's badass Valkyrie, who can hold her own in a fight and isn't just there just as a love interest for Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Jeff Goldblum is hilarious as Grandmaster, who runs the gladiator fights on the planet Sakaar. But the real pleasure of the movie is watching the love-hate brother relationship between Thor and his adoptive brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The relationship between the two men was the only redeeming feature of TDW, and it's great to see it expanded in this movie. Also great is seeing Thor buddy up with Bruce Banner/ Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the fate of The Warriors Three. They deserved better than that. But otherwise, it's a great comic book movie.", "created_at": "2017-11-12T21:31:56.063Z"}, {"movie_id": 284053, "review_id": "5c842588c3a3684e9ddb0434", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "From minute one, Thor Ragnarok bursts onto the screen with a new found energy, style, Jeff Goldblum, beautiful use of colours and shot compositions, an amazing 80s inspired music score, and comedy that's actually funny.

I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the story unfold, the score is terrific, the new and old cast members are great and there's a lot of amusement in there too. It's superb, it's my third favourite MCU film at this stage.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I like the 2011 original but that's turned out to be the weakest of the three. I found <em>'Thor: The Dark World'</em> to be a fairly major improvement on that, this 2017 is narrowly better than that aforementioned 2013 release. Bring on <em>'Thor: Love and Thunder'</em>!\r\n\r\nChris Hemsworth is quality in the lead role, I found him super enjoyable in this second sequel. Big fan of his new hairstyle, by the way. This is also the most I liked Tom Hiddleston in an MCU film. Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett and, particularly, Tessa Thompson are fab additions. Shoutout to (director, as well!) Taika Waititi also, he made me laugh a fair few times as Korg.\r\n\r\nGreat film, oh and I love the nod to a certain 1971 Quaker Oats Company-induced film... nicely done.", "created_at": "2021-01-22T03:03:45.830Z"}, {"movie_id": 284053, "review_id": "63c216bba5743d00b0bfab77", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "OK, this isn't what the advertisements say, at least its not the best Marvel movie (I think that title stills goes to Winter Soldier).

And, well, the best parts of the first Thor were the parts when he was on Earth.\r\n\r\nHere we have more humor in the film, which isn't unique for Thor, but this one has more of an Antman feel, or at least it has the humor we saw in the Thor Spots around Civil War.\r\n\r\nIt works, the humor plays very well and it's done, well, perfectly. Thor's humor is almost in the vein of a jovial meathead and a very likable one. Plus, Chris Hemsworth has great comedic timing and sensibilities. He knows how to deliver a joke in a believable way without going over-the-top.\r\n\r\nIt works.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, Tom Hiddleston works exceptionally well with the lead.\r\n\r\nMark Ruffalo has returned and he has been gone far too long. Far too long. And, really, Hulk is the best character to pit with Thor, both in his green form and as Banner.\r\n\r\nI'd go further, but that would lead into spoilers, but it was nice to see a spin on World War Hulk, and it did leave the door wide open for another Thor story...\r\n\r\nAnd if they do continue this saga, it would be wonderful to see it done in the same way.\r\n\r\nThis was a great break from the previous Thor films, which, especially with Dark World, felt kind of like a chore.", "created_at": "2023-01-14T02:43:07.206Z"}]
