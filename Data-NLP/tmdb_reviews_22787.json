It wasn't until Netflix recommended it for me and I read the description, that I thought there might be something there. While the previews made it look like some arctic nightmare, the truth is that it was a pretty great film. The story is centered around a U.S. Marshall, stationed at the base in Antarctica. For more than 3 years, she didn't really have much to do, but that all changed when two base members are found murdered. It then becomes Carrie Stetko's job to solve the first murders in the continents history. Despite a lack of other people and places to go, the writers of this film did an excellent job at keeping this movie intriguing. I didn't think in a million years that a film like this would work, but actually it works out really well, and unlike a similar story, Fargo, the producers of Whiteout hold nothing back. Kate Beckinsale stars and really does a fantastic job. I've always like her abilities, not to mention the way she looks, but this film is the first time her performance really stood out to me as something special, maybe she should consider playing a cop more often. As someone who's seen thousands of films, it always amazes me how the films I expect the least from, always deliver the biggest surprises. Whiteout is pure intensity, not to mention, a great mystery, that is absolutely worth seeing.", "created_at": "2013-11-27T05:46:13.980Z"}, {"movie_id": 22787, "review_id": "52958725760ee34ab90a6def", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078 - When I first saw the previews for Whiteout, I didn't think it would be anything special.
