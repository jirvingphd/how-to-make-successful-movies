The recording and shaky camera won't be there for the largest part, it's full of stupid/nonsense moments and the story isn't that engaging. They also added \"funny\" scenes for some reasons, totally breaking the suspense, therefore it won't even feel realistic at all. Too much splatter for my taste too.\r\n\r\nThere are three positive things about REC3 though: it features great looking zombies, sounds are excellent, and fortunately it's short (only 80 minutes).\r\n\r\n_(3 stars out of 10)_", "created_at": "2017-10-26T19:53:03.479Z"}]
