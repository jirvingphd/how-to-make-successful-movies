It's nothing deep or massively meaningful, but it's good family fun that the younger audiences will probably largely like. It doesn't feel Disney-esque, I will say that.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of instantly noticeable voices in the cast. Steve Buscemi, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jennifer Tilly and Judi Dench all appear as Wesley, Buck, Grace and Mrs. Caloway respectively. Away from them, Randy Quaid does well as Alameda Slim, while Sam Levine is mildly amusing as the Willie Brothers.\r\n\r\nPremise-wise it's nothing standout or entirely memorable, but I had a nice enough time watching it unfold and that's all you really ask for. Solid film.", "created_at": "2020-08-01T13:53:51.071Z"}]
