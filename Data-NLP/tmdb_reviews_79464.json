We decided to give it a bit longer because it had nearly eighty wins and nominations. I began to realize that some of this was meant to be humorous, and relaxed into the ridiculousness of the opening premise.\r\n\r\nTurns out this is one hell of a romantic film. The songs (and of course the dancing) are absolutely phenomenal. Ranbir Kapoor's character demonstrates great development over the long time period of the film. And Nargis Fakhri is both beautiful and awesome in her role.\r\n\r\nSo worth the 159 minutes!", "created_at": "2023-05-20T23:37:34.517Z"}]
