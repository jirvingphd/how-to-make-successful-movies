There is plenty of sly adult humour that isn't dodgy, and enough slapstick so the kids will laugh at the silly bear's antics.\r\n\r\nOn top of that it is well animated, and full of heart.\r\n\r\n8/10", "created_at": "2018-05-26T11:12:25.212Z"}, {"movie_id": 116149, "review_id": "5e0c448efd4f8000155b164f", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "So fuckin' cute.
