Bearing in mind the directorial debuts of Channing Tatum and Reid Carolin, it's worth highlighting the lack of extreme dramatizations or overly sophisticated shots, which helped keep the narrative quite natural.\r\n\r\nDespite an odd plot point or two, Briggs and Lulu share emotionally impactful interactions that will generate a lot of smiles, a few laughs, and, who knows, a tear or two - Thomas Newman's fantastic score will surely cause that.\r\n\r\nI couldn't recommend this film more for anyone who considers their pet as their best friend.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-", "created_at": "2022-02-17T23:15:55.449Z"}, {"movie_id": 626735, "review_id": "63f43f3f4a4bfc0079c66fe1", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "<em>'Dog'</em> won me over by its end.\r\n\r\nAcross the first half of this film, I wasn't feeling it at all - the whole vibe of the film just felt off, with lead Channing Tatum not really doing anything for me. However, the second half does, in fairness, save it. By the conclusion, I actually felt invested in both characters - quite the turnaround!", "created_at": "2023-02-21T03:49:19.300Z"}]
