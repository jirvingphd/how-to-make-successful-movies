They decide on a Greek island resort known for its wild nightlife, clubs, drink, sea, sand and of course lots of young women \"who are gagging for it!\" according to Jay - one of the four, who quite often tells lots of white lies regarding his sexual prowess with women!\r\n\r\nThere is not much of a story to be honest, although Simon still yearns over his on/off girlfriend Carli, who by coincidence is also holidaying at the same resort. And Will is still trying to lose his virginity while still coming across as a cynical public schoolboy with morals.\r\n\r\nAnd that's essentially it. There's plenty of jokes and pratfalls to be had, as you might expect with 4 lads getting drunk in a Greek resort; but I didn't find it as funny or the writing as good as the TV series. For one thing their respective parents only had a couple of minutes screen-time here, and I think without them as an extra foil to the angst-ridden teenagers the film just didn't quite work, and felt rather stretched and repetitive as it just focuses on the four and how they interact with the locals and other holidaymakers.\r\n\r\nWorth a watch if you're a fan.", "created_at": "2019-12-04T08:00:53.894Z"}]
