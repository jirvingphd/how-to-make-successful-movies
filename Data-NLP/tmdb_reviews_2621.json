Like many movies, the plot relies on a huge coincidence or three. The story gets sappy and sentimental in places, is rather predictable and has too much religion to suit me, but that last thing may suit you just fine, praise be. It was co-written and directed by the actress Bonnie Hunt, who is a supporting character in the film.\r\n\r\nBut there is a spark of chemistry between the two lead characters, the dialogue is smart and sharp, and the movie is rich with its supporting cast, such as Jim Belushi, Robert Loggia and Archie Bunker - I mean Carroll O\u2019Connor. Plus I have liked Minnie Driver since Circle of Friends. \r\n\r\nJust keep in mind this isn\u2019t Hitchcock or Frank Capra stuff and doesn\u2019t try to be. Just let it flow over you", "created_at": "2021-05-02T04:15:00.401Z"}]
