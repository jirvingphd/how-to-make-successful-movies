Also not sure if there was meant to be one with the news team, and Sigourney Weaver's talent was utterly wasted.\r\n\r\nAll that said, the stunt and car chase sequences in the final act was great and a good choice more or less having Dennis Quaid being the lead of the ensemble. This probably makes for a fine weekend viewing even if the pacing, that is the jumping from one POV to the other, never quite worked but still found it entertaining. **3.5/5**", "created_at": "2020-05-03T20:48:16.864Z"}]
