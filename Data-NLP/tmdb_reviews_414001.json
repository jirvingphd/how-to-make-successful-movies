I thought the movie was entertaining overall, and well acted. At the same time I had a couple of problems with it. One was that I found the family flashbacks while he was at sea to be distracting. It wasn\u2019t a big thing, but they didn\u2019t seem meaningful or well placed as far as furthering the plot or his character.\r\n\r\nThe other issue was perhaps because I wasn\u2019t paying close enough attention, but a few gaps emerged for me as far as knowing what he was doing during the voyage. It made sense to me when I researched his story a bit, but until then there as some confusion for me.  But I wouldn\u2019t discourage anyone for watching it for that or any other reason.", "created_at": "2021-01-26T04:02:45.185Z"}]
