The acting is ok, by and large, but a few \"guest appearances\" from Kiefer Sutherland, Gena Rowlands and probably the briefest of roles in his career for Justin Chatwin, can't really develop the rather dreary writing nor give it much sparkle as we lumber towards an ending that is just plain daft. In theory, the story is complex and has enough about it to keep us guessing, but the overall execution is flat and proves pretty uninteresting after about ten minutes.
