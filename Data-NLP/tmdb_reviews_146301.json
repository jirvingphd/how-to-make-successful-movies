The one saving grace, thank goodness, is John Rutland's delicious cinematography that is vividly shot with imaginative urgency. As for the 3-D special effects that are scattered throughout The Ghost Dimension, they somewhat resonate but it is nothing that one would label compellingly expressive from a visual standpoint.   \r\n\r\nIf the Paranormal Activity legacy has a Ghost of a chance to preserve its movie-making memories, it should take its final curtain call with Dimension and allow any found footage of these churned out sequels to speak for itself in the haunted house genre it contributed to so convincingly in its heralded heyday.\r\n\r\nParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension (2015)\r\n\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n\r\n1 hr. 28 mins.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarring: Chris J.

The concept of \u201ca special camera that can see spirits\u201d may have seemed intriguing at first, but in practice, it runs counter to the entire premise of the \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d franchise . After all, it\u2019s far more unsettling to speculate about what a demon may look like than actually seeing one. Moreover, the horror element is diminished if the audience knows the demons\u2019 next move; the film becomes little more than a collection of cheap scares tossed in for effect. The story is poorly written; the characters are among the franchise\u2019s most inept yet, and they\u2019ll make you scratch your head despite the performers\u2019 best efforts. \u201cThe Ghost Dimension\u201d presented some new lore, but ultimately failed to achieve anything substantial. In any case, as it is, it\u2019s a disappointing sixth entry in a franchise that has been pushed through the Hollywood meat grinder to cash in on the first film\u2019s success.\r\n___\r\nRating: **5/10** *(Meh, Nothing Remarkable)*", "created_at": "2022-11-02T11:17:42.336Z"}, {"movie_id": 146301, "review_id": "64bfbf096ee3d700ac43299c", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "They at least made this movie to connect with the previous ones.
