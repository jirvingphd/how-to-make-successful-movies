[{"movie_id": 284276, "review_id": "55d381edc3a3683b83000414", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "> Aniston at best!\r\n\r\nMight be this is what I was expecting from Aniston from a long ago. Since break-up with Brad Pitt, probably after 'Marley & Me', she has not given any best performance. This is her best shot to till date, maybe in her whole career. She would have not won, but her snub from the Oscar nominee was not justified. Unlike men, who gets better by aging, women are the opposite. In the old days I used to like Aniston, but nowadays, I don't know. In this film she has done without makeup, well, that's an honest attempt.\r\n\r\nNot a spellbinding narration, but it was all about Aniston's performance. There are a couple of cameo appearances, well, all the other character in the movie is like a cameo, including Sam Worthington's, but excluding our heroine. Worth watching this only for her performance, not for the story.\r\n\r\nThe past events should have been explained to let us know the truth along with the portrayal of the present. But it was kind of realism, I won't doubt about that, but sometime cinematic needs a proper detail rather than straightforward. Really a good movie, simultaneously not great as to praise the direction or the presentation that slightly missed the opportunity to be an awesome flick.\r\n\r\n7/10", "created_at": "2015-08-18T19:05:17.382Z"}]
