THE ANATOMY OF ANATOMY OF A FALL - DAY</b>\r\n<i>Anatomy of a Fall</i> is an excellent film crafted from the mind of Justine Triet. It's beautifully acted, shot, scored and edited together. So let's look at the Anatomy of <i>Anatomy of a Fall</i>.\r\n \r\nStory:\r\nThe story revolves around the unconfirmed cause of death of <i>Samuel</i>, who has fallen out of his attic window. The only person in the house was his wife <i>Sandra</i>, <b>Sandra H\u00fcller</b>, the prime suspect. Their son <i>Daniel</i>, blind from an unfortunate event, is the only witness. The story is from the perspective of <i>Sandra</i>, and just like any courtroom drama, details are revealed over time. Fortunately, it's at a steady pace, never announcing too much or too little, giving us the correct information at the right time. While I'm mostly positive about the story, some moments slow right down, and we come to a standstill; overall, thanks to the following few components, they considerably make up for the story's flaws. \r\n\r\nPerformance: \r\nIts lead is <i>Anatomy of a Fall's</i> greatest asset, <b>Sandra H\u00fcller</b>. She is tremendous, pulling no punches in the role of Sandra, the deceased's wife. For the rest of the cast, no one except the dog is ever greater than Sandra! \r\n\r\nCinematography: \r\nThe camera in this film is on a swivel, always moving, keeping us engaged. The camera uses Visual humour quite a bit, which is always great to see. Finally, the colour grade felt natural and, at times, warm, giving a homely vibe. \r\n\r\nScore:\r\nA simple piano piece plays throughout the film; it is excellent. \r\nFinally, the editing:\r\nThis was a stand-out for me. It was cleverly cutting at points to hide us from the horrors but holding onto moments before it became too much. \r\nThere's a lot of love about this film \u2014 a highlight of the Cannes 2023 run. \r\n\r\n<b>FADE OUT.</b>", "created_at": "2023-05-29T17:13:44.011Z"}, {"movie_id": 915935, "review_id": "6474dd475cd16e00f9b0191c", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "<b>INT.
