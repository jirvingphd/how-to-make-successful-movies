This is a tale of a struggling writer who goes to a French seaside resort for an inspiration to write a new material. He takes his wife along and in the peaceful environment, seems they're doing well, until a newly married couple arrive for their honeymoon in their next door. All the complication surface and the old secrets are revealed, so that's how the film sets up and ends.\r\n\r\nI don't know what's with Jolie lately, she's not doing many films as she was before. Maybe her parenting commitment took over her acting career. Good to see her back, but seeing this film and its story, I feel she's really suffering that I don't know what it is. Some day in the near future if someone makes a film about her, that will reveal this time of her life. Anyway, they both looked great on the screen, but very sad they are parting away.\r\n\r\nThis is not some awesome story with twist and turns, just a straightforward drama, mostly the midlife crises in a married life. So here the performances were top notch, other than that is the beautiful locations. It's a two hour long film, not everybody feel comfortable with that, because the pace was very slow and the story is not that interesting. Particularly this film is not for the youngsters, but that does not mean all the grown-up would enjoy it either. Only some people find it better and for me this is an okay film.\r\n\r\n_6/10_", "created_at": "2016-09-29T21:33:36.821Z"}]
