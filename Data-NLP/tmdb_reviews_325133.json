I thought only people are reacting negatively, it could be much better than the previous one, but this is really a crap. I'm as a film fanatic hate myself to criticise a film like a film critic does, but there is no other option. I don't know who are the target audience, because it was too sexy for teens and definitely adults won't enjoy unless they are similar to what in the film depicted.\r\n\r\nI don't know why, but I disliked all film with Zac Efron in it. Beside, I'm disappointed in Chloe Grace joining this team. A bad decision, she will regret doing it in the future, maybe she's already. Regarding Seth and Byrne, I don't blame them doing this, at least theirs part were much better than the others. Yet there is no laughs, the film ran with totally dry. Maybe the youngsters would enjoy it than anybody else, because I'm sure the grown-up have already seen better ones in the similar style in the 80s and 90s.\r\n\r\nI hope this is it, no more sequels. Particularly not to end up like 'American Pie', but nobody can stop that if B filmmakers take over from here on. At least first film was much better compared between these two. If you are an adult, sure you should skip it. Zac and Chloe won the Teen Choice awards, so now you know who should watch it. No offense to those who liked it, but for me it is one of the top five worst films of the year. I never write the reviews like this, but I feel bad for what this film made me to do.\r\n\r\n_3/10_", "created_at": "2016-09-29T21:02:28.622Z"}]
