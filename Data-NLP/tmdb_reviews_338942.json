He and other riders pause at a village, which comes under enemy attack. Confused and reeling from the sudden violence, he fails to find a unit under attack, which is surrounded and wiped out.\r\nHe is arrested, stripped of rank, and quickly sentenced to death by firing squad. He tries to appeal to his superiors, but is thrown into a dugout prison, guarded by a central Asian soldier. He narrowly escapes the firing squad when the Germans overrun the base, and he flees with his very reluctant guard.\r\nWandering from place to place, trying to avoid Germans, the two become comrades-in-arms, when they are recruited to take a village held by the Germans. \r\nBut duty is duty for his guard, and they continue on their journey to headquarters, encountering many village-level people and places. It's an episodic movie, which leads to an interesting ending in Berlin, years later. 7/10", "created_at": "2018-09-16T05:57:40.163Z"}]
