I haven't seen that, after seeing this film now I want to try it. So this movie is like a bonus episode for its fans, and for the cast and crew it was a reunion for the one last time. But I want a sequel, because I kind of liked it without familiarity with the original story and its characters. Anyway, it did not give me any trouble in understanding, particular this story. But obviously I know I am missing something in those scenes that directly has something to do with the series.\r\n\r\nWhat a simple tale about the film industry. It actually centered on a bunch of Hollywood actors and producers. When a lead actor wanted to direct his next film for the new production house, he gets a green signal, but the problem arises after production halts in the half way due to exceeding the original budget. All the struggle they go through, especially the studio head who acts between the filmmakers and their financiers is what narrated in this film.\r\n\r\nI don't know what they thought of this those who saw the series, but to me it was a pretty good comedy. Because I had no pressure to expect or to compare it with the original material like they do. The cast was wonderful. I got quite an unexpected and enjoyable twist. Since it was related to the motion pictures, some big film personalities' cameo brightened the overall film. If you want your watch to be a perfect, go through from the beginning, but like I did, you too can have a good time without viewing the series. That's not a recommendation, but a small suggestion.\r\n\r\n7/10", "created_at": "2016-05-23T21:28:26.249Z"}]
