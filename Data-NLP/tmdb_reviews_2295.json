The film, however, managed to surprise me and give me more than I expected.\r\n\r\nThe action takes place about ten years after the first film (which is correct, the sequel only appeared ten years after the original) and shows how Dante, the central character of this plot, left his hated convenience store to work in a fast food restaurant. He's still not interested in the job, and hates the place, but he's engaged to a blonde beauty who plans to take him to Florida, where her father is going to give them a home. However, whoever is destined to be a Nobody cannot expect many strokes of luck, and he will, in a single day, throw everything away. Of course, Randal, his old buddy, will take his share of the blame for what happens.\r\n\r\nIf the first film failed for having no script, just a succession of intelligent but rude and uninteresting dialogues, this film corrected that flaw and gave the characters a decent story. However, decent does not mean good: although this was a great advance, the film has a huge romantic subplot that seems to have been written on a high school, because it works rather poorly and is unconvincing.

Thought to be the strong point of this film, the comedy is based on scatological, sexual and unhygienic humour. Jokes about poor hygiene in a restaurant or bestiality or several other sexual practices flow freely and abundantly, like a flood in a sewer after a storm.

The big improvement is really from O'Halloran, who showed a better job and talent to do something more challenging and competent.
