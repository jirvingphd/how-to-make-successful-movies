I have now watched all three for my french class and can say this movie elicits so much emotion. True to Jacques Tati's style this film does not need the viewer to understand what is being said to understand what is going on in the film. The art directors choice of stylization for the film makes it a work of art, literally. I absolutely adore this film and would recommend it and other Jacques Tati films to any one. 10/10 stars with 10 being the highest :)", "created_at": "2013-03-22T03:49:11.092Z"}]
