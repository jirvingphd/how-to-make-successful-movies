Simple and not very original with the usual slew of traitors strewn about, you cannot trust anyone, our hero becomes a fugitive etc etc bla bla bla. It is however a pretty straightforward one which works quite well and is not getting bogged down in silly emotions and general idiotic behavior by our hero like for instance several instalments of Spider Man have done. Actually this is one thing that I really like with this movie. The hero is a true hero from start to finish without any of that modern Hollywood crap where the hero must be tarnished in one way or another to satisfy the directors and producers.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above if you like superhero action movies then there is little not to like with this one.

Chris Evans does great work as the lead character, while Scarlett Johansson gives her most fun to watch performance in the MCU up until this point; it would've been great if she had such a role pre-<em>'The Avengers'</em>, so she wouldn't have felt so out of place to me in that.\r\n\r\nAnthony Mackie and Robert Redford are notable in their respective roles, as is Sebastian Stan - even if, to be honest, his character's connection with the lead didn't quite hit as hard as the film attempts - at least for me. I didn't really believe how his character came about and how Barnes acts throughout, Stan does well though. Samuel L. Jackson is also good.\r\n\r\nEverything else is exactly what you'd expect from a film of this size. Great effects, entertaining action and a satisfying story.

America\" (Chris Evans) finds himself seventy years older but still with battles to fight. This time, he teams up with \"Nick Fury\" (Samuel L. Jackson) and his SHIELD agent \"Natasha\" (Scarlet Johansson) to combat the ruthless warrior known only as the \"Winter Soldier\". It doesn't take us long to discover that there is quite conspiracy going on too - with an attempt on the life of \"Fury\" before off we go on a roller-coaster ride of action adventure scenarios. The effects are great and the score works well to help keep the break-neck pace working well and excitingly. Evans is still just a little too pretty-boy for me, but the developing roles of Anthony Mackie, Johansson and a few cameos from the somewhat duplicitous \"Pierce\" (Robert Redford) all contribute well to make this a superior adventure film with a strong and characterful story underpinning it. It hasn't quite the charm of the first film, so I wouldn't say it is better - but it is certainly just as good, and as with the first outing, the 2\u00bc hours just flies by.

The Russo Brothers took Captain America and immersed him in a dangerous world filled with subterfuge, spies, and betrayal. This was the first MCU film that didn\u2019t feel as bright and light-hearted as its predecessors, and this new tone fit Cap\u2019s story perfectly. The action was incredible. The plot twists kept piling up. Forcing Cap to question his moral compass and use his wits over his brawn to overcome his enemy were brilliant story decisions that developed the character and avoided the \u201cbad guy with the same powers as the hero trope.\u201d Black Widow\u2019s inclusion in this spy adventure allowed Natasha to shine and further develop her morality.
