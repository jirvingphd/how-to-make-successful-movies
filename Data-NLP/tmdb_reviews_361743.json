This movie doesnt have any complex story and some of it structure if im looking at it, kinda almost the same as the first one.

The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.\r\n\r\nThe overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final \"suicide\" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.\r\n\r\nThe performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.\r\n\r\nThis film is a blast, and I really wish I would have made the time to see it in theaters.

IMDb will block your reviews of this movie if you praise it.  Amazon (owned by the same company) is fudging the like ratio, and Youtube did the same with the trailer.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense.  It really does.\r\n\r\nMaverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  The white guy isn't evil.  America isn't evil.  It's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.\r\n\r\nFrom start to finish it's just a solid apolitical action movie.\r\n\r\nSo of course you are supposed to hate it, it literally breaks all the rules of modern Hollywood.\r\n\r\nAnd that was why it was the biggest blockbuster of the past few years.  That is why it had returns that would be a mega-bock buster pre-COVID.  It's the type of movie that people actually want to see, which is why it's under attack on certain sites.  You're not supposed to know that people like it and they weren't supposed to make a movie that people wanted to see.\r\n\r\nEverything has to be a propaganda piece.  \r\n\r\nBut you want to know a secret?  If this came out in the 80s it wouldn't have done well.  It's not as good of an action movie as they had back then.

Yes - it was worth the wait. The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous \"Top Gun\" pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of \"Rooster\" (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate \"Goose\" who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner \"Penny\" (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral \"Kazansky\" (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn't really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it's most competitive, but also at it's most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it.

It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.\r\n\r\nMonica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little clich\u00e9, though overall I approve.\r\n\r\nA great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.", "created_at": "2022-05-25T18:48:11.776Z"}, {"movie_id": 361743, "review_id": "6291388cd48cee0f2ab6246f", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/top-gun-maverick-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Top Gun: Maverick is the return of pure, nostalgic blockbusters, instantly becoming one of this year's personal favorites.

Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of conservatives reminiscing Reagan years would watch it, that should be enough to make it a hit.\r\n\r\nI think that is also the reason of the high score.

Yes - it was worth the wait. The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous \"Top Gun\" pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of \"Rooster\" (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate \"Goose\" who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner \"Penny\" (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral \"Kazansky\" (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn't really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it's most competitive, but also at it's most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it.

The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.\r\n\r\nThe overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final \"suicide\" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.\r\n\r\nThe performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.\r\n\r\nThis film is a blast, and I really wish I would have made the time to see it in theaters.
