It\u2019s rare for a film like this to be a mainstream release, and in the lacklustre year of 2019 I think it\u2019s about time we got something in cinemas that's original.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-another-tarantino-classic", "created_at": "2019-08-07T04:46:32.959Z"}, {"movie_id": 466272, "review_id": "5d5e9465f263ba752c944e09", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nQuentin Tarantino is one of the best filmmakers of all-time. He has undeniable talent behind the camera, and his movies are fated to leave a mark in each year they\u2019re released. In addition to that, he\u2019s also an extraordinary screenwriter, as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proves once again. His knowledge of the early decades of film is vast, so every feature he produces is always going to be filled with references to those \u201cfairy tale\u201d years. And that\u2019s precisely what this movie is: a fairy tale in Hollywood, hence its title. Let me just leave this here right off the bat: I\u2019m not going to address any controversy surrounding this film (namely, the whole Bruce Lee depiction and the Manson Family, in general), as I\u2019m always fair and impartial to the movie I\u2019m reviewing. Moving on \u2026\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the 60s isn\u2019t that good. Obviously, I know the whole Sharon Tate story, as well as the famous Manson murders, but when it comes to actual films from that decade, well \u2026 Probably, I only know a few by name, a classic scene, or a memorable soundtrack. Tarantino uses his large runtime to place tons of references to that period, and that\u2019s one of the reasons the first act of the movie drags. There\u2019s a lot of time spent with characters just driving cars while listening to music (references in the songs), wide shots of the city as they drive by (references in the buildings), or even just playing an LP and dancing to it (reference in the songs, again).\r\n\r\nI understand that these mean something, but if they don\u2019t develop the character in any way, then these are just Easter Eggs and have no impact on the actual narrative. The first hour or so is filled with sequences which sole purpose is to show how much Tarantino knows about that time, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, as long as it tells a story. That\u2019s the second issue I have with the first act: it takes too long to establish its characters, and there\u2019s no apparent objective within the story. It feels like a person just strolling around with no destination, which in itself isn\u2019t a bad thing. But if you put together repetitive sequences plus a story that no one knows where it\u2019s going or how it connects to the only thing people are actually expecting (the Sharon Tate event), then you\u2019ll bore the hell out of the audience (a lot of people constantly left my theater to get more food or something, and they weren\u2019t in a hurry).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, from the moment we start understanding who Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are, what they do, what they did, and what they want with their lives, then the film becomes incredibly captivating. It\u2019s definitely a character-driven story. It\u2019s a fairy tale where Rick tries his best to overcome his own personal issues to be the very best movie star, after being on an exponentially negative path. Cliff, as his stunt double, lives off of his buddy by doing everything he needs around the house and everywhere else. These two are inseparable, and their scenes are always filled with laughter and joy, even in the darkest moments. OUATIH works because of its beautifully-written characters.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t care about them, then you won\u2019t enjoy the film at all. In addition to this, if you don\u2019t know anything regarding the art of filmmaking, then you\u2019ll probably hate it since it will become extremely dull. It\u2019s one of those movies that anyone can like. However, for someone who knows and understands how films are made, it will always be a better time at the theater. You can love this movie, sure. But if you love filmmaking and you have knowledge of its techniques, you\u2019ll love it even more. There are so many technical achievements worthy of appreciation that I can\u2019t get to all of them, so I\u2019ll just address two of my favorites. The first has to be the black-and-white flicks inside the actual film. Putting Leonardo DiCaprio acting on classic westerns with over-the-top performances is an absolute delight. Watching those features in a 4:3 black-and-white screen, filled with classic sound effects, and cheesy one-liners \u2026 Wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe second allows for my favorite scenes of the whole movie: the extensive one-take dialogues. I mean, 10 or 15-minute sequences where DiCaprio just gives it his all. This is how every single film should be done. There\u2019s even a joke in the movie where Rick criticizes a particular type of filmmaking because they would film every character separately saying their lines and then editing them together. Unfortunately, that\u2019s how most features are done today. Therefore, from watching a simple dialogue scene with DiCaprio and Julia Butters (a 10-year-old little girl!) to a bar sequence which belongs to a movie Rick is filming (this one even has Rick asking his lines, and the camera has to go back to its starting point), everything with no cuts whatsoever \u2026 What can I ask more from a director?!\r\n\r\nObviously, if this is a character-driven narrative, the cast has to be genuinely compelling. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie \u2026 I mean, do I even need to explain how phenomenal they are? DiCaprio proves once again he\u2019s one of the greatest actors of all-time. The ability that he has to put 200% in every single scene is unbelievable. I even started to tear up once his character is able to find his footing, solely due to the actor\u2019s performance. The Oscar nom is guaranteed, let\u2019s see about the win. Brad Pitt also has tons of nominations on his lap with an astonishing supporting display. He has a subtle performance, but it\u2019s pretty incredible how much he can transmit to the audience by putting (apparently) so little effort. Margot Robbie doesn\u2019t have that much screentime, but her character had the simple objective of showing how glamorous and dreamy an actress\u2019 life could be at that time, so she didn\u2019t exactly need to deliver her A-game.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s always good to see Al Pacino (Marvin Schwarz) on-screen, and I\u2019m thrilled that Margaret Qualley (Pussycat), who I know from The Leftovers (one of the most underrated TV shows of the century), is finally getting some recognition. Technically, like I said above, it\u2019s close to a masterpiece. It\u2019s Tarantino, everyone knows what he\u2019s capable of, but having in mind his most recent features, it\u2019s a pleasant surprise and evidence of quality to the naysayers that he was able to produce a film with less bloody action. There are terrific demonstrations of great cinematography (Robert Richardson), and the editing is always impeccable in Tarantino\u2019s features (this time due to Fred Raskin). The score is addictive, and it carries a very significant role in the movie. I would say that if Tarantino was able to shorten its runtime and control its pacing better, this would be a technically perfect film.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isn\u2019t the best Quentin Tarantino\u2019s movie, but it\u2019s undoubtedly one of the year\u2019s best. Filled with award-winning lead performances (second Oscar for DiCaprio, please), this character-driven story is packed with references to the 60s which will be the divisive point in whether people will enjoy the film or not. Its first act is slow and takes too long to set up its story, but from the moment it\u2019s able to find its footing, it\u2019s an entertaining ride. If you love filmmaking and you know the insides of the art, Tarantino delivers a near-perfect technical production. Its alternate ending to real-life events is meant to be controversial, but for me, it\u2019s a vision of how everything should have happened if the world was fair or, indeed, a fairy tale \u2026 in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "created_at": "2019-08-22T13:11:01.302Z"}, {"movie_id": 466272, "review_id": "5d625e316dea3a746b9457e8", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "I'm not here to explain _Once Upon a Time In Hollywood_, just to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal.

Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie) & Roman Polanski are neighbors with Jay Sebring always hanging around (Emile Hirsch). Meanwhile the Manson Family nutjobs are lurking in the background, prepping to attack. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time\u2026 in Hollywood\u201d (2019) is Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 9th full film and, for me, ranks somewhere in the middle of his oeuvre. It may not be as great as \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994) and \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d (2012), but it places well with \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d (2009), \u201cJackie Brown\u201d (1997) and \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d (2015).  \r\n\r\nA famous director once succinctly defined a great movie as such: Three good scenes, no bad scenes. While the second part of this definition is debatable with \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\u201d seeing as how the movie could've certainly been tightened up (there are some dull sequences), there's no doubt that it fulfills the first part. \r\n\r\nMy three favorite scenes are: The amusing satirical Bruce Lee confrontation; the great Spahn Ranch episode, which effectively creates an underlying sense of menace; and, of course, the entertaining hippie attack in the final act.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there are numerous additional gems: The friendship and respect of Rick and Cliff; the audacious flamethrower sequence; Rick's breakdown with the precocious girl actor (not actress); the beautiful women throughout; the great cast, including several celeb cameos; the entertaining soundtrack; Brandi, the pit bull; Rick's meltdown in his trailer; Rick finally pulling off a quality acting scene via ad libbing; George Spahn not remembering Cliff; everything (surprisingly) turning out to be precisely as so-and-so said; the allusion to what MAY have happened to Cliff's nagging wife (Rebecca Gayheart) on the boat; the way it should have turned out on that infamous night; and the heartwarming close,\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-", "created_at": "2019-09-16T01:17:28.508Z"}, {"movie_id": 466272, "review_id": "5df015331dbc880014ac2336", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Well, the last 15-minutes were great, the first 2.5 hours on the other hand was... uneventful.

It\u2019s both aimless and yet meaningful with the commentary on the new era in Hollywood. The movie pays tribute to old Hollywood, film making, Sharon Tate, stunt work, and actors. This is perhaps Tarantino\u2019s most personal and mature movie his made, until the last 10 minutes (which I love) goes complete ape sh*t.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t think of any other director where the passion and love for movies is so transparent through Tarantino's craft. He\u2019s such an old school film maker that he and Martin Scorsese are the last golden age directors, as every new release feels like an event. In this movie, Quentin presents 69\u2019 Hollywood at its peak, as he remembers it from his childhood. He manages to rebuild classy LA thanks to the crew and creative team. \r\n\r\nBright neon lights, fashionable clothes, and late 60\u2019s automobiles. There\u2019s a couple of scenes where Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), drives around LA and there are long shots that shows off the environment and it\u2019s amazing the amount of detail and effort went into the setting - with Robert Richardson brilliant Cinematography bringing it all alive. \r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio was absolutely excellent as the fading Western star, Rick F**king Dalton. Dalton, a self-centered, yet vulnerable actor that you both laugh and pity. I will often forget about DiCaprio comedic chops, something similar to Ryan Gosling. I also like the subtle stutter that\u2019s sprinkled through out, which is sad when given some thought that it\u2019s something he\u2019s got to deal with. There\u2019s a heartfelt scene where Dalton tells his young co-star about a book his reading and mid way through explaining the story he realises it mirrors his life, and breaks down in tears with me crying with him. Yep, I teared up in a Tarantino movie. Leo was the pulse of the movie.\r\n\r\nBrad Pitt was amazing as the deadpan and cool Cliff Booth. This is probably my favorite performance from him. Cliff\u2019s main character trait is his strength and he demonstrates it multiple times, but leaves the scene before anything can escalate. The chemistry between Leo and Brad was electric. Pitt was the meat of the movie.\r\n\r\nMargot Robbie was an absolute delight portraying the late Sharon Tate. Despite her slim screen time, but whenever she has screen time, I couldn\u2019t help but smile. I instantly fell in love with her and it\u2019s painfully to think something so sweet and pure could be taken away from us by brainwashed zombies who don\u2019t deserve a life, just a jail cell. I thought her portrayal in the movie was a beautiful tribute and how they handle her gives new life into her legacy. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a great scene where Sharon Tate watches a movie in cinemas that\u2019s she\u2019s in, but instead of Margot Robbie re-creating those scenes, they just show the real Sharon Tate in the movie. Now people were left a bit confused over this decision, although it\u2019s clear to me that erasing the real Tate out of the movie would be more disrespectful to her memory, so leaving her in is a touching tribute to her career and her work. Robbie was the heart of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe other supporting cast all did terrific with the little screen time most of them had. Kurt Russell makes a welcoming return as a character that I assume is Stuntman Mike from 'Death Proof' - either way still a welcoming presence. He\u2019s also the narrator and I find it hilarious whenever he tries to pronounce Italian movie titles. Al Pacino was a blast to watch as the tight and yet colorful producer. Mike Moh portrayal of Bruce Lee may have sparked some controversy recently, but I thought he was entertaining regardless and I don\u2019t really think it mocks his legacy at all. I mean, this is the same director who made a four hour movie honoring the legend. Margaret Qualley was crazy good as the hippie girl who\u2019s brain washed into a cult family. It\u2019s crazy to know that Damon Herriman has played Charles Manson twice in the same year and month for this movie and the TV show \u2018Mindhunter\u2019, which you should totally check out by the way.\r\n\r\nJulia Butters, Luke Perry, Timothy Olyphant, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, and Damian Lewis - a stellar cast that did a stellar job.\r\n\r\nAfter letting the film sit for awhile, there\u2019s so many memorable lines that I would often catch myself recreating just from memory after seeing it twice. There\u2019s so many great moments as well. The lights of LA coming to life at the dust of dawn, or the suspenseful scenes that actually got me feeling tense watching it. Without spoiling anything, but the Spahn Ranch scene where the Manson family stares down a defenseless Cliff Booth as he tries to speak to an old friend was terrifying - reminds me of the opening scene of \u2018Inglorious Bastards\u2019, in terms of building up tension that you wait in anticipation to explode.\r\n\r\nStill, I think this is the best representation of the Manson family I\u2019ve seen in any movie...by portraying them as absolute buffoons.\r\n\r\nAnd of course with it being a Tarantino movie, the music is lost treasure revived for a modern generation. Always fantastic and incredibly catchy. I can\u2019t think of anything better than Cliff driving around LA with the song \u2018Bring a Little Lovin\u2019 playing in the background.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: I\u2019ve seen this movie twice already and I still have a desire to watch it again.
