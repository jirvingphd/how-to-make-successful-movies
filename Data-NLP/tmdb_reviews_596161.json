There is a lot of story available to mine for the entire cast of characters.  The movie does a good job of bringing those characters to life, but it still feels like it's only scratching the surface; only giving you a glimpse of what it's like for those characters.  The movie is based on a novel, and I'm now more likely to go read the novel to see if more is revealed.", "created_at": "2021-09-28T11:24:44.780Z"}]
