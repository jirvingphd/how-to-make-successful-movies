James Mangold is one of my favorite directors and tells this story powerfully through the Oscar-worthy performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. The acting, music, and directing are all phenomenal. Still, the story is so sad, and its conclusion, while happy, happens so abruptly that it doesn\u2019t feel resolved or satisfied after 2+ hours of drug addiction and hurting loved ones. Cash\u2019s faith and love for his family, which are well known, aren\u2019t represented in the movie and could have provided hope in this dark tale. I understand why this movie was such a huge award winner, but my escapist nature struggled to enjoy such a sad story.", "created_at": "2023-02-11T03:28:30.367Z"}]
