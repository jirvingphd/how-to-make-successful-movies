Will any of them make it out alive? \r\n\r\nThis is basically a meshing of \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d (1999) and \u201cOgre\u201d (2008), but without the tongue-in-cheekiness of the latter. There\u2019s also a little bit of \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d (1973/2006). Like \u201cBlair Witch\u201d the foul-mouthed protagonists become increasingly horrified in the foreboding forest and eventually turn on one another. But the sylvan cinematography is leagues superior due to the spectacular Romanian locations as opposed to the pedestrian film-work of \u201cBlair Witch\u201d in Maryland (which is understandable since the latter is a \u201cfound-footage\u201d flick).\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to give-away the creature, which isn\u2019t fully revealed until the last fifteen minutes, but it\u2019s basically a hybrid of the monsters in \u201cThe Relic\u201d (1997) and \u201cWendigo\u201d (2001), albeit bigger, and superior to both. The second half deviates from the book and people complain about it, but it\u2019s superior to the lame black metal cult of the book IMHO and you can\u2019t beat one potent sequence that smacks of hell-on-earth. There\u2019s also an intriguing element about achieving nigh-immortality at the price of submissive veneration. Despite these positives, the movie\u2019s a little uneventful and humdrum, plus it's lacking in the female department.                \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour 34 minutes and was shot entirely in Romania. WRITERS: Joe Barton wrote the script based on Adam Nevill\u2019s 2012 novel. CAST: The four protagonists are played by Rafe Spall, Arsher Ali, Robert James-Collier and Sam Troughton. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)", "created_at": "2018-02-14T20:00:27.760Z"}, {"movie_id": 433808, "review_id": "5a8f725e0e0a26399e007554", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "The Ritual is a monster movie with psychological ambitions and seemingly a decent budget. The j\u00f6tunn monster is actually quite good and so are the cyclic re-enactments of the early on liquor store trauma. Unfortunately the rest of the movie is as bland as the title and relies too much on exotism of the deep Swedish forests. Sadly even that component gets watered out and the endgame cultists seem to be some recycled wiccans from Scotland rather than pre-christians of northern Scandinavia.", "created_at": "2018-02-23T01:46:06.231Z"}]
