Personally, Diane Kruger makes this movie for me, and her beauty and sex appeal is off the charts.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun movie that just wouldn't be possible if they all had cellphones, but try not to think about it!  Don't forget to watch it twice.  The 2nd time will be the \"ahh ha\" moment for you, trust me.", "created_at": "2019-05-30T00:31:25.759Z"}]
