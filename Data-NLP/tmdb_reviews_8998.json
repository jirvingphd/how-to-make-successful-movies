Give me witty main characters with at least a modicum of chemistry, and a script that doesn\u2019t insult my intelligence, and I will not regret watching it.\r\n\r\nFriends with Money seems to hit the ground running with a stroke of originality in that it covers not just one couple, but a group of friends all located somewhere on the relationship success spectrum. They provide enough depth to each character that it didn\u2019t occur to me that the Jennifer Anniston character was probably the star, coming from the hugely successful show Friends, but to me this was a fine ensemble cast. Frances McDormand and Joan Cusack were great, for a start. There were a few cringeworthy moments, but not enough to distract my enjoying the performances. The ending for Anniston\u2019s character was a nice finishing touch also.", "created_at": "2023-03-11T20:54:21.342Z"}]
