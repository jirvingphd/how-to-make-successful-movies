Okay, cinema must have its creative freedom, and it is also necessary to fill information gaps (we don't know everything about the past), but even creative freedom must recognize logical limits.\r\n\r\nToday, we know without a doubt that Scandinavian navigators \u2013 who have been called \u201cVikings\u201d \u2013 were the first Europeans to arrive in North America. What we still don't know is whether they were aware of it! Could they have maintained contact with Native American people in the region where they landed? Personally, it seems clear to me. Were there conflicts? I don't know, archeology might discover more about this. Is it legitimate to say that the Vikings discovered America? Yes, if we find out that they knew they had arrived at another continent. Until then, no: not even Columbus had that awareness.\r\n\r\nThe film takes this first contact between Amerindians and Europeans and creates a story of blood and violence: on the one hand, the Amerindians are portrayed as simple, friendly peasants who live in harmony with nature and who have their land invaded, and the Nordics are bloodthirsty savages who kill for pleasure. Furthermore, the script uses the historical fact to draw a parallel with the future European colonization of America in which, supposedly, Europeans return to invade and massacre \u201cinferior\u201d peoples for the pleasure of seeing blood flow. These are parallels that I even understand, given the modern need to demonize any European colonization enterprise. Current society, especially in the Americas, feels the urgency to condemn the colonial past of the Old World, forgetting that it is a daughter of that same world and that it is not so different from what it was in the past, in vices and virtues.
