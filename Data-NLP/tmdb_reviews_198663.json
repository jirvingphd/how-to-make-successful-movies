The problem is that at the end, it simply stopped.  No dramatic reason for ending where it does, no resolution of \"why did the captors do this?\" .

Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a \u201cyoung adult\u201d movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.\r\n\r\nI did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way?\r\n\r\nSometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.\r\n\r\nBottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.\r\n\r\nSHARE THIS:", "created_at": "2017-12-22T14:59:06.227Z"}, {"movie_id": 198663, "review_id": "5ae763880e0a26104f00e231", "author_rating": 1.0, "review_text": "Don't bother.", "created_at": "2018-04-30T18:42:16.369Z"}, {"movie_id": 198663, "review_id": "5bb59b33c3a368150c008095", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Much better than the marketing would have you assume.\r\n\r\n_Final rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2018-10-04T04:46:43.996Z"}]
