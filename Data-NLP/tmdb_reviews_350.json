I was really pleased by the comedy caused by the bitchiness, pettiness and downright superficiality of everyone involved, which says SO much about contemporary civilization...and the climax and denouement, are both touching and so fitting. The strong writing and acting made this much better than it had any reason to be.", "created_at": "2016-08-05T01:06:53.104Z"}, {"movie_id": 350, "review_id": "60930d52e8d0b40029452d4e", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "The cast elevate this film up a lot.\r\n\r\nEverything else to do with <em>'The Devil Wears Prada'</em> is all perfectly fine don't get me wrong, but I most certainly wouldn't have enjoyed it as much without the cast. Meryl Streep does an excellent job portraying Miranda, while Anne Hathaway matches her as Andrea. Emily Blunt (Emily) is also enjoyable, as is Stanley Tucci (Nigel).\r\n\r\nI never, personally, held too much interest in the plot, it does get a little bit repetitive in parts. With that said, thanks to Streep & Co., it's still a film that's definitely worth watching.", "created_at": "2021-05-05T21:25:38.450Z"}]
