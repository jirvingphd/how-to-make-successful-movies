Unfortunately, the dog isn't the most artificial element of the movie.\r\n\r\nBesides being expectedly childish, incredibly formulaic, and exaggerated in every possible way, the characters and the main narrative are far from looking, sounding, and being authentic.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's a disappointingly hollow adaptation that kids will inevitably love, but adults will find it hard to endure.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C-", "created_at": "2021-12-15T22:19:18.029Z"}]
