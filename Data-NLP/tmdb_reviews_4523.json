Falling pray to the envious Queen \"Narissa\" (a few fleeting appearances from Susan Sarandon) who wants her power, as well as her beauty, \"Giselle\" finds herself crawling out of a manhole cover and arriving in modern day New York City.

Who will win her heart? Can they get back to their home land of \"Adalasia\"? I could have been doing with a little more animation mixed into this, but as it is, it is a quickly paced and enjoyable family drama with a decent degree of chemistry between Adams and the admittedly rather wooden, but easy on the eye, Dempsey. Marsden is probably the star for me, he manages to carry the character of chivalrous dope quite amusingly at times, and Spall always did manage these ever so humble, slightly obsequious, parts well too. Idina Menzel is here, yes, but no real chance for her to belt out any power ballads - indeed, the triple Oscar-nominated soundtrack is not one of Alan Menken's more memorable, I thought.
