This is an exceedingly long movie, yet it somehow can\u2019t or won\u2019t find the time or space to fit in a little logic.\r\n\r\nConsider the following. A group of British citizens go to Moscow to kill Rasputin, whom they believe to be a pernicious influence on the Tsar \u2013 and that he is, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Rasputin remains the Tsar\u2019s closest and most trusted advisor. One would not expect the Russian monarch to be too keen on continuing his alliance with England if he knew a bunch of English covert agents just assassinated, with extreme prejudice, his right hand man. Fortunately he never finds out \u2013 or at least doesn\u2019t appear to do so; the scene where the British cover up the murder and make it look like an accident or whatever has gone missing, presumably because it was never written, let alone shot.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I rather liked Rasputin\u2019s death scene, which recreates all manners of his fabled death (or, to be more specific, the myth surrounding it created by Prince Felix Yusupov); poison, beating, bullet wounds, and drowning in freezing water. This, by the way, is not a spoiler; first because it happens halfway through the movie (and in this case \u201chalfway\u201d means there\u2019s still a very long way to go), and second because his legendary demise is so well known it even has a trope named after it.\r\n\r\nYou know what else would not be a spoiler? The identity of the criminal mastermind behind the nameless organization \u2013 I would suggest OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym), were it not already taken \u2013 intent on wreaking havoc upon the world; identity which I will not reveal because it should be readily apparent to anyone familiar with the Law of Economy of Characters (in which a seemingly minor or unimportant character turns out to be much more crucial to the plot than they first appear to be). I will only add that the villain\u2019s uncanny ability to impossibly go from point A to a point beyond the alphabet, aided by little more than the requirements of the script, produces a plot hole so big a submarine could pass through it \u2013 and literally does.", "created_at": "2022-08-28T05:43:33.254Z"}, {"movie_id": 476669, "review_id": "63dd8e6addd52d00c6c85192", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "So, I did not expect this movie. Way darker than the previous ones. Still with humour, though. I really enjoyed it. Really well made. Good effects, good acting, surprising storyline. Did not find anything annoying, whicj rarely happens. I really like this one best of the three Kingsman.", "created_at": "2023-02-03T22:44:58.385Z"}]
