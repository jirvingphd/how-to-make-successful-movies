Jeepers Creepers Reborn, is, for my money, just another off the shelf, rather mediocre, knock off. \r\n\r\nThe story largely overlooks the factors that made the original film, so compellingly chilling. The slowly building tension, the gradual realisation that the pursuer is something worse than a garden house variety serial killer. In other words, the film \"creeps\" up on you. \r\n\r\nThis film plays more like a run of the mill slasher flick, without the jump scares. The results not frightening or even a little chilling. \r\n\r\nI'd describe everything else as \"alright\", from acting, sets through to \r\nhorror effects.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this one failed to resonate with me. I do not feel it came even close, to recapturing the essence of what made the original Creeper films disturbing cult icons of horror.", "created_at": "2022-10-05T20:47:59.955Z"}, {"movie_id": 717728, "review_id": "6359c41d8dbc33007e790730", "author_rating": 3.0, "review_text": "I must admit I was a bit excited when the names Jeepers Creepers popped up as a new movie because the memory of the first and second movie. This one started good enough and was doing fine until the end. The ending was so poorly written and performed that it ruined the whole enjoyment of the movie for me. Without spoiling it for those who want to be disappointed, the facial expressions lifting the toothpick and using dart physics shouldn't be the end product of professional writers.", "created_at": "2022-10-26T23:34:53.839Z"}]
