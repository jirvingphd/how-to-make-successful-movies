Not to mention I\u2019m an absolute sucker for the MCU. So after hearing that a very decent chunk of the fanbase thinking that not only was this the best Marvel film of the year (going up against _Winter Soldier_ and _Days of Future Past_), but that they would then go on to say it was the best Marvel Cinematic Universe film ever, you could imagine I was very surprised to find that I actually didn\u2019t think it was all that great.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want people thinking I didn\u2019t like it.
