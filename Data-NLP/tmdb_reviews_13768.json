That's not to say it's anything incredibly revolutionary, but it's a premise that they could've done so much more with. I won't spoil what the main thing is, but it's certainly interesting. The first half of the film is excellent, it just disappointingly doesn't go that extra mile.\r\n\r\nAlexis Bledel (how the heck is that <i>not</i> Robin Tunney?!) is enjoyable as Winnie, while Jonathan Jackson does well as Jesse. Ben Kingsley is, at least in my opinion, the best performer on display - I love the look of his character, who is elusively only referred to as \"The Man in the Yellow Suit\". Huge potential there.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I come way from this feeling underwhelmed - despite the film doing a lot of positive things, including the score. Shame.", "created_at": "2020-10-15T00:14:24.866Z"}]
