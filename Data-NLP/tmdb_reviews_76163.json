For me, it was mostly the action since some of these old guys are really\u2026well\u2026getting old. At least Stallone, Dolph and \u201cSchwarzy\u201d starts to get well past the best before date for these type of roles. Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme actually didn\u2019t look that old and Bruce Willis had a role where his age didn\u2019t make him seem too misplaced.\r\n\r\nThis movie is pretty much like the first The Expendables, that is some minimal story to build a whole bunch of action against. And action there is, lots of it. All of it quite well done although not always very realistic of course.\r\n\r\nIn general it seems like the so called \u201ccritics\u201d liked this movie more than the previous one. This I do not understand since I thought they were pretty similar and if nothing else, that the previous one was the better of them with a slightly more coherent and plausible plot. For instance, in this movie, old buddies where popping up out of nowhere saving their behinds with some pretty \u201cmagic\u201d display of firepower which felt like the scene was just put in there to get the actor into the movie\u2026which it probably was.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not complaining though. I wanted and expected an all-out action movie and that was what I got. Loads of action, macho-dialogue and cheesy jokes (I quite liked Schwarzy\u2019s comment about that Smart crapmobile that they drove around inside the airport). Oh, and of course loads of references to other movies (Rambo, Terminator\u2026) and stuff as well. They even managed to get a quote from Duke Nuke\u2019m in there.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed myself immensely when watching this movie.", "created_at": "2018-04-30T15:34:05.351Z"}]
