The challenge of presenting a sophisticated and sudsy exposition while incorporating the ghoulish gimmicky of zombies to elevate the surrealism and cynicism of the British-based costume drama is an ambitious taking to say the least. Thankfully, Steers delivers a halfway decent piercing period piece that accentuates both the elegance and eeriness of Austen\u2019s blossomed universe of early 19th century English femininity dripping with refined defiance and desire. Hence, Steers\u2019s somewhat choppy but inspired **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** provides an imaginative and slightly insane spin on the austere exuberance of Austen\u2019s classic romancer highlighted with the butt-kicking antics of the bombastic Bennett sisters.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that movie and television audiences throughout the years have been subjected to the omnipresence of the Jane Austen Experience through countless interpretations of her treasured **Pride and Prejudice** artistic works. For the most part, the radiance of Pride and Prejudice has always maintained its ravishing romanticism in the various incarnations showcased. However, Steers looks to promote a bloody-thirsty blueprint and enhance the urgent sense of Austen\u2019s femme fatale movement\u2013in this case unite the Bennett brood and arm them with the alertness of sinister-made sisterhood. Instinctively, the premise for **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** gives off a bizarre but refreshing vibe when distributing its wacky brand of subversive feminine liberation.\r\n\r\nAusten heroine Elizabeth Bennett has always been possessed in her personalized convictions especially when it came to love and stability. Nevertheless, **Zombies\u2019** Liz (Lily James) has a mission in mind that does not necessarily involve finding that ideal suitor of choice. In this case, Elizabeth and her sisters Jane, Mary, Kitty and Lydia (Bella Heathcoate, Mille Brasy, Suki Waterhouse and Ellie Bamber) are the sisterly slayers trained to eradicate the unwanted walking dead. The Bennett beauties, all skilled at exceptional swordplay courtesy of intensified training in China, are looked down upon within their elite social circles. Furthermore, the concern over the feisty Elizabeth and her siblings finding their soulmates rests on the shoulders of their worrisome parents Mr. and Mrs. Bennett (Charles Dance and Sally Phillips). What is to become of the vast Bennett estate should their offspring not find the eligible companions to continue the bloodline? The question remains: will the bashing Bennett babes go down in family history as courageous zombie huntresses  or suffer the societal humiliation as available spinsters untouched?\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s preference is to be vigilant in her quest to zap out the zombie presence whenever possible as opposed to obsessing over whether she will hook the grand love of her life. Still, the very idea of meeting Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley) at one of the festive balls may have at least humbled the combative Elizabeth a bit and had her entertain the notion of embracing a romantic feeling. Unfortunately duty calls and the agenda for terminating the pesky zombies as they invade the region is the top priority for Bennett brigade.\r\n\r\nActually, **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a frenetic fable that solidly works because it is able to competently marry two ubiquitous genres\u2013zombie B-movies with prim and proper Austen period piece adaptations\u2013and come up with a quirky and contentious commentary on female-oriented resistance and rage. Steers rips into the convention of womanhood wonderment with a horror flick romancer that has its sheer of nuanced nerve and chilly-minded charm. The gory shenanigans and showy execution of Zombies\u2019  cinematic makeup from Remy Adefarasin\u2019s luscious cinematography to David Warren\u2019s production design and Julian Day\u2019s costume designs all mesh with noted symmetry. The balance of wit, suspense, terror and tirade as the Bennett bunch and their suitors engage in swagger as they eliminate the detestable zombies feels delectable in manufactured naughtiness.\r\n\r\nThe performances are steady and give substance to the welcomed wackiness that uncannily defines this effectively compelling but twisted treat to Austen\u2019s pretty protagonists dressed up in gorgeous gowns that conceal their blood-laced daggers. As the lead Bennett sister, James is rather engrossing as the impulsive sword-swinging sass as her unique spin on Austen\u2019s curly-haired creation is as credible and creative as say Keira Knightley\u2019s stamp on the Elizabeth Bennett role.  Although rollicking in a zombie B-movie without relying too much on the crutch of high stakes camp, James and her supporting players are quite poised to go with the flow based on what the unpredictable material hands them.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a serviceable spectacle that dares to weave a Victorian-cultured social class romance yarn with an undead creepfest while finding a common ground in the hidden psyche of the young woman\u2019s destined determination for self-discovery.

Hence, Steers\u2019s somewhat choppy but inspired **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** provides an imaginative and slightly insane spin on the austere exuberance of Austen\u2019s classic romancer highlighted with the butt-kicking antics of the bombastic Bennett sisters.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that movie and television audiences throughout the years have been subjected to the omnipresence of the Jane Austen Experience through countless interpretations of her treasured **Pride and Prejudice** artistic works. For the most part, the radiance of Pride and Prejudice has always maintained its ravishing romanticism in the various incarnations showcased. However, Steers looks to promote a bloody-thirsty blueprint and enhance the urgent sense of Austen\u2019s femme fatale movement\u2013in this case unite the Bennett brood and arm them with the alertness of sinister-made sisterhood. Instinctively, the premise for **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** gives off a bizarre but refreshing vibe when distributing its wacky brand of subversive feminine liberation.\r\n\r\nAusten heroine Elizabeth Bennett has always been possessed in her personalized convictions especially when it came to love and stability. Nevertheless, **Zombies\u2019** Liz (Lily James) has a mission in mind that does not necessarily involve finding that ideal suitor of choice. In this case, Elizabeth and her sisters Jane, Mary, Kitty and Lydia (Bella Heathcoate, Mille Brasy, Suki Waterhouse and Ellie Bamber) are the sisterly slayers trained to eradicate the unwanted walking dead. The Bennett beauties, all skilled at exceptional swordplay courtesy of intensified training in China, are looked down upon within their elite social circles. Furthermore, the concern over the feisty Elizabeth and her siblings finding their soulmates rests on the shoulders of their worrisome parents Mr. and Mrs. Bennett (Charles Dance and Sally Phillips). What is to become of the vast Bennett estate should their offspring not find the eligible companions to continue the bloodline? The question remains: will the bashing Bennett babes go down in family history as courageous zombie huntresses  or suffer the societal humiliation as available spinsters untouched?\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s preference is to be vigilant in her quest to zap out the zombie presence whenever possible as opposed to obsessing over whether she will hook the grand love of her life. Still, the very idea of meeting Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley) at one of the festive balls may have at least humbled the combative Elizabeth a bit and had her entertain the notion of embracing a romantic feeling. Unfortunately duty calls and the agenda for terminating the pesky zombies as they invade the region is the top priority for Bennett brigade.\r\n\r\nActually, **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a frenetic fable that solidly works because it is able to competently marry two ubiquitous genres\u2013zombie B-movies with prim and proper Austen period piece adaptations\u2013and come up with a quirky and contentious commentary on female-oriented resistance and rage. Steers rips into the convention of womanhood wonderment with a horror flick romancer that has its sheer of nuanced nerve and chilly-minded charm. The gory shenanigans and showy execution of Zombies\u2019  cinematic makeup from Remy Adefarasin\u2019s luscious cinematography to David Warren\u2019s production design and Julian Day\u2019s costume designs all mesh with noted symmetry. The balance of wit, suspense, terror and tirade as the Bennett bunch and their suitors engage in swagger as they eliminate the detestable zombies feels delectable in manufactured naughtiness.\r\n\r\nThe performances are steady and give substance to the welcomed wackiness that uncannily defines this effectively compelling but twisted treat to Austen\u2019s pretty protagonists dressed up in gorgeous gowns that conceal their blood-laced daggers. As the lead Bennett sister, James is rather engrossing as the impulsive sword-swinging sass as her unique spin on Austen\u2019s curly-haired creation is as credible and creative as say Keira Knightley\u2019s stamp on the Elizabeth Bennett role.  Although rollicking in a zombie B-movie without relying too much on the crutch of high stakes camp, James and her supporting players are quite poised to go with the flow based on what the unpredictable material hands them.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a serviceable spectacle that dares to weave a Victorian-cultured social class romance yarn with an undead creepfest while finding a common ground in the hidden psyche of the young woman\u2019s destined determination for self-discovery. Perhaps introducing the less literate crowd to Jane Austen\u2019s brand of high class sensibilities through the battling Bennetts during the onslaught of an English countryside zombie invasion would make other future **Pride and Prejudice** installments feel more renewed and receptive.\r\n\r\n**Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr, 49 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Lily James, Sam Riley, Jack Huston, Bella Heathcoate, Douglas Booth, Matt Smith, Charles Dance, Sally Phillips, Suki Waterhouse, Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady\r\n\r\nDirected by: Burr Steers\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Fantasy\u2019Romance and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016", "created_at": "2016-02-06T08:08:48.594Z"}, {"movie_id": 58431, "review_id": "57d7612dc3a3682a87001222", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "Better than it had any right being, but still not very good.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._", "created_at": "2016-09-13T02:15:09.644Z"}, {"movie_id": 58431, "review_id": "5851a58a9251416f1001a227", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "**From loathing to romance and zombie hunting!**\r\n\r\nI did not know there was a parody novel of Jane Austen's 200 years old classic. This was based on that, a multi-starrer film, but the lack of star value let down the film. This is the film with a familiar plot, in addition to that zombies were there, but that was not enough. The big names from the cast would have pulled the film out of the box office disaster if it had one or two. But still I think this film was okay, an acceptable with awesome production and performances.\r\n\r\nIt ended like there will be a sequel, but now I don't think there's going to be one. The story was kind of predictable. Well, I did predict, particularly the character Wickham. Though I was more curious about the Zombies, like how it was going to be used in the narration. I must say, they were excellent. I mean they were not given any big preference, but theirs part indeed helped to build a nice plot. Pretty well composed stunts. I mean carefully, without strong blood and gore, so they got PG13 and warning for the violences.\r\n\r\nI think the film critics overreacted like usual. They're like the sheep herds, they follow one another and given verdict for this as a bad flick. But as a film fanatic, I don't think it is worth neglecting, especially if you are a fan of the original story. In the todays world, the critics are a bunch of circus clowns. So I hope you make a right choice on this, not because of me or the critics, if you haven't seen it yet.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_", "created_at": "2016-12-14T20:03:22.067Z"}, {"movie_id": 58431, "review_id": "63cae550cee481008efe0345", "author_rating": 1.0, "review_text": "**An absolute disgrace, for everyone involved. They killed Jane Austen!**\r\n\r\nI already had an idea that this movie was bad when I decided to see how bad it was. Unfortunately, the film is about as bad as it gets, cloyingly and terribly unhappy mixing up \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d, \u201cSeven Samurai\u201d and \u201cWalking Dead\u201d. There are no surprises here, the movie is what it says it is.\r\n\r\nWhat would Jane Austen say? I think she would gladly eat the brains of Burr Steers and Seth Grahame Smith, if they were medically proven to have brains. After seeing this crappy movie, I personally have doubts about it. The movie tried to update or give us a different version of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d\u2026 but instead it spit in Jane Austen's face full force. If I were the author, I would take this film as an insult. It's just stupid, idiotic, unintelligent and brutally crazy.\r\n\r\nIt's one of those movies where, quite simply, nothing works. There is no saving material here, no redeeming qualities. Scenery, costumes? Forget it\u2026 it was all a masquerade. CGI, action scenes? It looks like a video game without life or soul, with fight scenes choreographed to the millimeter, like a theater ballet. The actors? All the characters were meticulously run over by a script that should have been burned in the fireplace. If I were an actor, I would not have accepted to work in this film.\r\n\r\nI can't write anything else. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to stop here, I need to throw up.", "created_at": "2023-01-20T19:02:40.091Z"}]
