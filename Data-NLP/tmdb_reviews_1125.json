She is \"Effie\" whom, along with \"Deena\" (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles) and \"Lorrell\" (Anika Noni Rose), form a trio of singers aspiring to fame and fortune. Along the way, they encounter the usual suite of difficulties - bigotry, racism and misogyny as well as having to deal with their own personal rivalries. They are signed by Detroit used car salesman \"Curtis\" (Jamie Foxx) to back his established, womanising, star \"James Early\" (Eddie Murphy) and soon their star seems fixed. That is, until \"Curtis\" decides to dispense with the services of the temperamental \"Effie\" and with those of \"Early\" as he sees his vision for these talented and enigmatic women really take off. At times, it does stray a little too close to domestic melodrama, but for the most part this is a cracking story of how these women prove their own mettle. They regale against the male-dominated music business; increasingly try to assert themselves not just in the industry but with their management but, towards the end, with there own personal relationships before a powerful and vindicating denouement. Henry Kriegen and Tom Eyon have written some strong and powerful lyrics for the ladies to belt out with aplomb, particularly the title song, \"It's All Over\" and the show stopping \"One Night Only\". The production detail, photography and general pace of the film really do make for an an engaging watch; the performances are vibrant and frequently the emotion they generate is compelling to watch. Foxx is not the best, to be fair - especially when he bursts into song, but Murphy fares a bit better on that front and all told, this is an entertaining look at just how these women took on and defeated a system and a society that was stacked against them from the start.
