It's the usual old who has got the launch codes mystery that sees Sly Stallone's \"Barney\" recruit his best mate \"Christmas\" (Jason Statham) and their lethal gang of expendables to thwart the ambitions of an unknown criminal mastermind who is hoping to arm a boat load of nuclear missiles and start WWIII.

Plenty of pyrotechnics, a bit of contrived sexual chemistry (with Megan Fox's \"Gina\") and loads of bullets and missiles flying around keep the film moving along well enough, but the story is the thinnest of the thin; the baddie's identity is hardly a challenge to discover nor is the twist in the tale at the end remotely unexpected.
