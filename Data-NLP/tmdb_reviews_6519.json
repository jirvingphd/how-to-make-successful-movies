I have an issue with Confederate Battle Flag, which was much more widely accepted when the series was first created vs this remake, but even ignoring that it's about moonshine runners getting away with horrible driving practices and whatever else they can get away with.  They're not good guys, they're just less bad, and maybe that's part of the appeal for some people.\r\n\r\nI went into this knowing that Johnny Knoxville (\"Jackass\") and Seann William Scott (\"American Pie\": Stifler) are both really funny, and at least Jessica Simpson is pretty, but she's not the Siren they present her to be, but comedy.  On the boys' side, you get pretty much what you would expect, but nothing surprisingly good.  Though there is a scene where they're pretty much thankful to be arrested because they're about to be killed for a \"black face\" joke.  I'll admit the context is pretty nuanced and well handled, but they also...could have just not done it.\r\n\r\nI'm stretching for good bits, and the best thing is probably the script.  The actual story of two average idiots trying to save their town from an evil capitalist they do is actually pretty good.  Imagine the \"evil oil baron\" bit from \"The Muppets\", but they're country boys.\r\n\r\nIt's not a complete waste, but it's definitely not a movie that I'd recommend or sit down to watch with someone.", "created_at": "2020-10-23T18:09:19.651Z"}]
