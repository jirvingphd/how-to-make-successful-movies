Tommy then desserted his regiment and decided to enter the Sparta tournament to win a prize money as a promise to his friend's family (this shows that he does have a kinder side, even for a biref moment). He turns to his father to train him, but still resenting him for the past. But near the end, he sees his father relapsed and drunk (as drunk as he was in the past) and seeing how sad it all looks, Tommy realised he wasted all that anger over a broken down drunk and (may implied) forgave him (which was a sweet moment).\r\nPaddy is the father to Brendan and Tommy, but he lost them both (and his wife) when he was an abusive alcoholic. He regretted his actions and went sober. He tries yet fails to reconcile with both sons for the past. While Brendan had fogiven him (but don't trust him), Tommy still held that anger. Eventually, Paddy became heartbroken that Tommy will never forgive him and so he relapsed and got drunk. This inadvertantly changed Tommy's perspective his of father.
