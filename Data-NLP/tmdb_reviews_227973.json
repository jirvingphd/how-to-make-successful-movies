After 'Tintin', 'Doraemon', 'Asterix', 'Mr Peabody' 'Winnie' and a few others, now this movie joined the club. I'm waiting for many more like 'Garfield', 'Kim Possible', 'Calvin & Hobbes' et cetera to make its way.\r\n\r\n'Peanuts' characters considered one of the beautiful cartoon characters, just like 'Calvin & Hobbes'. They're simple drawings, yet very cute and delightful. These are mostly best suited to render in 2D animation, so till I watch them in 3D I always had a curiosity and doubts. This film is still a mix of both styles  - like eyes, mouth, dusts and in the side view, it was 2D drawing, but overall characters and backgrounds are 3D.\r\n\r\nIt was so good movie, for the 90 minutes I became a child again. As usual, there were two tales, one was Snoopy's fictional account and the others' Charlie Brown's crush on a little red-haired girl. Both of them were great, but I liked Charlie's a lot.\r\n\r\nOnce the animation was considered only for the kids, but now the world sees it differently. This film had an excellent box office. So definitely there will be a sequel. My only upset is it failed to do good at Annie awards, but anyway, like Disney studio says, that award ceremony is a joke and a disgrace to animation and animation (movie) fans.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd/10", "created_at": "2016-03-24T13:44:50.836Z"}, {"movie_id": 227973, "review_id": "57bd037fc3a3682eac00e18a", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "I was pretty far from enthralled. However, I do say that we the caveat of, I am definitely not the target audience for this. I am too young to have grown up with the original _Peanuts_, and have that nostalgia, but also too old to be in the demographic for your average kid's movie. And even I must praise the animation style. The blending of the original hand-drawn design with the 3D CGI made for a truly unique visual aesthetic that I found very impressive.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._", "created_at": "2016-08-24T02:16:31.547Z"}]
