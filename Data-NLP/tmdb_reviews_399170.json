Not enough to make it a bad movie, not at all, but still to the point of minor aggravation.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "created_at": "2018-01-05T04:00:24.053Z"}, {"movie_id": 399170, "review_id": "63767d3a11c066008e9a33d4", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "I'm not the biggest fan of Daniel Craig but here is one of his more charismatic performances as \"Joe\". Incarcerated, he is roped into helping brothers \"Jimmy\" (Channing Tatum) and \"Clyde\" (Adam Driver) into planning and executing a daring heist at the famous Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race. First things first, though, they have to work out a plan to get \"Clyde\" into jail, then to get him and \"Joe\" out for long enough to carry out their robbery, then get themselves back inside just in time to provide for a cast iron alibi before they are released to spend their ill-gotten millions. This is what Steven Soderbergh does well: a well written action adventure with some humour, strong characterisations and a decently paced storyline that really does pass two hours enjoyably. Tatum ditches his muscle-bound look, Driver has some fun with (and without) his war-earned prosthetics and the blonde-shorn Craig rules the roost with his most engaging role to date. It looks like it took a bit of inspiration from \"11 Harrowhouse\" (1974) with a soup\u00e7on of \"Robin Hood\" and \"the Dukes of Hazard\" thrown in too, making for an enjoyably lighthearted outing for all concerned.", "created_at": "2022-11-17T18:28:10.729Z"}]
