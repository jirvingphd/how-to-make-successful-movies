FADE IN:

INT. ORDINARY APT. (VEGAS) - LATE AFTERNOON (1997)

The sun-spotted hand of an old man adjusts a radio dial.

                         RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                (on radio)
           It's a beautiful jackpot of a day
           here in Las Vegas and, you guessed
           it, the biggest song of 1997...

The jaunty Euro hit "Macarena!" plays as a frail,
corpulent MAN ascends a ladder and strains to lift a box
marked, "CHRISTMAS CARDS, 1997."

Annoyed by the music, he flicks the dial again: ear-
splitting white noise.

THUD! He crashes onto the floor. CHRISTMAS CARDS are
splayed around him.

                         OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
           I know what you're thinking... who
           the hell is this Colonel fellow?

The man's fleshy, grey face gasping desperately. This is
COLONEL TOM PARKER (87).

We TRACK ACROSS him to the Christmas cards: a portrait of
Elvis, magnificent, king-like, beside the old man
dressed in an ill-fitting Santa suit. An inscription
reads: "Merry Christmas, from Elvis and the Colonel."

                                                SMASH CUT TO:


EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - DUSK

SIRENS BLARE! As an AMBULANCE screams through the neon
heart of Sin City, we hear...

                         RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
           Colonel Tom Parker, legendary
           manager of Elvis Presley, has been
           rushed to Valley Hospital...


INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

LOOKING DOWN ON: Colonel. Eyes closed. Dead-looking.
MEDICS attempt to revive him.




                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                                        2.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             There are some who'd make me out
             to be the villain of this here
             story...


EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - DUSK

The ambulance races past the International Hotel.

The CAMERA WHIP PANS TO its towering sign: "THE STAR TREK
EXPERIENCE: BOLDLY GOING WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE."

The sign SPINS ON ITS AXIS as we JOURNEY BACK TO the
International of the 1970s. The sign now heralding:
"ELVIS!"


EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - PORTE COCHERE - NIGHT (1974)

We STREAM ALONG WITH the ELVIS FANS pouring out of limos
and THROUGH the hotel's glass doors...

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Who'd say I exploited the boy and
             stole all his money...

A CAMERA CREW shoots 16MM FOOTAGE of CROWDS being ushered
through the lobby. QUICK CUTS of every possible
permutation of merchandise being snatched up by the
adoring crowds.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Trapped him in Vegas and enabled
             his drug addiction...


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SERVICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

SPLASH! We're UNDERWATER. A DROWNED MAN, pale face
obscured by long, black tendrils of hair...


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT

Onstage, a WARM-UP COMEDIAN cracks cheesy gags.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - CASINO - NIGHT

By a roped-off craps table, a gold trolley stacked high
with chips. A small crowd looks on as a gruff-looking
security guard, RED WEST, ushers in the beige TOM DISKIN.
He leans in to the cigar-puffing silhouette of the
Colonel, whispering in his ear.

                                                 (CONTINUED)
                                                         3.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             And eventually, when I had
             squeezed all I could out of him...


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SERVICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

SUDDENLY: THE DROWNED MAN is pulled by his hair from a
bucket of ice water! This is ELVIS PRESLEY (38).

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             ... I destroyed him.

TILT UP as a still corpulent, but younger, 64-YEAR-OLD
COLONEL enters, brandishing his elephant-headed cane. He
takes in the situation before him.

Elvis has collapsed on the floor. His bodyguards, SONNY
and Red West, hold staff at bay. Childhood friend JERRY
SCHILLING shoots a recriminating glance at the Colonel.

NURSE TISH suppresses panic as DR. NICK holds Elvis' head
above a bucket of ice water. Everyone looks to Colonel.

                            OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             That's right. It was me who killed
             Elvis Presley.

Colonel's steely gaze. A frightening moment of
consideration as we hear...

                           COLONEL
             Now, you listen up real good. The
             only thing that matters is that
             that man gets on that stage
             tonight!

But then, Nurse Tish pipes up courageously.

                           NURSE TISH
             If he was my son...

She glances to a grey-haired man with a pencil mustache
arriving meekly in the shadows. This is VERNON PRESLEY
(57). Elvis' father.

                           NURSE TISH
             ... I'd put him in the hospital.

Suddenly cold, off-handed:

                           COLONEL
             Of course, it's a Presley
             Enterprises decision, Vernon...

All eyes on Vernon.
                                                        4.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT

The comic, running out of gags, stalls for time. The
crowd grows restless at their tables.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SERVICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

After an eternity, Vernon mumbles:

                        VERNON
          What can you do for him, Dr. Nick?

Dr. Nick pops open his BAG OF TRICKS. WE GLIMPSE: MEDS,
PILLS, SYRINGES. As Dr. Nick prepares an injection...


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! A thunderous drum roll...

As now we see IMAGES in the style of A SUPERHERO DONNING
HIS COSTUME: WHITE JUMPSUIT! DIAMOND-ENCRUSTED PRIZE-
FIGHTER BELT! 9MM SLIPPED INTO HIS LEFT BOOT, GOLD PPK
SLIPPED IN HIS RIGHT! CHRISTIAN, JEWISH, AND BUDDHIST
BLING! THE LIGHTNING BOLT NECKLACE ALREADY IN PLACE!!!

AN AMERICAN EAGLE CAPE SPREADS ITS RHINESTONE WINGS!

                       ELVIS
               (sings)
          Glory! Glory!!! Halleluuuujah!!!

The eagle turns to REVEAL: Superhero Elvis, reaching for
the final divine notes, spreading his wings up to God...

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          His truuuuth is maaaarching
          ooooonnnnn!!!!!!!!

The ballad crescendos! Elvis' giant band lashes their
instruments. Two gospel choirs: one white, one Black.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          His truuuuth is maaaarching
          ooooonnnnn!!!!!!!!

As the last chords thunder through the night, we GO TO...
                                                       5.


EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - NIGHT

The Elvis sign has transformed back into "The Star Trek
Experience." With a BEEP, BEEP, we--

                                        JUMP CUT BACK TO:


INT. VALLEY HOSPITAL - COLONEL'S ROOM - NIGHT (1997)

The `90s Hilton seen THROUGH the window. Colonel lies in
a hospital bed.

The Colonel jolts upward.

                        OLD COLONEL
          No!... It's not true. I didn't
          kill him... I loved him. I didn't
          kill him. But I know who did.

He looks up to the morphine drip. The BEEP, BEEP of the
heart monitor transforms into a MUSICAL PULSE as morphine
snakes down a plastic tube into the Colonel's arm.

                        OLD COLONEL
          It weren't me...

Colonel slowly pulls back the bedsheets and stands,
taking his IV stand with him. We TRACK ACROSS get well
paraphernalia. A red balloon appears, seemingly part of
the get well gifts. Colonel is drawn toward it.

                        OLD COLONEL
          And it weren't nothing to do with
          what them dirt farmers and
          muckrakers wrote up in all them
          books.

The beat kicks in, balloon in one hand, IV stand in the
other. He shuffles down the corridor to the music.

                        OLD COLONEL
          Evil manager? I wasn't his
          manager! I was his promoter! It
          was my job to present him to you.
          To sell, package, and make money
          in every conceivable way! And I
          did!

As he glides down the corridor, a photo of Elvis and
Colonel appears.

                        OLD COLONEL
          Elvis, the showman, and the
          Colonel, the snowman.

                                              (CONTINUED)
                                                         6.
CONTINUED:

Colonel's elephant-headed cane appears in his hand and he
gestures towards the walls, now collaged with snapshots
of Colonel and Elvis.

                           OLD COLONEL
             There are thousands of photos of
             me and my boy...

A collage of a thousand images now sprawls across both
sides of the corridor.

                           OLD COLONEL
             Huddled, plotting, planning, and
             whispering! Only I know what we
             talked of. I know what was said.

The hospital hallway gives way to a corridor of Elvis
merchandise, packed with stuffed hound dogs, calendars,
buttons, hats and more balloons.

                           OLD COLONEL
             But I never wrote no book. I never
             sold my story. I never told the
             real story. I never told the truth
             about me and my boy. I never
             talked...

The Colonel dons a boater hat.

                           OLD COLONEL
             ... until now!!

CUT TO a gold curtain rising to reveal: Old Colonel, now
resplendent in a striped blazer, every inch the carnival
barker, miming along to a contemporary, orchestral
version of Elvis' song, "Carnival Time." Colonel sashays
and warbles down a staircase into SPACE.

                           OLD COLONEL
                  (miming to Elvis)
             Come on kids from eight to eighty
             Hey there, mister, bring your lady
             There's a big show on the inside
             It's carnival time!

He balances on a tightrope above an abstract Vegas Strip.

                           OLD COLONEL
                  (miming to Elvis)
             Popcorn, peanuts, and cotton candy
             Pink lemonade that's dan-dan-dandy
             Be a big shot for a dollar.
             It's carnival time!



                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                                         7.
CONTINUED: (2)

Grabbing a bunch of balloons, he glides down off the
tightrope. He spins a roulette wheel, taking us back in
time...

Colonel, now with a stick-and-bindle over his shoulder,
runs along a WIGGLY CARPET that leads to a far-away model
of a 1930s carnival.

                        OLD COLONEL
          As an orphan, I ran away to the
          carnival, where I learned my
          trade... the snow job.

PUSH IN on a red curtain touting "Tom Parker's Famous
Dancing Chickens."

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          Tom Parker's Famous Dancing
          Chickens!

Curtains fly open to reveal Old Colonel in front of a
stage on which ordinary chickens cluck about. A band
plays side-stage. A group of RUBES watches, intrigued.

                        OLD COLONEL
          Ladies and gentleman, direct from
          the deepest jungles of Peru... The
          high-kicking chorus line of the
          Barnyard Ballet!

CLOSE ON Colonel as he reveals the gas burners, secretly
heating the underside of the stage.

                        OLD COLONEL
               (to camera)
          Now then... the snow job! The art
          of emptying a rube's wallet while
          leaving them with nothing but a
          smile on their face.

As the plates heat up, the chickens appear to dance. The
rubes applaud! A mystical, minor-chord version of
"Carnival Time" begins.

                        OLD COLONEL
          It was also in the carnival that I
          learned from the great Madame
          Zeena...

Colonel gestures to a caravan and we ZOOM TOWARDS it to
find MADAME ZEENA, a fortune teller gazing down into a
crystal ball.

CONTINUED: (3)

                        OLD COLONEL
          The dark arts of hypnotism,
          mentalism, and how to read a man's
          greatest flaws and desires.

We see Colonel inside the ball, a backdrop of a European
village behind him. He waves his elephant cane to the
CAMERA, hypnotizing us, and throws cash in the air. As
the cash floats downward, it becomes falling snow.

                        OLD COLONEL
          Of course, any promoter is limited
          by the draw of his attraction.

We TRACK ACCROSS posters of the carnival oddities....
MERMAID MONSTER, LOBSTER BOY, ALIGATOR MAN.

                        OLD COLONEL
          I had my acts... the Mermaid
          Monster, Lobster Boy...

A young man (the silhouette of Elvis) stands in front of
THE GEEK poster.

                        OLD COLONEL
          But the act that always made the
          most snow is the one that excited
          the audience with what they truly
          feared and desired.

Old Colonel's sun-spotted claw reaches out towards the
silhouette...

                        OLD COLONEL
          The Geek...

Colonel pulls a lever and suddenly, jackpot on the slot
machine! `DING DING DING' Elvis and Geek heads. Colonel
dances along a HALL OF MIRRORS in which we see
reflections of Elvis.

                        OLD COLONEL
               (miming to Elvis)
          Roustabouts are roustabout'n
          And there's happy shouts, children
             shoutin'
          If you've got doubts quit your
             doubtin'

We see teddy bears reflected in the mirrors!

                        OLD COLONEL
               (miming to Elvis)
          There's thrills...

Hound dogs reflected in the mirrors!

                        OLD COLONEL
               (miming to Elvis)
          It's spice...

Rows and rows of merchandise fill the mirrors!

                        OLD COLONEL
          It's cheap at half the price!

Colonel sings as he bobs along on his Jamboree cart,
pulled by elephants. Inanimate merchandise comes to life
and marches along behind him! Thanksgiving Day Parade-
style hound dog balloons drift overhead.

                        OLD COLONEL
               (miming to Elvis)
          So don't be bashful, buy a ticket
          Get the habit never kick it

CUT TO the band back in the `Dancing Chickens' tent, who
pluck along.

                        OLD COLONEL
               (miming to Elvis)
          Hear the band there...

CUT TO the dancing chickens.

                        OLD COLONEL
               (shouting at
                chickens)
          Don't just stand there!

With a gesture of his cane to the audience:

                        OLD COLONEL
          I was an impresario of
          astonishment!

Colonel runs up a wiggly carpet to a Carnival.

                        OLD COLONEL
          It's carnival time!!

He hitches a ride on a tremendous Ferris Wheel, swooping
into the sky above the glittering, soft-focused lights of
the midway. Hank Snow's country and western ballad, "Fool
Such As I" softly begins.

                        OLD COLONEL
          My next attraction was in the
          country music business. I
          partnered with one of its biggest
          stars... Hank Snow!

The Colonel looks below, where HANK SNOW, a ten-gallon-
hatted diminutive country singer, and his troubadours
perform on a stage at the Carnival.

                        HANK SNOW
               (sings)
          Pardon me if I'm sentimental when
          we say goodbye...

The country music crowd is delighted.

                         OLD COLONEL
                (miming to Hank Snow)
          Now and then, there's a fool such
             as I...
                (speaking to camera)
          Prophetic words. Hank Snow, such a
          fool.

Looking on from the wings: an identically-dressed 19-year-
old version of Hank, JIMMIE RODGERS SNOW.

                        OLD COLONEL
          And his hapless son, Jimmie
          Rodgers Snow.

An abstract version of Elvis' "That's All Right" begins
to overwhelm the sound of Hank's voice. With the turn of
the Ferris wheel, night becomes day...


EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY (1955)

Carnies pack up the carnival, tawdry in the morning
light. The abstract "That's All Right" transforms into
the original song, emanating in mono from a car radio.

CRANE DOWN to discover Jimmie Rodgers Snow, clutching a
record as he passes a gum-chewing teenager in the cab of
a truck. He flashes the record.

                        JIMMMY
          Hot diggity dog, I got one! It
          will blow their socks off.

We FOLLOW Jimmie to an open-flap chow tent, pitched
amidst the vehicles.


EXT. CARNIVAL - CHOW TENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

45-YEAR-OLD COLONEL puffs his cigar and points with his
cane to a huge map of the South splayed in front of him.

                           COLONEL
             Security, Diskin! Tell the mayors
             of all these towns that we need a
             police escort when Hank arrives in
             town.

Colonel points to a couple more engagements on the map.
Typing out instructions at a nearby desk, is his
impossibly-bland lieutenant TOM DISKIN (35).

                           COLONEL
             In Baton Rouge, we'll stage a
             carny wedding at the top of the
             Ferris wheel. Madam Zeena, pick
             out your next husband. In New
             Orleans we're going to use a
             loudspeaker to announce you, Hank.
                  (to the Little
                   People)
             Meaz-y leaz-ittle freaz-iends,
             you're going to be marching in a
             parade!

                           LITTLE PEOPLE
             Feaz-uck!/Sheaz-it!

                           HANK SNOW (O.S.)
             And I'll be riding an elephant
             too?

Next to Diskin, a nudie-suited Hank Snow strums his
guitar and half-listens to the Colonel. Around them, a
variety of COUNTRY PERFORMERS, as well as the odd
SIDESHOW CARNY, Zeena among them.

                           COLONEL
             A man on an elephant seems
             important.

                             DISKIN
                  (sotto)
             And taller...

                           HANK SNOW
             But we still need a novelty act to
             bring in the young folk.

                           COLONEL
             That's why I've got you a meeting
             with the Duke of Paducah tonight.
             If we can book the funniest mouth
             in the South as our opening act,
             we'll have the best show of the
             season. We'll be feasting on cake.

Suddenly, we hear Elvis' high-pitched voice cutting off
Hank, mid-strum:

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
               (on record)
          That's all right, mama
          That's all right with you
          That's all right, mama
          Any way you do...

All turn to see Jimmie Rodgers defiantly standing next to
the portable record player.

                        HANK SNOW
          Jimmie, turn that racket off!

                        JIMMIE RODGERS SNOW
          But y'all have to hear this! Kids
          all over town are singing it
          everywhere I go.

All present listen intently.

                        HANK SNOW
          I hear Negro rhythms...

                        JIMMIE RODGERS SNOW
          But with a country flavor!

Diskin picks up the record sleeve.

                        DISKIN
          Sun Records, that's Sam Phillips'
          label.

                        COLONEL
          Phillips? That fella who makes
          race records? With all them
          colored singers?

                        JIMMIE RODGERS SNOW
          This fella's on the `Hayride'
          tonight, after me, in the
          newcomers spot.

                        COLONEL
          They ain't puttin' a colored boy
          on the `Hayride'!

                        JIMMIE RODGERS SNOW
          That's the thing! He's white!

The Colonel plucks the cigar from his mouth.

                        COLONEL
          White...

Suddenly, the voice of radio announcer DEWEY PHILLIPS can
be heard wafting in from the cab of the nearby truck.

                         DEWEY PHILLIPS (V.O.)
                (on radio)
          What do you think, Memphis?
          Should we play it for the 27th
          time?

Colonel rests his cane on his shoulder. He's strangely
still, which has the effect of drawing everyone in.

                         OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          It doesn't matter if you do ten
          stupid things... As long as you do
          one smart one.

Colonel intones hypnotically:

                        COLONEL
          How far to Shreveport, Diskin?

                        DISKIN
          Two hours.

                        COLONEL
          Send the Duke our apologies. We're
          going to the Hayride.

As the Colonel and Diskin make a beeline for their
vehicle, Hank catches on:

                        HANK SNOW
          Ahh... A novelty act!


EXT. "HAYRIDE" AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

HIGH WIDE OVER the Shreveport auditorium. We can hear
Jimmie Rodgers Snow singing within:

                        JIMMIE RODGERS SNOW (V.O.)
          How do you think I feel?
          I know your love's not real...


INT. "HAYRIDE" AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

On stage, six diamond-studded, ten-gallon-hatted COWBOYS
croon around a COWGIRL, the object of Jimmie Rodgers
Snow's affection.

At the back of the auditorium, Diskin and Hank look on as
Jimmie leads the delighted audience to clap-and-respond.

                           HANK SNOW
             The apple doesn't fall far from
             the tree! Jimmie has them eating
             out of the palm of his hand!

             Where's Colonel?

                           DISKIN
             Making enquiries.


INT. "HAYRIDE" AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Colonel is behind the backdrop, gathering intel from
Hayride founder, HORACE LOGAN. PERFORMERS come and go.

                           COLONEL
             Have you heard that fella singing
             `All Right Mama,' the new record
             on the Sun Label?

                           HORACE LOGAN
             The pop jocks are playing him,
             country deejays, too. Hell, even
             the colored kids are buying his
             record.

                           COLONEL
             Colored kids? Where might I find
             this act?

                           HORACE LOGAN
             Dressing rooms!

As Horace reenters the stage, he gestures in the
direction of the dressing rooms from which a YOUNG MAN
carrying a guitar appears, heading for the stage door.

The Young Man stops briefly to address the house drummer
D.J FONTANA sitting backstage:

                           YOUNG MAN
             Hey, you the house drummer? Just
             play the back beat and stay out of
             our way!

D.J. nods as the Young Man runs past the STAGE MANAGER.

             Ellis Presley, Blue Moon Boys,
             you're up next.

Colonel follows, watching THROUGH the window as...


EXT. "HAYRIDE" AUDITORIUM - ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The Young Man descends the stairs, passing a PICKUP
TRUCK, in which good ole boys drink beer and flirt with
their gals.

He joins BILL BLACK (28), who cradles a double-bass
beneath the stairs. Bill reads a poster for tonight's
show. At the bottom, "THE BLUE MOON BOYS" and misspelled,
"ELLIS PRESLEY."

                           SCOTTY
             Bill... Go time.

                           BILL
             I know. Ellis Presley... Got a
             nice ring to it.

The Young Man turns, REVEAL:SCOTTY MOORE (24). He shakes
his head. They grab their instruments.

                           SCOTTY
             This thing in tune?

                             BILL
             Close enough.

The beautiful and formidable DIXIE LOCKE (17) joins them,
holding a bottle of PEPSI COLA.

                           SCOTTY
             How is `Ellis's stomach?

                           DIXIE
             Thought I'd grab him a Pepsi, but
             poor thing's still shaking like a
             leaf.

                           BILL
                  (to Scotty)
             What'd they say?

             Newcomer's spot or nothing. We're
             next.

                           DIXIE
             You better come talk to him,
             Scotty. He listens to you.

They all look up towards the sound of Jimmie Rogers
Snow's number, and begin making their way across the
alley, towards two PARENTS huddled around a barely
visible BOY of around 20 years of age.

                           NELL (O.S.)
             Hey Tommy, that's him over there.

The trio passes a skinny country jock, TOMMY, arm around
NELL, his conservatively-dressed girlfriend, in the back
of a pickup.

                           NELL
             That boy from Memphis whose record
             everybody's talking about.

                           TOMMY
                  (incredulous)
             You mean the white kid that's
             singing race music?

Tommy addresses Scotty and Bill.

                           TOMMY
             Hey Scotty Moore! You manage him?
                  (laughing)
             Better tell him to watch out. One
             day somebody's going to beat the
             hell outta him and peel them Negro
             outfits right off his hide.

                           BILL
             Sorry fella, the strip show costs
             extra...

Laughter from Nell sends Tommy seething.

Scotty, Bill and Dixie arrive alongside the family as,
THROUGH the steps, Colonel glimpses the unseen Boy's
constantly-shaking, pink-trousered leg. The boy's shy,
vulnerable voice:

                            BOY (O.S.)
             W-what if I forget the words on
             live radio? I ain't no Jimmie
             Rogers Snow...

He hears the father: VERNON (38), good looks faded by
hard years and disappointment.

                           VERNON
             No one expects you to be Jimmie
             Rogers Snow.

                           BILL
             Its just a bit of clowning around.

                        SCOTTY
          That's how we got this thing
          started in the first place.

BETWEEN THE STEPS, Colonel can now see the mother, GLADYS
(43), intense and nervy, with smoldering Clara Bow eyes.

                        GLADYS
          Scotty and Bill are right, Elvis.
          You're not out there on your own.
          You boys are a band. The Lord gave
          us music to bring people together.
          We're like a family, and family's
          the most important thing of all.

She strokes the Boy's neck as he drinks from a public
water fountain, one marked "WHITE," the other "COLORED."
Gladys indicates that they should all take up each
other's hands.

                        GLADYS
          If the good Lord wants to speak
          through song here tonight, we are
          but vessels of His will. Come on
          now, Booby...

She looks up to the moonlight and intones mysteriously:

                        GLADYS
          Jesse is shining bright tonight.

They all look up. Unsure of what they're doing, the
Colonel follows their gaze to see the moon shining above.

Gladys leads the group in song as one-by-one, they all
join:

                        GLADYS/VERNON/DIXIE/SCOTTY/BILL/
                        BOY
               (sing)
          Some glad morning...
          When this life is over...
          I'll fly away...

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          From my first encounter, this
          insular, strange family was unique
          in its closeness.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          Leaving the boy and his mama alone
          in one of four white houses in a
          Black neighborhood.

... and settles on the fountain marked "COLORED."

                                               MATCH CUT TO:


EXT. SHAKE RAG - AFTERNOON (1947)

An identical "COLORED" sign above a water fountain from
which SMOKY BELL (12) drinks. Next to him, a boy sits,
face buried in a CAPTAIN MARVEL JR. comic book.

The family's singing transforms into a powerful,
spiritual version of "I'll Fly Away" emanating from a
distant PENTECOSTAL TENT.

The comic lowers and we see YOUNG ELVIS PRESLEY (12). His
hair and a crudely-fashioned cardboard lightning bolt
around his neck match the look of his comic book hero.

Young Elvis stands and looks towards the tent.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          It was there he first felt the
          pull between the sacred...

A sharp WHISTLE! Smoky and Young Elvis look to their
SKINNY AFRICAN-AMERICAN FRIEND, waving them towards a
JUKE JOINT that hangs off the road.

                         BIG BOY CRUDUP (V.O.)
          Whoooooooa, black snake crawlin'
             in my room!

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          ... and the profane.

The boys run off towards the juke joint as Young Elvis
stuffs his comic in the back pocket of his overalls.


INT. JUKE JOINT - AFTERNOON

YOUNG ELVIS' POV THROUGH A SPYHOLE: A smoky room. The
nimble fingers of bluesman BIG BOY CRUDUP work the frets
of his weathered guitar. A drunk male CUSTOMER shakes his
leg in an erotic dance with a BORDELLO GIRL.

             That's all right, mama
             That's all right with you...

It's too much for Young Elvis. He pulls away.


EXT. SHAKE RAG - AFTERNOON

HIGH WIDE: The boys give chase as Young Elvis bolts
towards the Pentecostal tent where the spiritual version
of "I'll Fly Away" swells up.


INT. PENTECOSTAL TENT - AFTERNOON

The other boys watch from the open flap as Young Elvis
moves forward, arms aloft, becoming the music.


EXT. "HAYRIDE" AUDITORIUM - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT (1955)

The Colonel glimpses just the Boy's heavy-lidded,
mascaraed eyes.

             I'll fly away, I'll fly away...


INT. PENTECOSTAL TENT - AFTERNOON (1947)

Smoky reaches for Young Elvis. Suddenly, his hand is
stayed by THE PASTOR.

                           PASTOR
             Leave him be; he's with the
             spirit.

As Young Elvis' rapture builds, the CAMERA ASCENDS and
the spiritual is overlaid with:

                            BIG BOY CRUDUP (V.O.)
             Whoooooooa, black snake crawlin'
                in my room!
             That's alright, mama, that's
                alright with you,
             That's alright, mama, any way you
                do.


EXT. "HAYRIDE" AUDITORIUM - ALLEY - NIGHT (1955)

The shy boy duets with Crudup across time.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             I'll fly away, I'll fly away...

SAM PHILLIPS (31), stern, and his no-nonsense secretary
MARION KEISKER (36) appear at the stage door.

                           SAM PHILLIPS
             Better get on up! They've just
             made a big announcement about you
             on the radio.

                           MARION
             Folks are real excited!
                  (sotto)
             Sam, don't look so worried.

As Sam and Marion leave, Colonel uses this opportunity to
follow them back inside the stage door.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Sam Phillips was on a mission to
             save the world by recording black
             music...

Colonel peels off and finds himself looking through the
dock door, where he can see Elvis and the boys ascending
the stairs, the family in tow.


EXT. SUN STUDIOS - DUSK (1954)

A converted shopfront. A neon sign reads: "SUN STUDIOS.
HAVE YOUR VOICE RECORDED -- ONE DOLLAR!" The music from
the Pentecostal church continues underneath.

Marion crosses the road to the studio, carrying coffee
and donuts.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             But it didn't pay, so he tried to
             find a white country-and-western
             star.
                                                     21.


INT. SUN STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - DUSK

We follow Marion as she passes Scotty, Bill and the young
boy in the studio. Scotty is packing up his guitar.

                        SCOTTY
          Sorry kid, I've got to work
          tomorrow.

Marion enters the control room and plonks a coffee down
in front of Sam, despondent at the control desk.

                        SAM
          I don't know what it is you see in
          this boy...

Marion looks up. Although they can't hear, she can see
Elvis larking around in the studio.

                        MARION
          I just think he's... different.

She flicks a switch. An intrigued Sam looks up and rises
to his feet.


INT. SUN STUDIOS - RECORDING ROOM - LATER

Sam, Marion, Scotty and Bill looking at Elvis, a moment
of shocked pause. Sam repositions the microphone in front
of Elvis.

                        SAM PHILLIPS
          How do you know Big Boy Crudup?

Elvis shrugs. He starts to sing "That's Alright, Mama"
over the Pentecostal music. Scotty and Bill join... CUT
TO hours later, the musicians are shaping up the track.


INT. "HAYRIDE" AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (1955)

Elvis and the boys make their way inside. Using
instruments being loaded through the dock door as cover,
Colonel positions himself to get as close as possible.

As Elvis and the boys prepare to take the stage, Colonel
begins to ascend the stairs to the fly tower above.


INT. PENTECOSTAL TENT - AFTERNOON (1947)

The singing reaches a powerful crescendo as Young Elvis
is possessed by the sacred and the profane.

                  (in Sun Studios)
             That's all right, mama...

The distant and dreamlike sound of HORACE LOGAN's voice:

                           HORACE LOGAN (V.O.)
             A young man from Memphis,
             Tennessee... song on the Sun
             label... sky-rocketed right up the
             charts... Elvis Presley! Let's
             give him a nice hand.

Tepid applause takes us to...


INT. "HAYRIDE" AUDITORIUM - STAGE - NIGHT (1955)

CLOSE ON Elvis' shaking legs. TILT UP to DISCOVER a pink
jacket over feminine black lace. A white-hot spotlight
REVEALS his face: heavy with makeup, slumberous,
piercing, blue eyes stare back. His greasy black hair is
an architectural wonder and slashes across his forehead
like a scar.

This is ELVIS PRESLEY at 20.       He is beautiful, defiant,
innocent, strange.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             I cannot overstate how strange he
             looked. I'd seen clowns with less
             makeup.

The Colonel looks out into the auditorium. Bodies
shifting in rickety chairs. Portraits of disdain,
disgust, and confusion. The South as it stands, soon to
be changed forever.

                           HORACE LOGAN (O.S.)
             Elvis, how are you this evening?

                           ELVIS
             Just fine. How're you, sir?

                           HORACE LOGAN
             Are you all geared up with your
             band there to...

                           ELVIS
             I'm all geared up.

                           HORACE LOGAN
             ... to let us hear your songs?

Elvis, flustered, realizes he's cut Horace off.

                           ELVIS
             Uh, well, I'd just like to say how
             happy we are to be down here. It's
             a real honor for us to be- get a
             chance to appear on the Louisiana
             Hayride. We're gonna do a song for
             you we got out on Sun Records...
             you got anything else to say, Sir?

                              HORACE LOGAN
             No, I'm ready!

Elvis looks up to the heavens...

                           ELVIS
             It goes something like this...

At the front of the auditorium, an anxious Vernon stares
at the floor. Beside him, Gladys stares into the eyes of
her son. This does not go unnoticed by the Colonel.

Elvis' chest heaves, mind races, heart pounds.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Ohh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
             Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...

Snickers from the audience.

The Colonel puffs his cigar, eyes narrow. Maybe this
boy's not for the stage.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Come back, baby, I wanna play
                house with you.

In the front row, two of the country kids from the side
alley: pretty-girl NELL and her skinny country jock
boyfriend, TOMMY, chewing gum and smirking--

                           TOMMY
             Get a haircut, fairy!

A flash of anger across Elvis' face. He wails back:

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Weeeeeellll, you may go to
                college, you may go to school,
             You may have a pink Cadillac,
             But don't you be nobody's fool.

CONTINUED: (2)

A cluster of girls in the front start to clap and wriggle
in their chairs excitedly. Colonel climbs the ladder to
the gantry.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Now, baby, come back, baby, come.
          Come back, baby come...

CAMERA CURLS DOWN Elvis' body, revealing what all the
fuss is about.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Come back, baby, I want to play
             house with you!

Elvis' raw nervous energy has caused his habitually shaky
leg to go into overdrive! The front of his pleated,
pegged pants flaps like a tent in a storm.

Fascinated, Colonel begins to cross the gantry for a
better vantage point.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Well, listen to me, baby
          What I'm talking about...

The unpegged pants seem to suggest, and maybe it's true,
that all hell is breaking loose down there.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Come on back to me, little girl
          So we can play some house.

A GIRL in the audience SCREAMS! Elvis and the band
falter, confused by the reaction.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Now baby, come back baby, come
          Come back baby, come...

Marion Keisker shushes the girl who screamed, beside her.

                         ELVIS
               (sings)
          Come back baby
          I wanna play house with you...

But then there's ANOTHER SCREAM, and then ANOTHER, mixed
with an uncertain laughter. The Colonel takes note.

During the guitar solo, Elvis, confused, spins and yells
to Scotty and Bill:

                        ELVIS
          What are they hollerin' at?

                        BILL
          It's the... wiggle.

                          ELVIS
          The what?!

                          BILL
          The wiggle!

                        BILL AND SCOTTY
               (in unison)
          Do more!

Bill slaps out a bass feature, riding Elvis' energy as
the singer throws several thrusts out towards the girls.
They react in waves of squeals and screams.

Colonel descends the stairs side-stage onto the
auditorium floor.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Well, this is one thing, baby
          That I want you to know...

Marion, eyes locked on Elvis, as if suddenly beset by the
devil, finds herself standing and screaming, too.

Colonel, now amongst the audience, clocks this reaction
as he crocodiles across auditorium.

Gladys and Dixie watch, horrified.

                        GLADYS
          Please, Lord, don't let them hurt
          my baby!

                          VERNON
          Hurt him?    Looks like they
          wanna...

He sees Dixie and coughs, embarrassed.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Well, listen to me, baby
          Try to understand...

Colonel eyes every face in the audience as he makes his
way side-stage.

Nell is drawn toward the stage, Tommy follows her.

                        TOMMY
               (to Elvis)
          Pucker up, buttercup.

Elvis, mic in his fist, leans in and enrages Tommy by
sing-whispering a capella to sweet Nell:

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          I'd rather be dead, little
             girl...
               (eyes on Tommy)
          ... than to see you with another
          man.

Time stands still; a dramatic, tense pause. CUT TO Hank
in the wings who, having discovered his son Jimmie, leans
in and utters with revulsion:

                        HANK SNOW
          Oh, my Lord... What in God's sweet
          name am I looking at?

                        JIMMIE
          Pa...

                        HANK
          What were you thinking, Jimmie?

                        JIMMIE
          I guess I thought... I don't know
          what I'm thinking.

Jimmie bites his nail. Hank, in exasperation:

                        HANK
          Where is Colonel?

Jimmie indicates toward the Colonel, watching from the
auditorium.

Elvis flicks his hair and a drop of sweat falls across
Nell's cheek. It's too much -- she implodes. Nell latches
on to Elvis' jacket, then another girl, and another.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Come back, baby, I want to play
             house with you!

Suddenly, Hank appears behind Colonel.

          If we leave now we can still meet
          with the Duke of Paducah...

Colonel ignores him, frozen in disbelief at what he's
witnessing. Traces of "Black Snake Moan" join the score --
the profane.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby...

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          And there it was. I saw it! They
          would come to call it `teenage
          hysteria.' Whatever it was he was
          doing, it touched something within
          her. The urgent, desperate need to
          consume and be consumed.

Marion and Sam look to each other, witnessing a miracle.
Hank witnesses a travesty: his son Jimmie, awestruck.

Elvis sinks momentarily beneath the throng of girls,
tearing at him, scratching his skin.

Nell, possessed, rips off Elvis' jacket. Suddenly, she's
accosted from behind! Gladys grabs the jacket, screaming:

                        GLADYS
          Why are you trying to kill my
          son?!

Gladys recoils in shock, holding Elvis' jacket. The
curtain crashes closed. CLOSE on Colonel as we see the
last glimmer of Elvis, rescued by Scotty, tumbling back
through the blue curtains.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          It was the greatest carnival
          attraction I'd ever seen...


EXT. MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - DAY

The once-crucial cotton port on the snaking Mississippi
River and its triple-spanned bridge.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          He was my destiny.
                                                       28.


EXT. LAUDERDALE COURTS (MEMPHIS) - DAY

A large grass courtyard surrounded by a three-story red-
brick building. Mothers gossip, kids play football and
ride bikes. We catch on the radios all over:

                        RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Here's a new one from Memphis'
          own... Elvis Presley!

The opening lyrics of Elvis' latest recording "Blue Moon"
can be heard, as a Crown Electric truck pulls up.

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          Blue moon,
          You saw me standing alone,
          Without a dream in my heart,
          Without a love of my own...


INT. CROWN ELECTRIC TRUCK - DAY

We catch a glimpse of Elvis' eyes in the rear-view
mirror. CUT TO his hand, taking up his guitar.


EXT. LAUDERDALE COURTS - DAY

As he alights from the truck, we catch Elvis in his two-
tone shoes and grey Crown Electric uniform.

He makes his way down the path, through the Courts, as
girls and boys look on, somewhat confused by Elvis'
sudden notoriety.

                        MEAN BOY
          Hey squirrel, nice sideburns.

                        COOL GIRL
          Hey Elvis.

They stare after Elvis as he crosses the courtyard and
enters the building. We GLIMPSE a humble living room
THROUGH a second-story window.


INT. PRESLEY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A hand holds back the curtain. The girls can clearly be
seen, staring up. The curtain drops. We turn, and it is
Gladys inside the Presley's humble apartment.

             Elvis is home! Billy, go wash up
             then keep setting the table for
             dinner!

Wide-eyed COUSIN BILLY (15) races for the door.

                           BILLY
             Ok, Aunt Gladys! I'm gonna see
             Elvis for a second.

Gladys is clearly anxious as she crosses to the kitchen,
where Dixie is helping prepare dinner.

                           GLADYS
             Vernon, Elvis is home.

Passing Vernon on the phone, we catch a few lines of the
conversation:

                           VERNON
             Yeah, well, Elvis done good but...
             Jimmie Rodgers Snow, he put on a
             real good show.

Gladys takes a bowl of carrots from Dixie.

                           GLADYS
             I'll do that, Dixie, honey. What
             you gonna see at the movies?

Dixie rushes to go freshen up.

                           DIXIE
             Um, I'm not sure!

"Blue Moon" continues to play on a radio on the kitchen
windowsill. It's too much for Gladys and she snaps the
radio off, anxiety palpable in her face. We CUT DOWN to
the radio again but strangely, an a capella version of
"Blue moon" can be heard.

                           ELVIS (V.O.)
                  (sings)
             Oooohhh, oooohhh, eeee-aahhh...

Beyond the radio, through the window, the lights in the
other apartments illuminate, signaling the transition
from day to night.

Neighbors lean out windows, eavesdropping.
                                                      30.


EXT. LAUDERDALE COURTS - STAIRWELL - EVENING

Floating through the window and into the stairwell, we
discover the source of the music. It's Elvis, later that
night, now joined by his girl, Dixie.

Having taken out the trash, he still holds the can in his
hand as he serenades Dixie.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Without a love of my own...

Their lips almost touch. Elvis stares into Dixie's eyes.

                        ELVIS
               (disbelief)
          Hank Snow...

Dixie, a little disappointed, discreetly rolls her eyes.
But Elvis is lost in the thought.

                        ELVIS
          I used to play his records every
          day with Mama and now he's
          personally asked for me to be on
          his tour.... I can't believe it.

The trash can clatters to the ground. Elvis scurries down
to retrieve it. Dixie, a loving roll of the eyes:

                        DIXIE
          So, is that a yes?

                          ELVIS
          Ahh yes?

                        DIXIE
          Coming with me to Goldsmith's on
          Sunday to pick out my prom dress.

                        ELVIS
          Oh, sure, baby...

Elvis, having retrieved the can, is ascending the stairs.

                        DIXIE
          Elvis, after prom, all the couples
          are going to the teen canteen.

She takes the initiative and they kiss...

                          ELVIS
          Wait, Sunday?    Hell, we're in New
          Orleans.

                                                (CONTINUED)

Dixie is crestfallen.

                           ELVIS
             But I'll be back for the dance and
             Mama can help you pick out your
             dress.

                           GLADYS
             Elvis, dinner's ready! Better wash
             up or you'll be late for the
             movies.

                           ELVIS
             Alright, Mama. I'm sorry, baby.
             It's just so much, so quick.

                           DIXIE
             You told your parents?


INT. PRESLEY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Out the window, the GIRLS in the courtyard stare up.

                           GLADYS (O.S.)
             So, without so much as a word to
             your daddy and me...

Gladys snaps the curtain shut.

                           GLADYS
             You quit your job to run around in
             that rickety jalopy, speeding down
             dangerous roads, getting girls all
             hopped up...

Elvis is now resplendent in a top-to-toe pink suit, his
immaculately quaffed bouffant of hair towering over his
scowling forehead. Clearly, things have not gone well.

Vernon is sitting on the couch as Dixie finishes setting
a makeshift dining table for dinner. Billy fills glasses
with iced tea. GRANDMA DODGER (65) sits silently in the
corner. Tension as Gladys serves up the meatloaf.

                           GLADYS
             Soon, you'll be drinking, going
             off to them slut parties--

                           ELVIS
             Mama!

                           GLADYS
             Not keeping the Sabbath...
                  (to everyone)
             Dinner!

Billy, Dixie and Elvis take their seats.

                           ELVIS
             But Mama, it's only four days!

                           GLADYS
             Yeah, four days! And then what?

                           VERNON
             I knew a fella once, got his
             record on the radio, and it was
             all over in a flash.

                           ELVIS
             Mr Phillips says every time I
             perform onstage, it's gonna help
             the record sell and we could make
             some real money! I ain't gonna do
             that driving a truck for Crown
             Electric.

                           VERNON
             Electrician is a good, stable job,
             whereas I don't know a guitar
             player worth a damn.

                           GLADYS
             You listen to your Daddy.

At the exact moment Gladys speaks, the phone rings. Billy
jumps up to answer.

                           BILLY
             It's my mama! She's with Aunt
             Cletus and all the cousins on a
             shared line... She wants to talk
             to you. She heard Elvis on the
             radio.

                           GLADYS
             I can't right now!

                           ELVIS
             Please, Mama! I'm just trying to
             take care of my babies, that's all
             I ever cared about! I ain't ever
             gonna let us be in a place again
             where Daddy gets in trouble with
             the law to put food on the table.

                           GLADYS
             ELVIS!

     A tense silence. Vernon hangs his head, humiliated.

                             GLADYS
               As the good Lord warns us, `Do not
               wear yourself out to get rich, do
               not trust your own Goddamn
               cleverness!'

     Overwhelmed, she storms out.

                             VERNON
               I want to work. I do the best I
               can with my back...

     Dixie gestures towards the hallway and Gladys' bedroom.

                             DIXIE
               Elvis, you've upset your mama.

     INT. PRESLEY APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     A pill being removed from a lacquered medication box.

     Gladys gulps it down as Elvis appears in the doorway
     through the mirror. She's breathing heavily, tears
     streaming down her cheeks, black with mascara.

                             ELVIS
                    (half-jokingly)
               I'm going to buy you one of them
               pink Cadillacs, like you saw back
               when you was working at the
               hospital.

     Gladys breaks a little. She turns to him, embarrassed.

                             GLADYS
               I don't need no pink Cadillac.

                             ELVIS
               Satnin'...

     Elvis takes up Gladys' face in his hands, the tears
     running from her eyes.

                             ELVIS
               I just gotta be making the most of
               this thing while I can. It's like
               Daddy says, this could all be over
               in a flash.

     With this thought, Gladys' mood changes. Still anxious,
     she sits at the dressing table, somewhat in a dream.

She looks up to him.

                           GLADYS
             It's the opposite...

She looks back to the mirror, messing with her hair.

                           GLADYS
             Oh Lord, I look a frightful mess.

Unconsciously takes up a lipstick.

                           GLADYS
             I don't know how to explain it,
             but I saw it in that girl's eyes,
             I saw it.

                           ELVIS
             There's nothing to fear. They're
             just kids getting all hopped up.

Applying lipstick, as if the very act comforts her.

                           GLADYS
             No, it's more than that. It's
             something I don't understand.
             It's something beyond us. But I
             know whatever it is, it's
             something that can come between
             us.

Elvis throws his arms around Gladys from behind, nuzzling
her neck as if she were a giant Teddy bear.

                            ELVIS
             No, no, no... ain't nothing ever
             going to do that. You're my girl,
             my Satnin'. You'll always be my
             best-est girl.

Gladys looks up into his eyes.

                           ELVIS
             I'll call you every night.
             Nothing, but nothing's gonna come
             between us.

Gladys, pleading like a child:

                           GLADYS
             You promise me, Boobie?

He spins the roulette wheel and looks up to see Scotty's
car driving away from Lauderdale Courts. To the iconic
opening of "Mystery Train," the roulette wheel transforms
into a SPINNING CHROME HUBCAP.


MONTAGE - EXT. RURAL ROAD (1955)

It's an AQUATONE BLUE SEDAN emblazoned with "Hank Snow's
Jamboree Attractions Tour!" Diskin at the wheel, Colonel
beside him. In an almost reckless gesture, the sedan
overtakes all the cars in a convoy.

                        COLONEL
          Let's pull over for lunch. What is
          the name of the next place?

          pulling over for lunch up ahead at
          the Tasty Grill. Lunchtime at the

They approach Scotty's Chevy Bel Air, double bass
squeezed inside. Siting the boy's car, Colonel hurriedly

Colonel announces with bonhomie:

                  (over megaphone)
             Can I have your attention, this is

             That's Colonel Tom Parker. He
             knows all the big wheels in the
             business. He made Eddy Arnold a
             movie star.

                           SCOTTY
             I heard he screwed him over.

Bill diffuses the tension.

             I heard there's free pie at the
             Tasty Grill.

             Hello everybody, how's the pie?
             It's cheap at half the price!

Everyone is confused at Colonel's sudden generosity.

                           COLONEL
             Hank! I'm here to check your
             placement in the jukebox.

Colonel arrives at the jukebox, perusing the singles on
offer in the machine:

                           COLONEL
             `Let Me Go, Lover', Hank Snow.
             `Conscience I'm Guilty', Hank
             Snow. `Cryin' Prayin' Waitin'
             Hopin', Hank Snow.

Everyone applauds as Colonel makes his way over to Hank.

                           COLONEL
             All hit records, all RCA! Can't
             beat their distribution.

But Hank is distracted by the sight of Elvis and the boys
on the other side of the cafe. He turns to Colonel.

                           HANK
             Colonel, what is that boy doing on
             our tour?!

                           COLONEL
             I told you all about him? He comes

             And more importantly, about him
             wanting to record one of your
             songs?

             Which one?

Hank, confused and bemused, glances towards Elvis and
considers what Colonel has said.

          Well you warn him plenty, none of
          those lewd gyrations or sudden
          jerky movements.

Colonel, with an ambiguous nod of the head:

                         COLONEL
          I'll speak to the boy
          immediately...

CUT TO Elvis at the table, clearly anxious.

                        ELVIS
          You got a dime for the pay phone?
          I promised to call Dixie and Mama-

But before he can finish his sentence:

                        COLONEL
          Well, if it ain't the new act...

The boys look up and there, towering over them, is the
Colonel. Elvis nervously leaps to his feet, proffering
his hand.

                        ELVIS
          Colonel Parker, sir?     Elvis
          Presley.

                        COLONEL
          Right. You're the fella with that
          funny new record all the kids are
          listening to...

Scotty shifts defensively in the booth.

                        SCOTTY
          It's getting lots of radio play,
          sir.

                          COLONEL
          Who are you?

                        BILL
          Blue Moon Boys.

                        COLONEL
          I did not see that record of yours
          on the jukebox... What label are
          you on?

                        ELVIS
          Sun... Sun Records. Sam Phillips.

                        COLONEL
          Sun... If I were you, young man, I
          would have a talk with my manager.

                          SCOTTY
          That's me.

                        COLONEL
          Hmm... Well, if you are his
          manager I have two words for you:
          one is distribution, and the other
          is distribution... The pie is not
          always free.

Colonel turns to the assembled company.

                        COLONEL
          Alright, remember folks, show time
          is snow time! Hank Snow time. See
          you all in New Orleans.

With this, Colonel is gone. CLOSE ON Bill holding yet
another forkful of pie.

                        BILL
          Free pie, huh? What's that
          supposed to mean?

Colonel taps on the glass and reiterates one last time:

                          COLONEL
          Distribution.

                        ELVIS
          It means our record should be on
          that jukebox.

A glimmer of tension between Elvis and Scotty.

DISSOLVE THROUGH another poster, and another. "Elvis
Presley and the Blue Moon Boys" climbing up the bill.
                                                     40.


INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Elvis busts two strings on his guitar! He stands, blue-
suited, legs apart, motionless...

Teenage fans sizzling like eggs in a pan.

                        ELVIS
               (A cappella)
          I'm gonna hold my baby
          As tight as I can
          Well, tonight she'll know
          I'm a mighty, mighty, man
          I heard the news
          There's good rockin' tonight

Then suddenly, Elvis` body jackknifes! Scotty and Bill
take their cue. The crowd loses it!

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Well, we're gonna rock
          We gonna rock
          Let's rock
          C'mon and rock...

As Elvis apes fornication, Hank, spruced and ready, joins
Colonel and his son Jimmie, now sporting slick pompadour
and sideburns, in the wings just in time to observe...

A PAIR OF PANTIES landing center stage!

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          We're gonna rock
          All our blues away...

To Hank's horror, he sees another PAIR OF PANTIES! And
ANOTHER! Elvis caricatures an orgasmic shimmy.

                        HANK
          Colonel, is that a pair of young
          lady's intimates I see upon the
          stage?

                        COLONEL
          Yes, I believe it is, Hank.

                        HANK
          That best not happen when he sings
          one of my songs.

                        COLONEL
          I'm sure it won't.

An apoplectic Hank storms off.

INT. MOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

Elvis is pacing with the phone, just his pants on. A
TAPPING at the door, a FEW GIRLS GIGGLE outside.

                           ELVIS
                  (whispering)
             Baby, no... It's just part of our
             act. We're savin' ourselves, like
             we said... Love you...

The CLICK of the phone. He falls back onto the bed. Then
there comes a tapping. Softly. Steadily.

                           ELVIS
             Is that a cheeseburger I hear
             knocking at my door, Scotty?

Shirtless, Elvis gets up and opens the door to find a doe-
eyed FEMALE FAN...

She walks past Elvis, into the room. The fan lowers of
the strap of her dress and they fall to the bed together.

We PAN OFF TO a map of Florida.


INT./EXT. CHEVY BEL AIR - DAY

Scotty drives. Elvis looks despondent.

                           SCOTTY
             Aw, come on, EP. Life on the road
             ain't the concern of folks back
             home.

                           BILL
             Why don't you try one of these?

Bill offers up a small, white pill. Elvis considers it...

                           BILLY
             Put the pep back in your step.

Elvis takes it with a swig of coke and we CUT TO:


EXT. DAYTONA CARNIVAL - STAGE - NIGHT

In a shower of panties, Elvis and the boys scuttle off
stage, past Colonel. Jimmie follows Elvis.



                                                 (CONTINUED)
                                                        42.

                            JIMMIE
             Elvis! Elvis! I told them. I told
             them but they didn't wanna believe
             me! You're one of a kind! You're
             something else and I promise, I'll
             put my heart in it. I wanna be
             just like you!

Colonel looks to ashen Hank, trembling with rage.

                           HANK SNOW
             I can no longer in good conscience
             appear onstage with that boy!

                           COLONEL
                  (nonplussed)
             It is a conundrum, a conundrum...

                           HANK SNOW
             After I perform, I shall spend the
             night in prayer.

                           COLONEL
             And I will do what needs to be
             done.


EXT. CARNY CAMP - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Music, laughter. Through the doorway of Hank Snow's
trailer, we see Hank in silent prayer. Emerging from the
trailer, he discovers a backstage petting party and slams
his door shut in disgust.

Scotty and a showgirl make their way through the party,
past pompadoured Jimmie performing on top of a table.
They tumble past Colonel, and into one of the trailers.

Elvis apart, gazing at the Ferris wheel, perturbed.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

                           OLD COLONEL
             I saw him alone, lost. A good
             promoter knows the perfect
             moment...

We FOLLOW Old Colonel's sun-spotted claw as it almost
comes to rest on Elvis' shoulder.

                           SCOTTY (V.O.)
             Elvis!!!
                                                      43.


EXT. CARNY CAMP - NIGHT (1955)

Colonel, unseen, is standing behind Elvis.

Scotty, Bill, Jimmie and a bevy of girls are making their
way towards an enormous, illuminated clown's mouth.

                        BILL
          Elvis, let's go!

Elvis runs after them.


EXT./INT. CARNIVAL - HALL OF MIRRORS - NIGHT

Trailing the rest of the gang, Elvis enters the Hall of
Mirrors under the watchful gaze of ROY LUMOUS, the carny
fixer, lurking in the shadows.

We see Colonel appear in the reflection of a mirror. He
passes Lumous, speaking in a secret carny language:

                        COLONEL
          You ceaz-ould get leaz-ost in heaz-
          ere.

                        LUMOUS
          Yeaz-ou ceaz-ould.

Lumous pulls a lever.


INT. CARNIVAL - HALL OF MIRRORS - NIGHT

The whole party reflected in the mirrors. Lumous'
tattooed hand closes a mirrored door. As if by magic,
Scotty, Bill, and the others disappear before our eyes,
leaving Elvis alone.

                        ELVIS
          Fellas?... Bill?... Quit fooling
          around.

                        COLONEL (O.S.)
          Lost, my boy?...

Elvis spins, surprised by the apparition of the Colonel.

                        ELVIS
          Colonel Parker, sir...

                           COLONEL
          You look lost.

Elvis looks around, but he cannot even guess the way out.

             Well, I was with the guys, then
             they just... Yeah, I guess I am.

                           COLONEL
             The roar of the crowd, life on the
             road. Then calling home,
             pretending to loved ones nothing
             has changed, when everything
             has... Lost.

Elvis tries to laugh it off.

                           ELVIS
             I'm sorry, sir. I meant I don't
             know the way out.

Colonel jovially concurs.

                           COLONEL
             That's precisely what I am saying.
             I saw you, standing apart from the
             others, burdened... Like you
             `don't know the way out of this.'

Colonel pushes a mirror in which Elvis is reflected. It
swings open, revealing a shadowy world behind the midway.

                           COLONEL
             But I do... Allow me to show you.

                           ZEENA (V.O.)
                  (sings)
             Snowman's comin', yes, he's
             comin'...


EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

Elvis follows the Colonel as he skirts the canvas backs
of the tents, greeting roustabouts and freaks warmly as
he goes. Leaning into a group of LITTLE PEOPLE:

                           COLONEL
             Miss Becky, Miss Kathy. A reaz-ed
             one with the reaz-ubes?

The group giggles and nods.

                           COLONEL
                  (to Elvis)
             Snowfall.

Colonel takes in their surroundings with a gesture of his
cane.

CONTINUED:

                           COLONEL
             The language of the carnival. I'm
             one of them. I came into this
             world an orphan, you see, in
             Huntington, West Virginia... But I
             ran away, to join the circus.

                           ZEENA (O.S.)
                  (sings)
             To sprinkle you with snow...

                           COLONEL
             You're either circus, or you're
             not. It's in your nature.

                           ZEENA
                  (sings)
             He'll say `one, two, three,' and
                you'll be...
             In cotton candy land...

They come upon Zeena on the steps of her trailer.

                           COLONEL
                  (to Zeena)
             Al-A-Ga-Zam.

                            ZEENA
             Al-A-Ga-Zam.

                           COLONEL
                  (to Elvis)
             Madam Zeena and I had a mentalist
             act together.
                  (to Madam Zeena)
             Madam Zeena, young Mr. Presley.

                           ZEENA
             Poor, white boy from Mississippi,
             sings and the very rocks and
             stones stand and follow...

                           ELVIS
             And some of the girls, too, ma'am.

                           ZEENA
                  (to Colonel)
             You'll go far with the Colonel.

Elvis looks confused as he and the Colonel move off.

                           COLONEL
             I saw you perform at the
             `Hayride.'

                        ELVIS
          You were there?

                        COLONEL
          Yes, I was. And seeing you there
          made me realize it was our destiny
          to be together.

They stop walking and Colonel looks Elvis in the eye.

                        COLONEL
          I wish to promote you, Mr.
          Presley.

Without missing a beat:

                        ELVIS
          My brother told me you would come
          one day.

Colonel was not expecting this. Colonel brings his cane
slowly to his forehead, and punts on what he saw outside
the "Hayride."

                          COLONEL
          Ahh... Jesse?

They have arrived alongside the GEEK TENT.

                        ELVIS
          Yeah, Jesse. He died when we were
          born.

                          COLONEL
          Twins...

                        ELVIS
          But he's with me, always. Mama
          says when Jesse died, I got the
          strength of two men.

                        COLONEL
          That would explain your tremendous
          energy on stage.

We follow Colonel's gaze to Hank and his band, signing
autographs at a distance. We see Bill, Scotty and Jimmie
searching around the carnival, presumably for Elvis.

                        COLONEL
          The very same energy that upsets
          Mr. Snow so very much.

                        ELVIS
          Sir, the way the kids react? It's
          not my fault...

                        COLONEL
          It is your fault.

Elvis, his attention caught by the performance of the
Geek, is lost in reverie. Colonel leans over to Lumous,
positioned in the ticket booth. He whispers into his ear:

                        COLONEL
          Nobody on the Erie...

With this, Lumous dispatches two BOY CLOWNS towards a
GRIZZLED TATTOOED CARNY at the base of the Ferris Wheel.

Eyes locked on Elvis, Colonel indicates with his cane
towards the Ferris wheel and intones with gravity:

                        COLONEL
          Mr. Presley, are you afraid of
          heights?

The Grizzled Tattooed Carny pulls a lever, halting the
great wheel.

                        ELVIS
          No, sir. I'm not.


EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

Colonel and Elvis swish into the air. Colonel looks out
over the SPARKLING MIDWAY.

                        COLONEL
          Your future, Mr. Presley, blazing
          before you. Recording contracts,
          television, even Hollywood.

                        ELVIS
          You're great, Colonel. The best
          person I could ever hope to work
          with. I ain't never said this to
          anybody before, but I believe I
          can be great, too.

                        COLONEL
          We can be great together. But to
          achieve this, I will need to
          represent you exclusively.

          What about Hank Snow?

                        COLONEL
          Hank wants you off the tour.

CREAK! The wheel stops.

             I will have to leave Hank. We will
             both have to make sacrifices...
             You will need a label with
             national distribution.

The implication sits heavy with Elvis.

                           ELVIS
             RCA?

Colonel nods.

                           COLONEL
             RCA.

                           ELVIS
             Sam Phillips discovered me.

                           COLONEL
             I know we have a way to help Sam
             understand that it would be
             foolish of him to hold you back.


FLASH FORWARD - INT. SUN STUDIOS - NIGHT

We come down onto Sun Studios late at night. Through the
neon-lit shop window, we see Elvis slumped in a chair.
Marion serves him hot cocoa. Sam leans on Marion's desk.
There's a feeling of sadness and finality in the air.

Sam, as if picking up the Colonel's cue:

                           SAM
             RCA does have the distribution...

                           ELVIS
                  (sincere)
             I just need to know that you'll
             still be there with me as friends.

                           SAM
             Hey, don't doubt that. We're not
             going anywhere. Marion and I just
             don't wanna stand in your way,
             that's all.

Marion leans forward, hand on Elvis's shoulder.

                           MARION
             The world needs to hear you sing,
             Elvis.

             It's just business, show business.
             To be truly great requires truly
             great sacrifices. You will need to
             be free of any entanglements...

As the CAMERA TILTS UP TO the stars, the haunting sound
of Elvis' "Tomorrow Night."


FLASH FORWARD - EXT. TEEN CANTEEN - NIGHT

We TILT DOWN to discover a row of parked cars. We reveal
Elvis in his pink tux. Dixie, in her prom dress, crying.

                  (burdened)
             Colonel says that with all the

             well, he might have to put it out
             there that...

He's nervous to say this next thing, guilty...

                           ELVIS

Elvis stares into her eyes.

             I love you, Dixie Locke. I always
             will...

Elvis still in a reverie, imagining Dixie's feelings.

FLASH FORWARD - INT. SUN STUDIOS - DAY

As Marion ushers Gladys and Vernon towards a table of
paperwork, Gladys whispers to Vernon.

                           GLADYS
             Sam Phillips is a good man, who we
             can trust; we don't know this
             Colonel from a nail in the wall...

                           COLONEL
             I am of the firm belief that
             family is the most important thing
             in the world. With that in mind,
             I've taken the liberty of making
             these contracts out in the name of
             `Elvis Presley Enterprises,' a
             family business.

Colonel gestures in the air.

                           COLONEL
             And I was thinking... `Vernon
             Presley: Business Manager!'

The room applauds. Vernon is dumbfounded by the status
bestowed upon him.

                           ELVIS
             What do you think, Daddy?

                           VERNON
             I like it very much, son.

Colonel notices Cousin Billy, excitedly looking on.

                           COLONEL
             You know Billy, Elvis is going to
             need a lot of help on the tour...

                           ELVIS
             Hell, you could be my road manager
             one day, Billy!

Billy beams, and all laugh. Colonel solemnly signs and
offers the pen to Gladys.

             unique gift. It's as if he has the
             strength of two men inside of him.

Elvis clocks this unspoken moment of collusion between
them. Gladys stares, pen suspended above the contract.

EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

Elvis looks away from the Colonel, out over the midway.

                           ELVIS

To a "DNA" track, we APPROACH a noir-lit Elvis caged in
an abstract thicket of microphones.

             Morbid. Odd. We can't release

             It's down at the end of lonely
             street at heartbreak hotel...

We DISSOLVE THROUGH HEADLINES: "First No. 1!" "The King
of Western Bop!" "First Gold Record! "

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             It was a hit. After hit, after
             hit.


EXT. GRACELAND - GATES - DAY (1956)

CLOSE ON an Elvis number plate.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Together, we made a blizzard.

We see a candy-pink Cadillac swing through a wooden gate,
a sunglass-ed Dodger hanging out a window. They pass
grazing cattle and a sign: "SOLD! GRACELAND FARM."


MONTAGE - INT./EXT. GRACELAND - DAY

In front of a white-columned 1930s Colonial mansion,
Elvis bounds from the car, beaming as he holds out the
keys to Gladys. Gladys crosses the threshold in tears.
Vernon hangs back in awe.

Before our eyes, the interior of Graceland transforms
into all that money can buy!

As televisions and phones are being unpacked, we see
Gladys, now in a different costume, standing with her
newly introduced MAID.

A little flummoxed, Gladys follows the maid as she
carries a brand new MIXER to the kitchen. We WHIP PAN to
Gladys, now in a different costume on a different day,
chasing chickens past the maid who is laying out fine
china on the dining table.

CONTINUED:

Gladys herds the chickens into the front yard and through
a dozen Cadillacs, finally mustering them towards Dodger.

A football suddenly smashes amidst the chickens.
Irritated, Dodger hurls the football back to the horse
yards where Elvis catches it and is crash-tackled by the
West cousins as Jerry looks on. A noisy GO-CART driven by
Billy cuts through the fray and through the Cadillacs,
almost colliding with Gladys and the chickens.

WIDE SHOT: a portrait of the mayhem. CRANE DOWN through
the trees to discover the rickety wooden fence is now
replaced by the famous music gates, fans gathered around,
opening as delivery trucks make their way through.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             I booked him on television, I got
             him that screen test, and a seven-

             But most importantly...

We follow the boxes as they're unloaded from the truck
outside and carried into Graceland by two workmen.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             I created something never before
             seen. One day it would become

             Something for everyone to show
             their love... Oh look, Dodger,
             what's that behind your ear?

Colonel leans in and does a magic trick, pulling the pin
from behind Dodger's ear.

                             GLADYS (O.S.)
             I hate Elvis?

Colonel's face darkens. Gladys is holding one of the
other `I Hate Elvis' pins.

                           COLONEL
             Yes, I hate Elvis. To my way of
             thinking, `I Love Elvis' is easy
             to sell, but those that hate your
             son will do so whether we profit
             or not.

He takes the pin from Gladys and turns to Elvis.

                           COLONEL
             After all, what is hate worth if
             it's free?

Elvis takes the pin and examines it while considering the
Colonel's point. After a heavy moment, Elvis cracks a
smile. He stands and pins it on his lapel.

                           ELVIS
             The snowman strikes again...

They all laugh. CUT AWAY to Gladys, a look of concern.

             But what was it people hated
             exactly?

We ZOOM down on the `I Hate Elvis' pin.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Even in high school, Elvis was
             listening to Black radio, going to
             their churches, and hanging out on
             Beale Street...
                                                        56.

The `hate' badge blossoms into a flower, pinned to the

the bustling crowd as we see portraits of life on Beale.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          Elvis wasn't just into the music.
          It was the look...

             That was Mr. B.B. King.

                           LANSKY
             Indeed it was. And you would be...
             eyeball buying?

Elvis' eyes turn back to a particularly suave pink suit
displayed prominently in the window.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             ... and pretty soon, they sought
             him out, too.

INT./EXT. LANSKY BROS. - DAY (1956)

The same pink suit in Lansky's window and now beside it,
a photo of Elvis wearing the suit on stage.

                           LANSKY
             Son, ever since you first came in
             here, you've been saying you're
             gonna buy me out but I told you...

We push past the window to where Elvis is now together
with B.B. and Lansky, buying up the store. Clerks' arms
are piled with Elvis' purchases: brightly-striped shirts
and jackets of every description.

                           LANSKY
             Buy from me, don't buy me out!

                           ELVIS
             Mr. Lansky, it's Milton Berle. The
             whole of America will be watching!

                           LANSKY
             I don't watch television.

                           B.B. KING
             So what's it gonna be? How are you
             gonna blow their wigs off?

                           ELVIS
             Well the network wants me to do a
             ballad... but I was thinking of
             cuttin' it up with `Hound Dog'.

B.B. contemplating the enormity of it all:

                           B.B. KING
             Elvis Presley. `Hound Dog'. Uncle
             Miltie. Strange things happening
             every day...

As Elvis riffs, starting to give B.B. King a sneak peek
of his performance, we MATCH CUT TO:


INT. NBC STUDIOS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

ON Elvis, cutting the music into half time.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             You ain't nothin' but a hound dog!
             Cryin' all the time!

Colonel watches from the studio floor, Diskin beside him.

                           COLONEL
             Behold. Tomorrow all of America is
             going to be talking about Elvis
             Presley.

Elvis launches onto his toes, thrusts his pelvis out
towards America, and BOOM!

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Suddenly, he became a gateway to
             Black culture, beamed out into
             every living room in America...


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

Elvis' body and sound ripples out through 50 MILLION TVs!

As one TV FILLS THE SCREEN, we find ourselves in...


INT. SENATOR EASTLAND'S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

An ideal American family: MOTHER, THREE DAUGHTERS, and a
SON sit around the television, watching Uncle Miltie.

Behind them, we glimpse the FATHER in his study, reading
the paper, surrounded by SUITED COLLEAGUES.


INT. NBC STUDIOS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

Elvis' performance sends a ripple of laughter out through
the predominantly female audience.

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:


INT. GRACELAND - DAY

-- another screen, as we find ourselves with Gladys,
Vernon, Dixie, and the extended Presley family, all
crowded around the television set.

                           GLADYS
             Even as a little one, he made me
             laugh so! He's so funny!


INT. SENATOR EASTLAND'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

A newspaper headline: "Segregation Unconstitutional:
Supreme Court Strikes Down Mississippi Bus Law."

The paper lowers to reveal the all-American father,
SENATOR "BIG JIM" EASTLAND, chomping a cigar.

                           EASTLAND COLLEAGUE (O.S.)
             And for the next leg of your
             Racial Integrity tour, we've
             booked the Overton Park Shell in
             Memphis...

But Eastland doesn't hear him, distracted by the sound of
his children's laughter. He rises, moving towards the
television.

                           SENATOR EASTLAND
             What are they laughing about?
                                                      60.


INT. NBC STUDIOS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

Elvis pushes his gyration further and further. The whole
experience has taken on a more raw and intense tone.


INT. SENATOR EASTLAND'S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

The blue light of the television dances across Eastland's
disturbed face, boiling with rage.

                        SENATOR EASTLAND
          Who the hell is that?

                        MRS. EASTLAND
               (unsettled)
          It's that boy from Memphis.

Eastland glances to his besotted daughters, barely able
to conceal their desire.

                        EASTLAND'S DAUGHTER
          Elvis Presley...

Eastland does a double-take, catching the same look on
the face of his son. A rising, volcanic revulsion as
Elvis comes back to real time:

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          And you ain't no friend of mine!


INT. GRACELAND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Presley family whoops and hollers as Berle kids
around with Elvis, pretending to gyrate.


INT. SENATOR EASTLAND'S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

Eastland strides aggressively toward the television, face
contorted in a white rage, body shaking with hate.

                        SENATOR EASTLAND
          A white boy from Memphis... moving
          like a goddamn--?!

The screen snaps black! A dark chord. The fun is over.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

Eastland, isolated. He speaks from behind a desk:

CONTINUED:

                           SENATOR EASTLAND
             The obscenity and vulgarity of
             this rock and roll music is
             obviously a means by which the
             white man and his children can be
             driven to the level of the Negro!

We PULL BACK and Eastland is on a 1950s TV.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             It was putting it on the
             television that caused the
             problem... It became politics.
             And politics ain't good for
             business.

Another TV, and another, until the SCREEN is FILLED with
1950s TVs on which outraged critics decry:

                           VARIOUS CRITICS (V.O.)
             Vulgarity!/Mongrel music!/Bebop is
             Communism!/Ask Your Preacher about
             Jungle Music!

                           POLITICIAN (V.O.)
             The subversives who own, control,
             and dominate the entertainment
             industry...

We PUSH THROUGH a headline: "Public Outcry: Steve Allen
under pressure to cancel Elvis."


EXT. HUDSON THEATER (NEW YORK) - DAY (1956)

TRACKING DOWN the neon-lit "NBC TELEVISION" sign that
precedes the Steve Allen "Tonight Show."

                           POLITICIAN (V.O.)
             ... are determined to spread
             Africanized culture, influencing
             your children to accept Negroes!

CAMERA GLIDES OVER the massive crowds of reporters,
rubber-necking pedestrians, and Black and white teens
spilling over the sidewalk outside.

As we start to hear the sweet sound of Elvis' voice
singing a gospel song to a simple piano accompaniment, we
GO THROUGH the stage door window...

                           ELVIS (V.O.)
                  (vocal)
             I ask the Lord for everything,
             I count my blessings each day...
                                                        62.


INT. HUDSON THEATER - REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

We DISCOVER Colonel's cane and feet walking across the
newspaper-strewn floor. A copy of The Memphis Press-
Scimitar is dropped on the ground.

Above a photo of Elvis at the fairgrounds on "colored
night," a headline reads: "Rock `n' Roll Phenomenon
Cracks Memphis Segregation Laws." The CAMERA TILTS UP...

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          We had to change course fast.

... and we FIND Elvis at a piano in the corner.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          And he'll come to you,
          If you'll ask him to.
          He's only a prayer away.
          Is your heart filled with pain?
          Shall I come back again?
          Tell me dear, are you lonesome
          tonight?

Elvis stops, sensing the Colonel's presence. He looks
down at one of the headlines at his feet: "Elvis the
Pelvis belongs in the Jungle!"

                        ELVIS
               (shaking his head)
          Elvis the Pelvis... That's one of
          the most childish expressions I
          ever heard coming from an adult.

Elvis looks up to see Scotty and Bill at the other end of
the room, reading the papers. Everyone is on eggshells.

                        ELVIS
          Mr. Allen gonna cancel me from the
          show?

                            COLONEL
                 (somber)
          Yes.

Elvis looks up, ashen. Scotty and Bill are on their feet.
They expected as much, but it still stings.

                        COLONEL
          He's replacing you with America's
          greatest singer...

A rack of tail suits is wheeled in, followed by a tailor.

             Someone greater!

Elvis stands to examine the suits.

                           COLONEL
             The new Elvis Presley! I snowed
             him! I snowed him. You wear these
             here tails, it's a custom job;
             sing the hound dog; it will be a
             light-hearted, sophisticated
             family show.

                           ELVIS
             I can't move in one of these.

                           COLONEL
             That's the whole point.

Colonel stops, sudden gravitas:

                           COLONEL (CONT'D)
             Allen's only agreed as long as
             there's no wiggling of the hips.

                           ELVIS
             I can't figure it out. What am I
             doing wrong? My own mother
             approves of what I'm doing.

Colonel points at all the papers on the ground.

                           COLONEL (CONT'D)
             Have you seen the papers?

                           ELVIS
             Yeah, the papers say I shot my
             mother and smoke marijuana...

                           COLONEL
             The papers say your movement has
             the style of a colored man.

Colonel picks up the copy of The Memphis Press-Scimitar,
featuring Elvis breaking segregation laws.

                           COLONEL (CONT'D)
             And that you are breaking
             segregation laws.

Colonel leans in.

                        COLONEL (CONT'D)
          It's a simple plan. A good plan.
          You do the Allen show, family
          style. Tomorrow, we'll return to
          Memphis and snow them with a 4th
          of July children's charity
          concert. Then we can put this
          unfortunate misstep behind us.

Colonel holds the tails up to Elvis. He looks at them.

                        COLONEL (CONT'D)
          Now, do we want to go into
          politics or stay in show business?

Elvis has no comeback.

                        SCOTTY
          Hey Colonel, what do the light-
          hearted, sophisticated, Blue Moon
          Boys wear?

                        COLONEL
               (dismissive)
          We didn't discuss it.

As Colonel snaps the gap in the clothes rack shut, the
CAMERA rushes through black and discovers...


INT. STEVE ALLEN STUDIOS - STAGE - NIGHT

Steve Allen, introducing Elvis. Elvis turns to camera,
now dressed in the tails. His face is a mask of horror.
Staring back at him: a live BASSET HOUND in a top hat.
The Blue Moon Boys look on.

An abstract nightmare of images: the dog barking; a flat
audience not reacting; Steve Allen laughing.

A keening scream of humiliation.

CUT TO: Elvis rushing from the stage, pushing past Scotty
and Bill who follow.


INT. STEVE ALLEN STUDIOS - REHEARSAL ROOM - LATER

Elvis bursts into the room tearing off the tails--

                        ELVIS
          God damn it... damn it!

He hurls the tails on the ground, turning to Scotty and
Bill who are right behind him.

             He could have given me some
             warning. I know how to do a skit.
             I could have made it funny.

                           SCOTTY
             It weren't meant to be funny. It
             were meant to make fun of us and
             it did. It were the most stupid,
             embarrassing, humiliating thing I
             ever did.

                           ELVIS
             What the hell do you want me to do
             about it?

Scotty, totally out of character, yells:

                           SCOTTY
             We're musicians!

All three of them are silenced by the thought.

                           SCOTTY
             Well, we used to be. We used to be
             a band, now we're... I don't know
             what we are.

He looks at Elvis and turns to go.

                           SCOTTY
             I'll... see you back in Memphis.

Only Bill now, he nods his head with deep affirmation.

                           BILL
             You looked good in them tails...

He turns and leaves.


EXT. GRACELAND - FRONT GATES - DAY

Elvis' purple El Dorado arrives at the front gates,
thronged as usual with fans.

Vernon drives, Elvis beside him. Elvis is visibly shaken
as he sees that some of the fans hold signs that read:
"No New Elvis," "We Want Old Elvis," etc...

                           VERNON
             Not signing today, son?

Elvis just stares ahead, despondent.

INT. GRACELAND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The family are mid-argument. The news plays on the
television. Vernon changes the channel.

                        VERNON
          These bus boycotts aren't doing
          nothing for nobody far as I can

               (to Elvis)
          I like what you done with the TV
          thing. I like the bit with the
          dog... I like dogs

THROUGH the window, Billy can be seen playing in Elvis'
eccentric German MESSERSCHMITT CAR.

Dodger sits at the dining room table while Gladys
prepares for dinner. Strewn around the house are teddy
bears, fan mail, and new appliances.

                        GLADYS
          Those New York people were using
          you to poke fun at the whole
          South! Getting a laugh outta
          putting the hillbilly in a tail
          coat and singin' to a dog.

                        ELVIS
          God damn it, Mama, it were either
          that or get canceled! Then that's
          it for television. And Colonel
          says we running outta states I'm
          welcome in, and they don't pay
          unless I can perform. Colonel says
          I play the charity concert
          tomorrow night...

Elvis can't bring himself to say "the new Elvis."

                        ELVIS
          ... family style. Then everybody
          calms down and we can get back on
          track.

                        VERNON
          Someone's gotta think about
          keeping a roof over our heads.

             We was doin' just fine, before
             that man came along.

                           ELVIS
                  (defensive)
             Colonel's got us all this.

                           GLADYS
             I don't want all this! You're
             unhappy...

                           ELVIS
                  (tries to deny it)
             I'm not...

                           GLADYS
             You're losing yourself, baby. The
             way you sing and move, it's God-
             given, so there can't be nothin'
             wrong with it. Satnin' knows...

Suddenly, Billy and a tangle of muddy cousins burst in!

                           BILLY
             Hey, E.P., can we close down the
             movie house and see Godzilla
             tonight!?

                           ELVIS
             No! And don't tramp mud in the
             house, Billy!
                  (back to Gladys)
             You ain't never happy! No matter
             what I do, no matter how much I
             give you, it ain't never enough!

He's looking at his family. They love him dearly, but
they can't relate to the life he leads.

                           ELVIS
                  (making for the door)
             And I wish you wouldn't drink so
             much! It ain't good for ya!

                           GLADYS
             Baby! Come back!

But he's gone.


EXT. GRACELAND - DUSK

Elvis peels out in his PURPLE CADILLAC EL DORADO.
                                                        68.


EXT. GATES OF GRACELAND - CONTINUOUS ACTION

He negotiates the car through fans gathered at the gates.

From a spot across the street, a BLACK SEDAN follows.


INT./EXT. EL DORADO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Elvis punches on the radio. "Hound Dog" plays. He flips
through the stations: another Elvis track, and another.
He changes the station again, landing on "Rip It Up."

The song invades the soundtrack and the El Dorado tears
off as we TILT UP TO downtown Memphis.


EXT. BEALE STREET - NIGHT

HIGH, OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN THROUGH the second-story
window, above which hangs the neon sign of "Club Handy."

CRANE DOWN to see a sharply-dressed B.B. King leaning on
the sill. He sees the El Dorado squeal to a halt across
the road.

RACK DOWN THE LINE. Break, grind, switch off, key out,
slam door. Elvis is out, collar up.

                          B.B. KING
          E.P.!

Elvis spies the long line outside the door and a couple
patrons pointing in recognition. B.B. mimes `I got you.'

CAMERA JAMS UP TO the other window and THROUGH INTO...


INT. CLUB HANDY - NIGHT

Elvis and B.B. are now outside the upstairs doors to the
club. They're greeted by the owner, SUNBEAM MITCHELL.

                        B.B. KING
          Listen man, if you're sad and you
          wanna be sad, you're at the right
          place. If you're happy and you
          wanna be happy, guess what? You're
          at the right place. What you need
          is the tonic that ails you.

                        LITTLE RICHARD (O.S.)
          Let it all hang out!

The many patrons inside the club repeat the call.

                                                (CONTINUED)
                                                        69.

                           B.B. KING
             Listen to the man. Let it all hang
             out. Come on, let it all hang out.

Memphis photographer ERNEST WITHERS shakes hands with
B.B. and Elvis. Then as the doors swing open, B.B. King
leads Elvis through the ecstatic throng. As usual, Elvis
the only white face in the room.

A flash of lightning on stage in the form of a rouged and
lipsticked face beneath a towering bouffant: 19-year-old
wild-child LITTLE RICHARD.

                           LITTLE RICHARD
                  (sings)
             A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-wop-bam-
                boom!
             Tutti Frutti, good booty!
             Tutti Frutti, good booty!

To the delight of the crowd, Little Richard bangs the
piano like a percussive instrument.

                           LITTLE RICHARD
                  (sings)
             I got a girl named Sue
             She knows just what to do
             I got a girl named Sue
             She knows just what to do

Elvis follows B.B. snaking through the crowd, as Sunbeam
Mitchell guides them across the room.

                           ELVIS
             Man, he is cuttin' it!

                           B.B. KING
             Sister Rosetta found this kid in
             the backwaters of Georgia.

                           ELVIS
             I should get the Colonel to book
             him on `Steve Allen'... they gonna
             love his moves.

On top of the piano now, Little Richard pulls open his
shirt to the delight of the crowd.

                           LITTLE RICHARD
                  (vocal)
             A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-wop-bam-
                boom!

A constant flutter of girls surround B.B. and Elvis as
they slide into their corner table.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

               (speaks)
          Man, he sings the hell outta that
          song. I'd love to record that.

B.B. eases back, cigarette dangling from his fingers.

                        B.B. KING
          If you do, you'll make a whole lot
          more money than that kid could
          ever dream of...

Little Richard's voice cuts through raucous applause:

                        LITTLE RICHARD
          She's a sister of the Lord and a
          sister to all of us, without whom
          we would not even be here...
          Sister Rosetta Tharpe!

Elvis perks up as SISTER ROSETTA THARPE takes the stage,
electric guitar slung over her shoulder.

                        SISTER ROSETTA THARPE
               (sings)
          Up above my head, I hear music in
          the air...

The energy irresistible, Elvis and B.B. get up from their
table and join the audience.

A guitar solo takes us outside, where we can see the
parked car that tailed Elvis.

                        B.B. KING
          Friends of yours?


EXT. BEALE STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

From the car, two SHADOWY FIGURES look up at the window:
the silhouette of Elvis dancing with a young girl.

The lights of Beale Street go off, and as the noise and
energy of Club Handy dissipates, we hear the strains of
the Gospel classic "Working On A Building."


INT. CLUB HANDY - LATER

Through the window, we can see the crowd has gone,. The
club's staff puts chairs on tables.

CONTINUED:

Elvis, B.B., Sister Rosetta, Little Richard and the house
band hang around for a final drink and a late-night
Gospel session.

As a song concludes, Elvis and B.B. wander to the bar.

                           B.B. KING
             That's a nice ride you rolled up
             in tonight.

                           ELVIS
             It's no giant B.B. King bus!

Beside the bar, B.B. deftly hoists himself through an
open window onto the fire escape, Elvis follows.

                           B.B. KING
             Big Red! Yeah, I can go where I
             want, play where I want, and if
             they don't like it, I can go
             someplace else. It's about
             control, man. It's like having my
             own label: if you don't do the
             business, the business will do
             you.

                           ELVIS
                  (brushing it off)
             I leave all that to the Colonel.

                           B.B. KING
             So it's his idea, this "New
             Elvis"?

Elvis nods as B.B. lights a cigarette.

                           B.B. KING
             I don't get it, man. Cats buy your
             records because they like what you
             do, not `cause you're dressed up
             like some... butler! You really
             think those kids want to see
             "Elvis the butler" at this
             Russwood Park gig tomorrow?

                           ELVIS
             I ain't wearing no tails. I just
             got to back off the moves, is all.
             Colonel says if I don't, they
             gonna put me in jail.

B.B. laughs at the prospect.

                           B.B. KING
             C'mon man, they're not gonna put
             you in jail.

                        B.B. KING (CONT'D)
          They might put me in jail for
          walking down the street, but you a
          famous white boy! Too many people
          are making too much money outta
          you to put you in jail.

The truth of this hangs heavy with Elvis as, from inside,
Sister Rosetta develops the jam into one of her songs.

                        SISTER ROSETTA THARPE
               (sings)
          Every day... yes! There are
          strange things happening every
          day!

                          ELVIS
          You think so?

                        B.B. KING
          I know so. Colonel's too smart.
          There's got to be another reason.

Just then, Ernest Withers calls out through the window:

                        ERNEST WITHERS
          Hey, Elvis, B.B.! Give us a smile!

The FLASH BULB BURNS the SCREEN while the unanswered
question is memorialized in Elvis' eyes. "Strange Things"
takes on a sinister undertone...


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

We PULL OUT from the photo of B.B. and Elvis, arm-in-arm,

Colonel looks up, ashen. Caught.

             You were never a Colonel, never a

EXT. RUSSWOOD PARK BASEBALL STADIUM - NIGHT       (1956)

As the VICE SQUAD installs movie cameras, POLICE erect a
barrier separating BLACK and WHITE TEENS. On the open
stage on the field, a 4th of July kick line number...

As "Strange Things" builds menacingly, CRANE HIGH...

A WHITE PATROL CAR makes its way through the crush of
people and traffic outside.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

Eastland appears, orating before a Confederate flag.

                           SENATOR EASTLAND
             The South will retain segregation.
             The governor of a sovereign State

             away at the Memphis bandshell.


INT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT (1956)

A PATROLMAN and a POLICE CHIEF in the front. Elvis in the

socks. Colonel, beaming, leans on his cane beside him.

Elvis, still not looking at him:

                           ELVIS
             I made no decision. I'll feel it.

                           COLONEL
             Pay no mind to the big cameras.
             That's just our friends in the
             Vice Squad. They don't mean
             nothin.
                  (to the Police Chief)
             Ain't that right, Chief?

The Police Chief, a stone cold affirmation:

             As long as you don't so much as
             wiggle a finger.

Colonel laughs as they alight.

             All you gotta do is stand there,
             sing the nice song, smile the nice

       Arriving at the microphone, he holds his hand up in the
       air to quiet the audience. The crowd settles, immense
       tension in the air.

       Colonel and the police, Gladys, Vernon, Dodger, and
       Billy, all look on anxiously from the roped-off area.

                  There's been a lot of talk about
                  the New Elvis.

       The crowd boos.

                                ELVIS
                  And you know, that other guy.

       Elvis can see the cameras of the Vice Squad and with a
       smirk, he raises his pinky finger into the air.

       The perplexed and bewildered faces of THE CONVALESCENT
       CHILDREN'S HOME CHARITY COMMITTEE, sitting side-by-side
       with THE MAYOR, THE MINISTER, and the Police Chief as

       A squall of ear-shattering screams and laughter as he
       mocks the surveillance. CUT TO the stony faces of the
       Mayor and dignitaries, appalled.

       After a moment, Elvis looks up and can just hear Senator
       Eastland's rally on the wind:

                                EASTLAND (O.S.)
                  ... civil and other, to maintain
                  public order, and prevent crime
                  and riots...



                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                        76.

                            ELVIS
             There's a lot of people saying a
             lot of things.

Elvis looks to the Colonel. They hold each other's gaze
for what seems like an eternity.

                           ELVIS
             You gotta listen to the people you
             love.

He looks to Gladys and Vernon.

                           ELVIS
             But in the end you gotta listen to
             yourself.

Elvis places his guitar down.

                           ELVIS
             You know, those people in New York
             are not gonna change me none.

He glances to Scotty and Bill and whispers to their
incredible excitement and delight:

                           ELVIS
             Trouble.

Then, in a building crescendo, he virtually screams.

                           ELVIS
                  (yells)
             I'm gonna show you what the real
             Elvis is like tonight!

The band kicks in like a Molotov cocktail.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             If you're looking for trouble
             You came to the right place!
             If you're looking for trouble
             Just look right in my face!
             I was born standing up
             And talking back...

14,000 white and Black teenagers thunder the chorus!

                           ELVIS/CROWD
                  (sing)
             My daddy was a green-eyed mountain
                jack!
             Because I'm evil, my middle name
                is misery!

CONTINUED: (2)

The place goes bananas! The rope fence is CRUSHED under
the jitterbugging, jiving, writhing youth. The line
between Black and white bleeds together in the mayhem.

                        ELVIS/CROWD
               (sing)
          I'm evil, evil, evil, as can be!!!

He dances and grinds, exploding with sexuality.

                        ELVIS/CROWD
               (sing)
          So don't mess around, don't mess
             around,
          Don't mess around with me!

He staggers around the stage as if drunk. Falling to the
ground, grinding on the mic stand as if making love.

Amidst the hysterical youth, a WHITE GIRL deliriously
dances with a HIP YOUNG FAN.

                        ELVIS/CROWD
               (sing)
          I'm evil, evil, evil as can be!


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

                        SENATOR EASTLAND
          He can use these forces to prevent
          the racial integration of schools
          if this is necessary under the
          police power of the States to
          prevent disorder and riots. In
          fact it is his duty to preserve
          order and prevent turmoil and
          strife within the state.

Eastland stops and slowly turns toward the overwhelming
din of the hysterical fans.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          That night, the noise was so great
          it could be heard at Eastland's
          rally.

Eastland, as he realizes that the hordes are coming.


EXT. RUSSWOOD PARK STADIUM - FIELD - NIGHT (1956)

Police try to press the crowd back. Colonel turns to the
family. He can see things are getting out of hand.

                           COLONEL
             Now, I know that Elvis would want
             me to look after your safety and I
             think now would be a very good
             time to get back into the car.

                           VERNON
             What? Now?

Colonel makes his way over to Diskin. Elvis becomes
wildly provocative with RCA's mascot, Nipper the dog.

                           COLONEL
             Our friends at RCA are not gonna
             be too happy when they hear about
             that.

The sergeant's men begin to move the family towards their
waiting vehicle. As Colonel repositions himself beneath
the stage, it is clear to him that things have gotten
completely out of control. He barks to the sergeant:

                           COLONEL
             Get him off the stage!
                  (to Diskin)
             Protect the merchandise!

                           ELVIS/CROWD
                  (sing)
             SO DON'T MESS AROUND, DON'T MESS
                AROUND, MESS AROUND...

But before Elvis can finish, THE CROWD RUSHES THE STAGE
and the sergeant's men surround him. He drops the
microphone. The boys abandon their instruments. The
police throw a wall around Elvis, dragging him away, as
Scotty and Bill are sucked back into the melée.


INT./EXT. PATROL CAR/RUSSWOOD PARK - NIGHT

The police sergeant and his men try to hustle Gladys into
the car. She stops, seeing Elvis is not yet safe.

                           GLADYS
             Elvis! Elvis! Get in the car!

Elvis gets thrown into a police car as Gladys is dragged
by Vernon into the family car. THROUGH the rear window,
Elvis glimpses their car and the vehicle with Scotty and
Bill departing in different directions.

At the center of it all, the Colonel stands with the
stage collapsing behind him.

Elvis drops his head back, looking up as 4th of July
fireworks explode all around him. He closes his eyes.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

                           OLD COLONEL
             He didn't listen...

Colonel UPTURNS the table!!

                           OLD COLONEL
             HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME!!

A dramatic, operatic version of `Jailhouse Rock' builds
as we hear the BING-BING-BING of the slot machines,
infused with Colonel's heavy breathing.

                           OLD COLONEL
             The charismatic child had no idea
             of the terrible price we would
             both pay for his glorious tantrum.
             I had to find a way out, a way to
             save him.


EXT. GRACELAND - DAY (1958)

Drizzle smears the lonely Cadillacs in the driveway.


INT. GRACELAND - LIVING ROOM    - DAY

It's gloomy and cold. Gladys sits with Vernon around the
fire, Colonel nearby. Elvis on the lounge, singing.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Well, I went to the bayou just
             last night
             There was no moon, but the stars
             were bright..

Gladys holds a drink, shaking. Vernon stares blankly
ahead. Elvis in shock.

                           GLADYS
             No, there's no way I'm letting my
             baby go to Germany for two years!

                           VERNON
             Your cousin all but lost his mind
             when they sent him to Korea.

             It is either the army or jail.
             There's something else, Vernon. I
             vouched for your integrity, but
             they've been poking in your
             background.

                           GLADYS
             He passed a bad check to put food
             on the table. They were hard
             times...

                           ELVIS
             We don't have nothing to be
             ashamed of! My daddy's a good man.

                           COLONEL
             But your papa did go to jail. And
             if you go, too? Well, you know how
             they are with their flashy
             headlines. Elvis the draft-dodger,
             a family of delinquents. We may
             never book another date or sell
             another record!

                           ELVIS
             This is my fault.

                           COLONEL
             My boy, don't blame yourself. I
             was partially responsible.

Colonel takes an "I Hate Elvis" pin from his pocket.

                           COLONEL
             But when I tried to warn you, you
             made your own choice. Now, to my
             way of thinking, the Army can be a
             new beginning for us all. Let them
             cut your hair, prove that you're a
             clean-cut, all- American boy, a
             patriot. Do your two years and
             when you come back, I promise you,
             I will have done everything to
             make you the biggest star in
             Hollywood! And you will choose
             your own pictures.

                           ELVIS
             It's gonna be ok, Mama...
                  (turning to Colonel)
             Do you think they'd let me do the
             movie before I ship off?

          I could get a deferment. So you
          will do the `King Creole' picture
          and then we'll be off.

Colonel nods, holding up the pin.

                        COLONEL
          But no more of this.

He throws the "I Hate Elvis" pin into the fire and the
word "hate" shrivels and melts in the flames.

Gladys' desperate sobs are drowned out by the angry growl
of HAIR CLIPPERS as we--

                                              TRANSITION TO:


INT. BARBERSHOP (FORT CHAFFEE) - DAY (1958)

Clippers cleave Elvis' rich, dark locks, sending them
cascading onto the cold, cement floor.

                        ELVIS
          Hair today, gone tomorrow.


INT. GRACELAND - NIGHT

A glass tumbler falls from Gladys' hand. She crumples to
the ground, distraught. Vernon stands, helpless.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

A choir sings a dark version of "Heartbreak Hotel" as Old
Colonel turns to see Gladys' casket in the distance.

                        OLD COLONEL
          She had fretted losing her second
          son her whole life.

As he gets closer, Elvis appears, crying over his mother.

                        OLD COLONEL
          I had to let the world know that
          my boy was a good, dutiful son,
          and nothing like the rebel
          delinquent they feared.
                                                        82.


INT. GRACELAND - MUSIC ROOM - DAY (1958)

The extended Presley clan gathers round the casket. Elvis
wails from the back of the house.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          I couldn't let a good funeral go
          to waste.

Colonel sees Vernon, destroyed, sitting at the foot of
the stairs. He moves towards him.

                        COLONEL
          There are some fine folk from the
          press out front... a few words,
          pictures... then they will leave
          us alone.

Vernon cuts him off, shaking his head. He nods towards a
back room and the sound of Elvis' inconsolable sobs.

                        VERNON
          He won't. I can't get him to do
          anything. I keep asking myself,
          what would she do?

                        COLONEL
          Yes, he trusted her like nobody
          else and now she's gone and what
          does he have now?

This thought cuts through to Vernon.

                        VERNON
          He has you... He trusts you! Talk
          to him.

Colonel, as if the thought had never occurred to him:

                        COLONEL
          It ain't my place...

                        VERNON
          Can you do it? Please Colonel, we
          need your help...

Colonel nods his head, making his way down the hall.


INT. GRACELAND - GLADYS' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Colonel enters. Elvis, inconsolable, curled up in the
closet with one of her dresses. After a moment...

             And now she can't even enjoy it.

                           COLONEL
                  (warmly)
             Your poor Daddy is doing the best
             he knows how but he is
             overwhelmed. He just keeps asking
             himself over and over again, what
             she would have done? He needs your
             help... out there.

                           ELVIS
             No, I can't go out there. I just
             want to stay here forever.

                           COLONEL
             My boy. No one could never replace
             her, but listen to me. From this
             moment on, anything she would have
             done, I will carry out in her
             name. While you are overseas I'll
             stay home and I will work and I
             will worry while you serve your
             time in the Army. Trust me.

The Colonel takes Elvis, guiding him gently to his feet.

                           COLONEL
             Now come, go stand by your Papa,
             comfort him, comfort your friends,
             family, and even your fans.
             Because if you don't, then all
             your Mama sacrificed for you will
             have been for nothing... Trust me.

Elvis nods his head gently and then, unexpectedly, lays
his head on the Colonel's shoulder and whispers:

                           ELVIS
             No matter what happens, stay with
             me through thick or thin, okay?

Colonel's hands move ever-so-slowly toward Elvis'
shoulders, barely touching them in a strange, suspended
gesture as Elvis weeps into his shoulder.

                           ELVIS
             You're like... you're like...

             I had done it; Elvis Presley would
             return a clean-cut, all-American
             boy. But I failed. I did not
             consider the most dangerous thing
             of all... love.

Colonel stands, now holding an umbrella, and looks out to
the misty streets of Bad Nauheim as a car drives past.


EXT. ELVIS' HOUSE (BAD NAUHEIM) - DUSK (1959)

An unprepossessing two-story cottage. Fans cluster around
the fence, craning their necks.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             ... love!!

SLOW CRANE UP OVER the front of the house, as we GLIMPSE
a party through the ground floor windows.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Suddenly, no one else existed but
             the pretty teenage daughter of a
             United States Air Force officer.

PUSH PAST leaves, THROUGH to a second-story window, where
we discover a beribboned ponytail against the glass.

                           PRISCILLA (O.S.)
             The second I walked in the door
             they started bombarding me with
             all these questions and I just
             said `Excuse me if you don't mind,
             please, I'd like to go to bed.'
             And then he said to me...

The girl turns. Doll-like, with cool, turquoise eyes:
PRISCILLA BEAULIEU. She looks down on the fans below.

                           PRISCILLA
                  (imitating a man)
             `You know Priscilla, he's got
             girls all over the world, okay?
             Girls that are waiting outside his
             house. Girls that are writing him
             endless fan mail.' And then Mommy
             says to me, `Oh my goodness, what
             could he possibly see in you? What
             do you two do up there all night?'
             And I just said...
                                                      86.


INT. ELVIS' HOUSE (BAD NAUHEIM) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Peculiar bric-a-brac fills Elvis' room. Bags of fan mail,
piles of stuffed animals. THROUGH the open door, we see
several other officers and their dates milling around.

                        PRISCILLA
          `We talk and listen to music,
          that's all. The fan mail and those
          other girls, that's just his job.'
          And then they were going on about
          that photo of you and Natalie Wood
          riding around on that bike in
          Memphis...

We FOLLOW Priscilla as she gets down to join Elvis,
sitting on the floor in his military uniform.

                        PRISCILLA
          But then I said, and I said this
          very calmly: `Listen, he's just
          lonely and quite frankly, so am
          I.' And they didn't have anything
          to say to that, so I just went to
          bed.

                        ELVIS
          I've never met anyone like you.

                          PRISCILLA
          I hope not...

                        ELVIS
          You understand it all.

                        PRISCILLA
          I don't think I understand it all,
          I think I just understand you.
               (then; masking
                jealousy)
          What is Natalie Wood like?

                        ELVIS
          She's nice. She's been writing to
          me about acting. You know, I'm
          making a study of Marlon Brando
          and James Dean. Natalie writes
          about working with him, and `Rebel
          Without a Cause.'

                          PRISCILLA
          `Rebel'?

                        ELVIS
          You've never seen `Rebel Without a
          Cause'?

                           ELVIS (CONT'D)
             Oh, that's one of my favorite
             movies. James Dean, he's a genius
             at acting. God, I just hope to one
             day be as good as him. The
             Colonel's promised me that when I
             get back, he's gonna set me up in
             Hollywood to be a serious actor...
                  (suddenly shy)
             It's really what I dream of.

A young sergeant, CHARLIE HODGE, appears at the doorway.

                           CHARLIE
             E.P., you promised the Captain
             you'd have her back by 7.

                           ELVIS
             Hey Charlie, what's that behind
             you?

Charlie turns away as Elvis slams the door shut.

                           ELVIS
             He don't boss me around.

Elvis looks out the french doors, onto the street where
fans are still staring up. He closes the curtains.

Priscilla, now standing by Elvis' side, looks up to him
and fills him with confidence as she says:

                           PRISCILLA
             Well, I think if you dream it,
             you'll do it.

                            ELVIS
             You do?

                            PRISCILLA
             I really do.

                            ELVIS
             Yeah?

                            PRISCILLA
             Yeah.

For the first time since Gladys' death, someone believes
in him. They look at each other and kiss.


INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY     (1960)

Elvis appears behind a tangle of microphones.

                           ELVIS
             Well, sir, that's my big ambition.
             It takes a lot of time, a lot of
             experience, but I hope I make it.
             That's what I wanna do.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             He was as good as Brando. But you
             didn't want to see him in movies
             where he didn't sing!


HOLLYWOOD MOVIE MONTAGE - ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE (1960S)

We see a TRAILER-STYLE MONTAGE of 60s ELVIS FILMS as he's
hidden away in a Hollywood bubble.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Thanks to me, his life became one
             big Hollywood movie!


INT. ELVIS' VISTA-LINER BUS - DAY

Elvis and Priscilla, lying on a bed in an oddly-shaped
room, swathed entirely in red velvet.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Starring Priscilla!

As the intro to `Viva Las Vegas' kicks, Elvis pulls a
curtain to reveal they are in fact on his decked-out
VISTALINER BUS as it speeds through the desert. Suddenly,
Priscilla has her iconic beehive and a glam 60s look!

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Bright light city gonna set my
             soul, gonna set my soul on fire!

They sashay down the bus, as members of the Memphis Mafia
pop their heads out of every nook and cranny.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             And a cast of his buddies and
             cousins, his `Memphis Mafia'!

The bus hurtles through an abstract, neon Vegas as their
Hollywood romance plays out through clips from 60s Elvis
films and realist Super 8 footage.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The gang all attend Elvis and Priscilla's wedding.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             There was a fairytale wedding. And
             a honeymoon, on Frank Sinatra's
             jet!


INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Now Priscilla cradles newborn baby LISA MARIE.

                           OLD COLONEL ICE (V.O.)
             And introducing baby Lisa Marie!


INT. SOUNDSTAGE (REAR PROJECTION) - DAY

Elvis water-skis with THREE BIKINI-CLAD GIRLS in front of
a rear-projected body of water.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             I made him the highest paid actor
             in Hollywood history. We had a lot
             of fun! But Elvis was a young man,
             and of course, he got distracted.
             So we made them faster and
             cheaper. Is it my fault the world
             changed?

BANG! The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
provides an abrupt gear shift into "Edge of Reality."

We GO WIDE to reveal the back projection set surrounding
Elvis as he water skis. PRODUCTON CREW hurl buckets of
water across Elvis' face.


INT. ELVIS' VISTA-LINER BUS - DAY

Elvis is learning his lines. Jerry, fielding a phone call
further down the bus. Suddenly, Elvis notices over
Jerry's shoulder on the TV, Walter Cronkite with a news
bulletin: the shocking reality that MLK has been
assassinated in Memphis.

             Dark shadows follow me...

Rising in disbelief, Elvis slowly makes his way towards
the television as Jerry turns up the volume. Both men are
completely numb.


INT. MGM SOUNDSTAGE - ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE

Elvis, clad in a blue pajama suit, films the "Edge of
Reality" number from Live a Little, Love a Little.

                            ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Here's where life's dream lies
             disillusioned,
             The edge of reality...

We continue to INTERCUT between the back projection,
ridiculous films, and archival footage of Vietnam, the
Beatles, the Civil Rights movement, etc.

Headlines appear: "NEW ELVIS STINKER BOMBS!" "ANOTHER
FLOP!" "THERE'S NO MORE APPETITE FOR PRESLEY PICTURES!"


EXT. MGM BACKLOT - DAY

We come off the sign on the water tower that reads, "MGM
Studios." We pick up a golf cart traveling through the
MGM backlot Western set.

It quickly veers towards Elvis' Vista-Liner surrounded by
an assortment of cars, a mirror image of the 1950s carny
camp. As the golf cart pulls to a halt, the Memphis Mafia
can be seen having a water fight.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             It don't matter how hard I worked,
             how many snow jobs I came up with,
             how much snow I made them. My boy
             loved to spend and with them
             hillbillies around him, the money
             would just melt away...

Billy, alighting from the golf cart, is carrying Elvis'
blue pajama costume. He passes Vernon and Priscilla,
talking quietly:

                           VERNON
             With the sale of Circle G, horses,
             vehicles...

             that will cover the payroll. But

             gonna have to wait.

As Billy enters the Vista-Liner...


INT. ELVIS' VISTA-LINER BUS - DAY

He can see Walter Cronkite on the television behind the
driver's seat.

                           WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)
                  (on TV)
             Dr. Martin Luther King, the
             apostle of nonviolence in the
             civil rights movement, has been
             shot to death in Memphis,
             Tennessee...

                           BILLY
             They need you on set, EP.

Billy looks around and can see Elvis, collapsed on the
banquette, devastated. Jerry sits next to him.

                           ELVIS
                  (in disbelief)
             Dr. King. He always spoke the
             truth.

"Edge of Reality" reaches its finish, and we hear...

TRACK ACROSS a table with models of a European village,
Santa's sleigh, dancing girls. A festive-sweatered Elvis

Vernon and the Memphis Mafia admire Singer sewing
machines, vacuum cleaners, and more. Priscilla stands at
a distance, watching a Singer portable television as it
plays news of riots back in Memphis.

Elvis holds baby Lisa Marie, looking upon all the

                           COLONEL
             And for this, the sponsors at

             Unprecedented profit
             participation. Provided you appear

Elvis joins Priscilla, handing her Lisa Marie. They
glance at what's playing out on the television.

                           PRISCILLA
             Memphis is burning...

Vernon looks to Elvis for his approval.

             `Elvis Presley's Wonderful World

             It's gonna be a lot of fun. I hope
             Presley Enterprises are dreaming
             of a white Christmas because it's
             definitely gonna snow!

                           ELVIS
             A Christmas special? Is this
             really the best you can do,
             Admiral?

                           PRISCILLA
             We came to Hollywood, Colonel, so
             Elvis could be a serious actor.

          My dear, for the last 5 years,
          your husband has been the highest
          paid actor in Hollywood!

                        ELVIS
          And now I'm unemployable.

                        COLONEL
          We took these Hollywood phonies
          for every nickel they had. It's
          time to pack our tent and move on
          to greener pastures. We've had
          Elvis the rebel. Elvis the movie
          star. Now we're going to see
          Elvis, the family entertainer.

Jerry pipes up.

                        JERRY
          And appliance salesman?

Big laughs. Elvis looks to Jerry with a face like
thunder.

                         ELVIS
          You think that's funny? I don't
          need you to question me about what
          I gotta do to support my family
          and every person here. Is that
          goddamn clear?

Elvis slams into the Vista-Liner.

                        COLONEL
               (to Priscilla)
          I'm sorry, my dear.
               (to Jerry)
          Well, Mr. Schilling, Elvis'
          audience is no longer screaming
          teenage girls. They are grown-ups;
          they are wives and mothers and
          they watch television and they buy
          sewing machines.
               (remembering)
          Ah, the radio promotions... Would
          you take that in to Mr. Presley
          and play it for him to get his
          approval?

                        JERRY
          Colonel, I don't work for you.
               (indicating the bus)
          I'm just a friend of that guy in
          there.

Colonel, a murderous look. He turns to Vernon.

                         COLONEL
           Well, Vernon, shall we begin to
           draw up the contracts?

                          VERNON
           Let's do it.


INT. ELVIS' VISTA-LINER BUS - DAY

Elvis, fuming, storms in and rips off his collar. The
aftermath of the Dr. King assassination plays on the TV.

                         BILLY
           Hey EP, do you wanna run lines?

                          ELVIS
           Mhmm.

                         BILLY
           Okay. So uh... Greg walks up to
           the receptionist dressed in a
           lingerie cat costume. `Aren't you
           cold?'

                         ELVIS
           Huh? No I'm fine.

                         BILLY
           No, that's the line.


                          ELVIS
           Oh.
                (with a smarmy wink)
           `Aren't you cold?'

A KNOCK.

                         BILLY
                (seductively)
           `Only from nine to five.'

Billy returns to his bunk as Jerry enters.

                          JERRY
           I'm sorry.

Elvis refuses to acknowledge him.

                         JERRY
                (treads cautiously)
           I've been offered a job here in
           L.A. I'm gonna take it.

Elvis is suddenly at a loss.

                           ELVIS
             Hey, man... I wasn't angry at you.
             Let me make it up to you. There's
             a new Shelby Cobra coming out.
             I'll buy you some new wheels.

                           JERRY
             It's got nothing to do with money.

Elvis lets this sink in; no one talks to him like this.

                           ELVIS
             Man, I need you here as a friend.

Jerry stops, the anger has abated. He nods his head to
the TV, where James Brown and the Rolling Stones perform.

                           JERRY
             These TV guys. They're the ones
             that put James Brown and the
             Rolling Stones on the T.A.M.I
             Show. They're really plugged in, I
             met them.

Elvis nods.

                           JERRY
             I could set up a meeting.

Elvis is interested, but he masks it flippantly.

                           ELVIS
             To see what they can do with `Here
             Comes Santa Clause?'

                           JERRY
                  (playing along)
             Peace, love, and Christmas
             cookies. Could be crazy...

Suddenly, Charlie's voice:

                           CHARLIE (O.S.)
             Colonel's already got the guy who
             does all the Singer specials.

Elvis and Jerry turn to see Charlie in the doorway. He is
delivering the tape recorder with the promotion tape
already loaded, setting it down on the bed. We don't know
how long Charlie's been listening.




                                                  (CONTINUED)

          Colonel wants you to listen to
          this and approve it. Then they
          want you back on set in five.

Charlie leaves as Billy enters to start dressing Elvis.

                        JERRY
          I'm just saying, you should work
          with new people...

Jerry's words hang in the air, clearly about more than
just the TV special. Before he leaves, Jerry turns back
to Elvis.

                        JERRY
          Its like you always say, EP.
          Colonel's got a lot of ideas.


EXT. ELVIS' VISTA-LINER BUS - NIGHT

It's late. Priscilla sits in the limo, amidst a convoy of
cars idling outside the Vista-Liner. Billy packs away an
Elvis standee in the boot of a car.

                        BILLY
          That's the last of it.

Charlie approaches Priscilla's window, leaning in.

                        CHARLIE
          He's just laying in there,
          watching the Reverend's funeral...

                        PRISCILLA
          I'll go check on him. Thank you.

Priscilla exits and approaches the bus.

          "Here Comes Santa Claus" that was!

On the back television, sound muted: somber images of

Discover Elvis, sprawled on the red velvet bed. The tape
recorder next to him. His blank stare illuminated in the
dark by the blue light of the television.

                           ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             ... heeeeere's Elvis!

CLICK. The tape recorder stops.

Elvis stares blankly at the television. His breathing
heavy. Tears begin to form in his eyes. Suddenly, the
sound of the door opening.

                           PRISCILLA
                  (quietly)
             Satnin'. Can I watch the memorial
             with you?

                           ELVIS
             Please.

Priscilla slides into the bed beside him.

                           ELVIS
             I'm so tired of playing Elvis
             Presley.

                           PRISCILLA
             You don't have to. We could run
             away to France or Italy and live
             off the land. Eat baguettes,
             snails, and cheese. Little Lisa
             could learn French.

Elvis breathes deep, fighting for control.

                           ELVIS
             I wish we could. Too many people
             rely on me.

                           PRISCILLA
             I love you. Your daughter loves
             you. We don't care about the money
             or anything else. We just want you
             to be happy. You're only really
             happy when you sing the music you
             love.

ON THE SCREEN: MAHALIA JACKSON steps up to the microphone
and begins to sing "Take My Hand, Precious Lord."

                        ELVIS
               (distant; broken)
          That's Mahalia Jackson... I used
          to hear her sing at East Trigg
          Church. That's the music that
          makes me happy.

Elvis eases the sound of the television up on the remote.
With this, a MATCH SHOT as...


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

Mahalia and CHOIR now appear. In front of them at the
pulpit, the fiery REVEREND BREWSTER:

                        REVEREND BREWSTER
          Many have lost their lives for
          this cause, so remember, when
          things are too dangerous to say...
          sing!

The choir lifts Mahalia's voice higher.

                        MAHALIA
               (sings)
          Joshua fought the battle of

                        MAHALIA AND CHOIR
               (sing)
          Joshua fought the battle of
             Jericho, and the walls came
             tumbling down!

A sudden blast of HEAVY ROCK MUSIC.


EXT. LOS ANGELES - AERIAL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON (1968)

The rock continues as a convoy of 2 BLACK CARS and a BLUE
LIMO cuts through the Hollywood Hills.


INT. LIMO - LATE AFTERNOON

MUSIC LOUD as inside one of the cars, two groovy hepcats,
STEVE BINDER (35) and BONES HOWE (35), sit facing
backwards. They stare intensely, barely breathing.

Seated opposite, Sonny and Red West stare blankly back.
                                                        99.


EXT. LOS ANGELES - AERIAL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON

Music builds as the convoy threads the road that traces
up to and above the derelict Hollywood sign.


EXT. LOOKOUT ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN - LATE AFTERNOON

The convoy squeals to a dusty halt near Jerry, who has
been waiting for them. Memphis Mafia jump out and open
the door of the limo. Binder and Bones get out.

                        JERRY
          Mr. Binder, Mr. Howe, thanks for
          coming... One thing, gentlemen:
          don't call it a Christmas Special.

Binder and Bones nervously glance at one another; the
whole thing feels like some kind of elaborate Mafia hit.
The Wests stay back as Jerry leads Binder and Bones down
a dusty dirt track.


EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As they round a bend, DISCOVER Elvis, haloed by the
setting sun, sitting on part of the dilapidated sign and
gazing across the valley toward Griffith Observatory.

Jerry hangs back, but motions that Binder and Bones
should approach. They do so...

Elvis continues to stare as he senses their presence.

                        ELVIS
          When I first came to Hollywood,
          I'd come up here and sit for
          hours. Right over there is where
          they shot Rebel. I dreamt of
          being a great actor like Jimmy
          Dean. This sign was beautiful
          then, and now... It feels as
          though lots of things are like
          that these days; broke down, beat-
          up, rotten.
               (turning to them)
          I really liked what you guys did
          putting James Brown together with
          the Rolling Stones.

                        BINDER
               (extremely nervous)
          We're big fans of yours, too.
          It's, just, uh, Mr. Presley...

             Elvis. Christmas specials aren't
             our thing, man.

Elvis looks at them sharply-- then, that charming smile.

                           ELVIS
             I know. But tell me honestly,
             where do you boys think my
             career's at right now?

                           BONES

             Ah, well, it's...

                  (direct)
             In the toilet, Elvis.

Elvis, half a beat of shock. And then he laughs, really
laughs, like he hasn't in years.

                           ELVIS
                  (to Jerry)
             You hear that Jerry?
                  (to Binder and Bones)
             I knew you were the right guys for
             this job!

He jumps down from the sign.

                            ELVIS
             When I was starting out, some
             people wanted to put me in jail,
             hell, even kill me, `cause of the
             way I moved. They cut my hair,
             put me in uniform, and sent me
             away. It killed my mama... And
             ever since, I been lost. When
             you're lost...
                  (a cautious thought)
             People take advantage. I thought
             you fellas might help me get back
             to who I really am.

Binder and Bones are affected by Elvis' honesty.

                           BINDER
                  (probing)
             Who are you, Elvis?

                        BINDER
               (cautiously)
          What does the Colonel think?

Suddenly, Elvis flares up.

                        ELVIS
          I don't give a damn what the
          Colonel thinks.

                        BONES
          I see... Well, if you want to find
          yourself, first thing you do is to
          go home.

Binder picks up the cue.

                        BINDER
          Metaphorically speaking. You know,
          get back to who you really are,
          musically.

Elvis is not sure, Bones chimes in:

                        BONES
          Yeah, we could get your old band
          back together...

                        BINDER
          Play the tracks that made people
          call you the devil and trash your
          records in the street.

                        BONES
          A leather jacket; raw and dirty!

                        BINDER
          But first, you need an audience.

Elvis smashed by nerves, barely able to say the word:

                        ELVIS
          Audience?
               (tries to laugh it
                off)
          No, man... I haven't played in
          front of an audience in ten years.

                        BINDER
          That's my point.

Binder and Bones look at each other, blindsided, as the
decrepit Hollywood sign transforms into...


EXT. NBC STUDIOS - DAY

A sign: "NBC COLOR CITY."


INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - DAY

Elvis stands on the stage steps with Priscilla and Jerry,
looking out at the studio and its empty bleachers.

                        JERRY
          The Blossoms are set to tape the
          Gospel sequence tomorrow, but
          first it's you in the round, the
          acoustic set with Scotty and DJ,
          everything with the audience.
          Colonel won't give us any static
          so long as we do the two Christmas
          numbers in the...

Jerry looks up. Elvis seems disturbed.

                        JERRY
          He's got to keep the Singer execs
          happy.

Jerry looks to Priscilla, tense.

                            ELVIS
             I like that.

Priscilla moves closer to Elvis.

                           PRISCILLA
             Honey, Binder's whole idea was
             that the world sees you how I see
             you at home. Making jokes with
             your friends, laughing, having
             fun, playing the music you love.

                           ELVIS
             My hands are sweaty.

                           PRISCILLA
             Look at me. I know you're scared.
             It's scary, but the man I love has
             never done anything extraordinary
             without fear.

                           ELVIS
             Yeah, you know, I just... I don't
             know if I can be that without a
             script.

Elvis walks to center stage, looking around.

                           ELVIS
             What if nothing comes?

As he turns, we PUSH IN, the roar of the crowd audible...


INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - LATER

Bones stands in Elvis' place, warming up the LIVE
AUDIENCE who fills the bleachers. Applause sign flashing.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - DAY

Stoic-looking SINGER SEWING EXECUTIVES follow behind
Colonel as he speaks, Diskin dutifully behind him. A
Christmas Sweater is wheeled past by an assistant.

                           COLONEL
             Mr. Presley is interested in a few
             of Mr. Bindle's ideas but... Ahh,
             the Christmas sweater!

                   (to the Singer Execs)
             We will be singing at least three
             spectacular Christmas songs in
             that very sweater. To the control
             room.

Colonel ushers the group to the stairs.

                           COLONEL
             It was knitted on the SK551--

                           DISKIN
                  (whispers)
             The SK155.

                           COLONEL
             Oh the SK155. Thank you, Mr
             Diskin.

The group continues up the stairs...


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

... and arrives in the control room where Binder and AN
ASSISTANT sit behind the desk.

                           COLONEL
             There will be `Silence is the
             Night,' `Here Comes Santa Claus.'
             And Diskin what's the one about
             the boy?

                           DISKIN
             The Little Drummer Boy.

                           COLONEL
             Yes, the Little Drummer Boy.

                           SENIOR SINGER EXEC
             Ahh... yes.

The Singer executive mimes drumming.

                           COLONEL
             We're going to be starting with
             `Here Comes Santa Claus.' Isn't
             that right, Bindle?

                           BINDER
             Absolutely, the Christmas numbers
             will come later in the show.
                                                       105.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - DAY

FAST TRACK WITH and UP Elvis' black-leather-clad legs,
FOLLOWING him as he charges through the corridor.

                        BONES (V.O.)
          And now, ladies and gentlemen...


INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE/CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As we ENTER the studio, Priscilla touches Elvis' hand
discreetly. The FLOOR MANAGER guides her to her place.

                        BONES
          ... here's Elvis Presley!

Elvis takes the stage like a boxer entering the ring, met
with polite applause. These aren't the adoring fans he
once knew. He nervously clears his throat.

                        ELVIS
          Well, I gotta do this sooner or
          later, so it might as well do it
          now, baby...

He cues the band-- a mistimed opening stab and Elvis
misses the cue. A ripple of confusion through the
audience.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Bones enters the control room and shares a worried look
with Binder. The Colonel can see Elvis' face on all the
monitors, sweating, insecure. He hisses to Binder:

                        COLONEL
          This is precisely why he shouldn't
          be in front of a live audience.

                        BINDER
               (over intercom)
          Sorry, E.P., technical problem...

                        COLONEL
          Get them out now, and let's get on
          with the Christmas number!

The hard-faced SINGER EXECUTIVES are confused. Binder
looks to Bones, and then to the monitors.

                        BINDER
               (a second intercom)
          Standby for `Here Comes Santa
          Clause.'

Colonel pretends to be in control. Diskin nods along.

                           COLONEL
                  (to Singer Execs)
             Technical difficulties... Please
             standby.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The DANCE CAPTAIN leads a posse of DANCING SANTAS,
stretching and preparing to go on.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Elvis looks to Priscilla in the shadows, sensing a do-or-
die moment. He cracks a joke with a wry smile:

                           ELVIS
             How do you like it so far?

The audience laughs, a sudden connection.

We PUSH IN ON the monitor of one of the TV cameras as
Elvis throws back his head, cues the band, and... music
and voice come together in a tremendous, rocking entry:

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Well, since my baby left me...
             I found a new place to dwell
             It's down at the end of lonely
                street
             At Heartbreak Hotel...

He connects with the audience as only Elvis can. Elvis
Presley is reborn.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Binder and Bones look on with pride. Colonel's face
falls. The Singer Executives seem uncertain.

                           JUNIOR SINGER EXEC
             Well, that was... energetic.

                           SENIOR SINGER EXEC
             Is `Here Comes Santa Claus' next?

                           COLONEL
             Absolutely! I see no reason why
             not.

He thunders out of the room, Diskin in tow.
                                                    107.

             cryin' all the time.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Colonel hurtles down the stairs, huffing and puffing.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Elvis launches into "Jailhouse Rock."

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Warden threw a party in the county
             jail,
          The prison band was there and they
             began to wail...

The crowd erupts into applause. Priscilla can't believe
her eyes.

                        ELVIS
          Thank you! It's been a long time,
          baby! My boy, my boy!


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Colonel bounds down the stairs with Diskin.

                        COLONEL
          I do not know what is going on.
          Sweating in black leather, singing
          `Hound Dog,' what does that have
          to do with Christmas?

They reach the corridor and suddenly, Scotty Moore and
D.J. Fontana cross Colonel's path. He turns to Diskin:

                        COLONEL
          The Blue Moon Boys?! What are they
          doing here?!

Colonel follows them towards the stage.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - LATER

The musicians are now gathered on the stage to do the sit-
down section.

                           ELVIS
             OK... Well goodnight...

Elvis jokingly pretends to leave.

                            ELVIS
             Uh, are we on television? Are we
             on television?

                           CHARLIE
             No, we're on a train to Tulsa.

                           ELVUS
             Let's see, what do I do now folks?

                           SCOTTY
             Why don't you play that `Trying To
             Get To You' one time?

                           ELVIS
             Twelve years he played guitar for
             me man, didn't say anything. Now
             let me swap that axe with you,
             champ.

With this, they exchange guitars and settle in. Elvis
launches into "Trying to Get to You," raw and intense,
while staring at Priscilla.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Ever since I read your letter,
             Where you said you loved me true,
             I've been traveling night and day
             I've kept running all the way
             Baby, trying to get to you.

Everyone in the control room watches on with delight.
Colonel watches from the shadows, the realization dawning
that they've all been conspiring against him. He leaves
in a fury.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Diskin is offering refreshments as Colonel thunders in,
out of breath, barking at Binder:

                           COLONEL
             Talks? No, no, no. What does Elvis
             talk about?

                              BINDER
             About himself.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - DAY

                           ELVIS
             Alright, give me that piece of
             paper, man. I'm gonna see what I'm
             supposed to do next here.

Charlie hands Elvis the cue sheet.

                           ELVIS
             It says here, `Elvis will talk
             about first record...'

                              CHARLIE
             Little late.

                           ELVIS
             It says here, `Elvis will talk
             about shooting from the waist down
             and not being able to touch hands
             with body-- body with hands.'
                  (laughs)
             I just got this show off the air,
             boy, I tell you.

The boys laugh at the ludicrous suggestion. Elvis looks
around and tosses the cue sheet aside. The audience
laughs. After a moment, Elvis speaks from the heart:

                           ELVIS
             Anyway... I'd like to talk a
             little about music... Very little.
             There's been a big change in the
             music field in the last ten or
             twelve years. And uh, I like a lot
             of the new groups, the Beatles and
             the Beards, and the whoever...

CONTINUED:
                           ELVIS (CONT'D)
             But a lot of it is basically, our
             music is basically... rock 'n'
             roll music is basically, uh...
             Gospel or rhythm and blues.
             People have been adding to it,
             adding instruments to it,
             experimenting with it. But it uh,
             it all boils down to just uh... I
             don't know what I'm talking about
             really, I'm just mumbling, man.

                           SCOTTY
             Hey, Elvis, why don't you talk
             about, uh... little finger?

They share a look-- connecting.

                           ELVIS
             The little finger. Yeah that's all
             I could move at Russwood.

Elvis thinks back...

                           ELVIS
             The uh, the police filmed the show
             on the 4th of July in Memphis
             because the PTA or the YMCA or
             somebody, they thought I was uh...
             something.

As the audience chuckles, Elvis' eyes flick up to Colonel
in the control room.

                           ELVIS
             So uh, the police came out to film
             the show. So they told me I
             couldn't move, I had to stand
             still. The only thing I could move
             was my little finger like that,
             man.
                  (wiggles finger)
             You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
             Crying all the time...
             If you're looking for trouble, you
             came to the right place...

The band and audience crack up as the soulful strains of
"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child," sung by
Darlene Love begins...

                           ELVIS
             But, uh, that's one thing about
             this TV special that I'm doing.
             They're gonna let me do what I
             wanna do...

Elvis watches from the shadows, singing to himself.

INT. NBC STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - DAY

Colonel yells at the Floor Manager:

                        COLONEL
          Young man, you tell them it's time
          for `Here Comes Santa Claus.' I
          said so. Now, now!

                        FLOOR MANAGER
          First positions! Not here, out
          there! Go, go. Sleighs! Where's
          the sleigh?

Santas stub out cigarettes and don their hats! A large
wooden sleigh is dragged into position.

THROUGH the glass at the back of the room, we see Colonel

             segue straight into the whorehouse
             and kung-fu spectacular. Go!

The Singer Executives stare with unforgiving horror and
head for the exit. A final word to Colonel.

                            SENIOR SINGER EXEC
             You'll be hearing from our
             lawyers. Santa Claus is bringing
             you a lawsuit!

             But we have `Little Drummer Boy'!

Colonel turns. Through the monitors, we--

INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

Colonel is surrounded by monitors showing Elvis in the
different dance numbers. As he spins:

                           OLD COLONEL
             Kung-fu fighters! An all-colors-of-
             the-rainbow ballet!

Colonel keeps spinning around to see the monitor with
Elvis in the bordello number.

                           OLD COLONEL
             This was not part of the plan! And
             it was a good plan!

TOP SHOT: Suddenly Colonel is revealed on the NBC stage
amongst a flower of fans and bordello dancers.

                           OLD COLONEL
             Street whores... To sell sewing
             machines at Christmas time!

He's aggressed by multiple gospel singers, kung-fu
fighters, bordello girls. The music intensifies into an
orchestral cacophony, the memory of the comeback takes on
a nightmarish quality.

SUDDENLY, THE SOUND OF A GUNSHOT!

          They shot him! Bobby! Kennedy!!!


INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - NIGHT (1968)

The tragic news tears through the cast as they rush from
the stage.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

Old Colonel, once again alone on the carpet of Space,
stares at thousands of 1970s televisions on which the
Kennedy tragedy plays out.

PUSH IN on a screen: images from the Ambassador Hotel.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The whole cast and crew, many in tears, gather around the
TV, which plays news of the Robert Kennedy assassination.
Elvis' eyes are glued to the screen.

                        NBC FLOOR MANAGER
          Steve, we gotta get back to work.

Binder stands:

                        BINDER
          Listen... I just want to say that
          I'm looking at all of us...

          Jewish director, black

          Our gentleman from Tupelo... And
          to me, this is the kind of nation
          we are. Right here. In this room.
          And we cannot end this show with
          `Here Comes Santa Claus.' We have
          to say something. You have to make
          a statement, E.P.

             Mr. Presley does not make
             statements.

The curtain that hides Elvis' bedroom is slowly drawn
back. It's the Colonel. He walks in and stares the entire
room down.

                           COLONEL
             He sings `Here Comes Santa Claus',
             and wishes everyone `Merry
             Christmas' and `Goodnight.'

Colonel's jabs at the dial; the screen goes black.

                           COLONEL
             The show must go on.

The West cousins and the Floor Manager move everyone out
of the room. Elvis says nothing. Faces fall, disgusted by
the cowardice of the King.


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM

It's late and Bones is making coffee for himself and
Binder as they watch coverage of the Robert Kennedy
shooting on the monitors. PUSH IN ON: a monitor.


INT. NBC - DRESSING ROOM - LATER

MATCH SHOT: pull out on a miniature TV in Elvis' dressing
room. Billy helps Elvis into his robe.

                           COLONEL
             Poor Mrs. Kennedy. A tragedy, a
             tragedy... But it has nothing to
             do with us.

Suddenly, Elvis bursts through the curtains.

                           ELVIS
             It has everything to do with us...

                           COLONEL
             I just do not think we should be
             making speeches about politics and
             religion.

             Dr. King was shot eight miles from

But Elvis does not back down...

                           ELVIS
             Well I'm Elvis Presley. That's
             what I do.

The Colonel's eye takes on that crocodile gleam.

                           COLONEL
             Well, Mr. Bindle has really gotten
             inside your head with all of his
             hippy friends. You actually think
             that singing your old songs
             dressed in black leather,
             sweating, mumbling incoherently to
             the audience, was a good show?

                           ELVIS
             Colonel, I know when I've excited
             an audience.

The Colonel rounds on him.

                           COLONEL
             That was not a real audience my
             boy. There was a sign flashing
             `applaud' telling them when to
             clap for you.

This touches Elvis' Achilles heel. The Colonel knows he's
landed a blow and drives in, brandishing his cane.

                            COLONEL
             This entire jamboree is an
             embarrassment!
                   (thud goes the cane)
             You have embarrassed the
             sponsors...
                   (off thud)
             You have embarrassed yourself...
                   (off thud)
             And you have embarrassed me...
                   (off thud)
             Now, you can sing whatever songs
             you and Mr. Bindle choose for 55
             minutes, but at the end of the
             show there will be a Christmas
             song.

          because I will no longer be the
          promoter your career... I will
          have to leave you.

Elvis takes this in. Colonel makes his way to the door.

                        COLONEL
          I have convinced our friends at
          Singer to come back tomorrow for
          `Here Comes Santa Claus.' I'll see
          you in the morning, Mr.
          Presley.
               (turning before he
                exits)
          Oh, and as I recall, Dr. King said
          rock and roll contributed to
          juvenile delinquency.

Elvis turns back to the television. PUSH IN ON: L.B.J. on
the television and MATCH CUT TO:


INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM/STAGE - NIGHT

L.B.J. on the monitor in the control room. Binder turns
off the three monitors with a `click, click, click.'
Bones behind him. He notices Elvis down in the studio.

CUT TO: the abandoned studio floor. A stark work light
slashes the Santa set, where Elvis stands in deep
contemplation. He sings a couple of melancholic lines
from "Here Comes Santa Claus."

Elvis looks up to Binder in the control room.

                        BINDER
          It's pretty familiar territory...
          Is it okay if we just run through
          it in the morning?

He looks to Bones, pulling on his jacket to leave, weary
with disappointment. Elvis stares back at Binder and
Bones, defiance in his eyes...

                        ELVIS
          A reverend told me once: `When
          things are too dangerous to say...

Time passes and the piano chords transform into a warm,
stirring brass section.

We once again see Colonel barreling along past the window
at the back of the room, wearing a Christmas sweater.
Diskin, also in sweater, and Charlie Hodge in tow.

          New song? No.

Colonel enters the control room.

"Here Comes Santa Claus."

Colonel turns to the Singer Executives, but before he can
speak, we hear the stirring brass, and the Singer

Suddenly, the TV cameras turn away from the Santa set and
towards the giant "ELVIS" letters illuminated in red.

The Colonel moves in disbelief to the window as a crane
with a CAMERAMAN sweeps in front of his reddening face.

Colonel's face is like thunder. Diskin, inscrutable, yet
an undeniable inner approval.

Just then, Priscilla walks in. She shares a look with
Binder and stands by him.

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
          Deep in my heart there's a
             tremblin' question
          Still I am sure that the answer,
             answer's gonna come somehow
          Out there in the dark, there's a

          While I can dream, please let my
             dream
          Come true, right now!!!

Colonel, now walking away from the Elvis set, back into
the ghostly casino whence he came.

                        OLD COLONEL
          I was certain it was going to be a
          disaster.

We STAY ON Colonel's face as it transforms.

          But I was wrong.

Never before have we seen the Colonel so vulnerable.


EXT. GRACELAND - DAY (1969)

A lively picnic to the sounds of Elvis' `Memphis
Tennessee.' Elvis and Priscilla race around on a golf
cart. A new era at Graceland.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

Old Colonel sits ever-so-slowly at the roulette table,
his face frozen in catatonic despair. He SCREAMS...

                                               (CONTINUED)
                                                       122.

                           OLD COLONEL
             Wrong!

His breath heavy, full of self-pity.

                           OLD COLONEL
             All those years I stood by him.
             One little mistake and he leaves
             me?!


INT. GRACELAND - MUSIC ROOM - AFTERNOON (1969)

Graceland, completely reimagined in a hip, sixties look,
with an equally hip cocktail party in swing. Elvis,
Priscilla, Jerry ,and a cool, rangy character, TOM
HULETT, look over the plans for a touring plane.

                           JERRY
             Air Presley's new wings.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             I'll fly away, oh glory
             I'll fly away, in my Convair 880.

                           HULETT
             With a state room in the back,
             extra seating in the front.

                           PRISCILLA
             You mean we can sleep on the
             plane?

                           HULETT
             That's the whole point! When you
             play stadiums, it's like a week of
             shows in just one night. So when
             it's done, you hop on the plane
             and go where you want...

                           ELVIS
             "Go where you want, play where you
             want, and if they don't like it,
             go some place else." B.B. King
             told me that.

                           HULETT
             B.B. knows, man... I've been doing
             some research. Last year alone,
             you turned down two offers in
             Germany and Japan for a million
             bucks... for one night! You know
             who gets offers like that?

Elvis shrugs.

                           HULETT
             Nobody... Nobody except Elvis.
             Aaron. Presley. Just last week,
             with our newest group, Led
             Zeppelin, they sold out the
             Coliseum in Vancouver. Just
             imagine what you could do. Why the
             Colonel turned them down is beyond
             me.

                           JERRY
             Well if you figure it out, let us
             know.

A tense moment. Elvis spies little LISA MARIE and picks
her up.

                           PRISCILLA
             We should call it the "Lisa
             Marie." Are you guys hungry? Let's
             eat.

Joining Vernon, his new wife, DEE, Charlie, Lamar and
girlfriends, they hold court like the Kennedys.

They all sit down for dinner. A phone RINGS. Charlie pops
out, and back in.

                           CHARLIE
             Hey EP, it's the Colonel.

                           ELVIS
             Not now, Charlie. I'm sitting down
             to dinner with my family.

                           CHARLIE
                  (into the phone)
             You're gonna have to call back
             later.

                           ELVIS
                  (to the table)
             I want you to get me some songs. I
             want you to get me some songs,
             too. I want every one of you, if
             you know somebody, to get me some
             songs.

                           LAMAR
             Hey, I got something from a young
             guy, Eddie Rabbitt: "Kentucky
             Rain" You've got to do it. It's
             just that good.

We PAN to the dining room chandelier as the lights turn
on, signaling the transition to night.
                                                    124.


INT. GRACELAND DINING ROOM - LATER

PAN off the chandelier to find STAFF clearing away the
last of the plates at the meal's end. It's a warm
atmosphere and spirits are high. Elvis' end of the table
is abuzz with talk of the new album:

                        JERRY
          You know E, I love the new song,
          man it's--

                        ELVIS
               (interrupting)
          It's unlike anything I've ever
          sung before.

                        PRISCILLA
          The first time Elvis played it for
          me, I cried.

                         CHARLIE
          I don't know about the title: "In
          The Ghetto"...

                        DEE
          "In The Ghetto?" That's going to
          put a lot of people off.

                        CHARLIE
          Well it's a great song but, you
          know, it might...

                        JERRY
          Have you settled on a name for the
          album?

                        ELVIS
          From Elvis... in Memphis. Going
          back to my roots recording here in
          my home town. And then we take it
          to the world with our new wings.

Priscilla summons the maid who brings a tray of jewelry
boxes with a tag reading: "From Elvis." She hands them
out around the table.

                        PRISCILLA
          And in honor of that, Elvis and I
          have organized a little surprise.
          It's nothing crazy.

                        ELVIS
          To celebrate this new chapter, the
          new album, and the tour.

CONTINUED:

Vernon, now a few drinks past his limit, attempts an
aside to Dee.

                           VERNON
             And if the tour doesn't go off as
             planned, those costs, the
             musicians, that airplane, that's
             gonna be on my head, yeah.

A tense silence, as if Colonel's presence is suddenly
felt.

                           HULETT
             Mr Presley, with all due respect,
             man, there's no way this tour
             won't bring in mucho dinero.

                           VERNON
             Well son, I'm sorry, but it's my
             job to worry about these finances
             because I am business manager.

                           PRISCILLA
             Vernon, we're all taking care of
             business now.

Hulett opens one of the boxes, holding up a lightning
bolt necklace, emblazoned with "TCB".

                           ELVIS
             That's right. We're gonna TCB
             around the world... but that don't
             mean nothin' without a little
             tender loving care at home.

One of the women at the table opens her box to find a
matching "TLC" necklace inside.

                           PRISCILLA
             You can't have one without the
             other.

                           ELVIS
             To TCB and TLC.

Glasses are raised as the guests respond, some trying on
their new necklaces with a laugh. Vernon looks on
incredulously.

                           VERNON
                  (to Dee)
             And how much did these cost?

Priscilla looks to Elvis, catching a flicker of self-
doubt.
                                                    126.


EXT. GRACELAND - DAY

An RCA MOBILE RECORDING VAN is parked in the driveway. We
FOLLOW cables running from the van to inside the house.


INT. GRACELAND - JUNGLE ROOM - DAY

Elvis, backup singers, and band are recording. Priscilla
descends the stairs and watches.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Well, the world turns
          And a hungry little boy with a
             runny nose
          Plays in the street as the cold
             wind blows
          In the ghetto
          And his hunger burns
          So he starts to roam the streets
             at night
          And he learns how to steal, and he
             learns how to fight
          In the ghetto


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

The SCREEN FILLS with archival images of riots in
Chicago, Newark...

                         ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          Then one night in desperation
          A young man breaks away
          He buys a gun, steals a car
          Tries to run, but he don't get far
          And his mama cries
          As a crowd gathers 'round an angry
             young man
          Face down on the street with a gun
             in his hand
          In the ghetto


INT. GRACELAND - JUNGLE ROOM - DAY (1969)

Charlie answers the phone and mouths to Jerry, `It's the
Colonel.' Priscilla shakes her head at Charlie. Elvis
imbues the last lines with authentic emotion.

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          And as her young man dies

             Another little baby child is born
             In the ghetto
             And his mama cries


INT. ALADDIN CASINO (VEGAS) - GAMBLING FLOOR - DAY

The CROUPIER deals a card and Colonel taps the table,
requesting another.

                           COLONEL
             Hit me.

But to his surprise, the Croupier does not deal him
another card. Colonel taps the table again.

                           COLONEL
             Hit me.

                           CROUPIER
                  (nervously)
             Mr. Parker, Mr. Kohn would like to
             see you.

                           COLONEL
             Colonel Parker. Hit me.

The Croupier just stares back while the FLOOR MANAGER
beside him shakes his head. Colonel drags himself from
the table, taking a basket of fried chicken with him.


INT. CASINO - MEYER KOHN'S OFFICE

MEYER KOHN and his INTIMIDATING ASSOCIATE stare the
Colonel down from across a desk.

                           MEYER KOHN
             You've run up quite a tab,
             Colonel, and now we hear your boy
             is working with new people. You've
             lost your meal ticket.

Kohn rises for emphasis.

                           MEYER KOHN
             You better settle up, Colonel,
             before we have to make things...

With an ominous knuckle-crack, Kohn's Associate finishes
his sentence.

                           INTIMIDATING ASSOCIATE
             ...Uncomfortable.
                                                    128.


INT. GRACELAND - ELVIS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Elvis brushes his teeth while Priscilla brushes her hair,
getting ready for bed.

                        ELVIS
          I have to see him in Vegas. He's
          hurt his back...

                        PRISCILLA
          Satnin', you know what he's like.
          The moment you get near him, he'll
          have you under 10 feet of snow
          before you know what's happened.

Elvis looks to her, knows where she's going.

                        ELVIS
          Baby my mind's made up. Business
          is business, but I owe it to him
          to tell him to his face.

                        PRISCILLA
          Just be careful he doesn't clip
          your wings.

Elvis slides into the bed, cuddling her.

                        ELVIS
          He won't. I'm gonna go see him in
          Vegas, look him in he eyes and
          tell him it's over.

                        PRISCILLA
          I actually feel sorry for him.

                        ELVIS
          Me too.

We can tell by the way Elvis gently nods that his
feelings for the Colonel still run deep. Priscilla clicks
off the TV remote and we go to black.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

Colonel's eyes bulge, a dismissive smile as he intones...

                        OLD COLONEL
          Sorry for me? She feels sorry for
          me?

Colonel, IV in tow, walks into the model of the European
village we saw in the Christmas special.

A YOUNG WOMAN's laughter echoes from a shopfront.

             Andreas, I feel so sorry for
             you...

This strange memory clearly pains the Colonel.

                            OLD COLONEL
             Sorry for me? For leaving me, Mr.
             Presley? Well, we both had bills
             to pay, but...

He lifts a finger TOWARDS the CAMERA.

                           OLD COLONEL
             I had the perfect solution.


INT./EXT. LIMO/LAS VEGAS STRIP - DAY (1969)

Elvis and Memphis Mafia are driven past garish marquees:
"The Stardust," "Caesars Palace," "The Flamingo."


INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

The West cousins secure the hallway as Elvis approaches
Colonel's room. Diskin guides Elvis through the door.

                           DISKIN
             Hey EP, he doesn't want you making
             a fuss.


INT. HOSPITAL - ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Blinds drawn. A disturbing wheezing. Nurse Tish tends to
Colonel, in a hospital bed. A weak, husky voice...

                           NURSE TISH
             Colonel, Elvis is here.

                           COLONEL
             My boy...

Colonel feebly waves in Elvis' direction.

                           ELVIS
             Admiral... How are you?

Elvis moves to him, concern hidden behind tinted glasses.

                           COLONEL
             I should have gone down to see you
             but as you can see I'm a... little
             laid up, you know.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

He moves to get out of bed, Diskin rushes to support him.

                           NURSE TISH
             You've just had a heart attack;
             you're not to get out of bed.

                           ELVIS
             A heart attack? You said your
             back.

But Colonel is already out of bed, Nurse Tish stabilizing
him with his walker.

                           COLONEL
             Stop making such a fuss. Diskin,
             get the lights. My heart just
             stopped is all... I fell and put
             my back out. It was just all the
             excitement over your Christmas
             special; but I shouldn't have
             worried any.

He stops and looks Elvis directly in the eye.

                           COLONEL
             You came through as you always do.
             I may have very small ideas, but
             no one can sell a show to an
             audience like you can. I admit it,
             I was wrong.

It's almost as if there's an invisible tear in Colonel's
eye. Elvis strengthens his resolve.

                           ELVIS
             Colonel, I want to tell you in
             person. As far as business is
             concerned, I think we need to go
             our separate ways.

But Colonel is all enthusiasm.

                           COLONEL
             Well, you may be right. It may be
             time for me to retire.

Elvis chuckles.

                           ELVIS
             Come on Colonel, quit snowing me.
             You ain't retiring.

The Colonel seems hurt.



                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                                       131.

                        COLONEL
          I will miss the circus. I can't
          keep up with this young fella
          Hulett is putting on your new
          show, an international tour in
          stadiums and the Olympia in Paris
          and the Sydney Opera House and
          what's that one Diskin? "Boukin?"

                        DISKIN
          The Budokan in Tokyo.

                        COLONEL
          The Budokan in Tokyo... But
          creating a show worthy of an
          international tour is very, very
          expensive. All those costs eat
          into the artist's profits and I
          worry that the financial risk
          would put a strain on your father.
          I've been thinking, as your former
          technical advisor and as an old
          friend...

The Colonel looks to Elvis, looking for reassurance.

                        COLONEL
          What if your show didn't cost a
          single cent? Then it would be all
          profit! Every dollar you make
          would be a dollar profit! And I
          think your daddy would like the
          sound of that very much.

Colonel touches a button and the drapes rush back to
REVEAL: the International Hotel, vaulting skywards!


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - LATER

A late-`60s red-and-white extravaganza. Colonel at one
end of the auditorium. Nurse Tish by his wheelchair.
Elvis examines the cavernous stage.

                        ELVIS
          It's a mighty big stage. Remember
          when we saw itty bitty Barbara
          Streisand? It ate her alive.

                        COLONEL
          She worked out the bugs for us.

Colonel dismisses Nurse Tish and walks toward Elvis as he
examines the Versailles-like ceiling.


                                               (CONTINUED)

                           ELVIS
             You can get lost in a place like
             this.

Colonel has now arrived at the front of the stage.

                           COLONEL
             When you started performing, you
             always said something was wrong.
             Your hair, your costume. But you
             was just afraid. Afraid of being
             Elvis, and if you weren't, you
             wouldn't be a great artist.

Elvis considers. He knows there's a truth here.

                           COLONEL
             Now yours and Mr Hulett's
             international tour can't be
             nothing less than great. Nothing
             less than Elvis Presley.

                           ELVIS
                  (tentative)
             I've been experimenting with a
             new, big sound.

Colonel waves his cane towards the stage.

                            COLONEL
             You can fill this stage with every
             musical idea inside...
                  (feigns tapping
                   Elvis' head)
             ... that head.

                              ELVIS
             It would cost.

Colonel leans into Elvis. There's an intimacy in their
closeness in this vast space:

                           COLONEL
             Yes! That's the beauty of it.
             This here International Hotel
             needs a mighty big draw card to
             bring in the boobs... So they will
             cover the costs of putting
             together that show of yours. You
             play here for six weeks and then,
             off you go! Touring around the
             world! With no financial risk to
             Elvis Presley Enterprises. None.



                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                                    133.
CONTINUED: (2)

With this, the Colonel TAPS his cane, adopting that
strange, internal stare, drawing Elvis in for what feels
as though it could be a moment of hypnotism.

Elvis breaks the moment with a laugh.

                        ELVIS
          God damn... The snowman strikes
          again.

                        COLONEL
          We are going to make it snow!
          There will be so much snow, we'll
          be able to ski down the Vegas
          Strip.

                        ELVIS
          So much snow, we'll be able to ski
          off the top of the International!

                        COLONEL
          So much snow, there'll no longer
          be a desert! And you'll take this
          show and ski around the entire
          world! All the way straight to the
          Rock of Eternity!

They laugh. Then, Elvis' mind racing with creativity:


                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Bright light city gonna set my
          soul, gonna set my soul on fire.

                        ELVIS
          We're gonna need the Sweet
          Inspirations!

FOLLOW Elvis' gaze and the famed soul sisters appear.

                        COLONEL
          Done!

                        ELVIS
          And the great Imperials.

                        COLONEL
          Of course!

                        ELVIS
          ... and a 30-piece orchestra!

                        COLONEL
          Strings, brass, a hundred pieces!

          And buttons, pins, calendars,
          posters, photographs, scarves,
          hound dogs. Giant stuffed hound
          dogs. The biggest stuffed hound
          dog on the planet earth.

Full brass section, rhythm, percussion, and male choir
appear alongside the Sweet Inspirations. Colonel, gone.

We are in a full-blown rehearsal. Elvis on a stool at the
center is trim, tanned, and terrific, mic in hand.

                        ELVIS
          You know, the first thing I ever
          recorded, the very first thing,
          was "That's All Right Lil Mama"
          but it was back in 1927, I think
          it was. Let's see. I was quite
          young, but we only had two or
          three instruments at the time. We
          had a guitar, a bass, and another
          guitar. And well, now...

He whistles.

                        ELVIS
          We're gonna make something new
          here... Listen, I want to try
          something. Glenn, why don't you
          take the intro? 2, 3, 4...

Piano starts.

                        ELVIS
          Alright, bring that bass up Jerry.

Bass joins.


EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - DAY

Colonel, Diskin at his side, watches as a crane places a
GIANT, GLITTERING "ELVIS!" MARQUEE.

He turns to gangster GOOCHERA and businessman MEYER KOHN.

                        COLONEL
          If you don't sell any tickets,
          don't blame me none; even the
          gophers in the desert will know
          about this show!

               (sing)
          Any way you do!

He turns to the Memphis Mafia.

                        ELVIS
          What are you looking at back
          there?

He takes a sip of water, then throws the rest at the
Mafia. He turns around and sees Charlie Hodge bugging
James Burton.

                        ELVIS
          Hey Charlie, get back, he ain't
          gonna teach you the guitar in five
          minutes.

INT./EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - DAY

As rehearsal builds, INTERSPERSE SNAPSHOTS of Colonel's
marketing madness: hats, bunting, billboards. Radio ads
simply repeating, "Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!"

Colonel oversees the installation of an endless army of
GIANT, STUFFED HOUND DOGS!

                        COLONEL
          They need to be bigger!


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - LATER

Diskin presents Colonel with a bigger hound dog.

                        COLONEL
          Still not big enough. Go bigger!


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - DAY

                           ELVIS
          Up the octave!

They up the octave. Trumpets wail... As music builds,
Elvis throws in karate moves, experimenting with his
unique style of movement.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - FOYER - DAY

Just when we think the hound dogs can't get any bigger...
Colonel stands in front of: "WORLD'S BIGGEST HOUND DOG!"


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - DAY

Rehearsal reaches new, dizzying peaks.

                        ELVIS
          Bones, give me something strong on
          the one.

Trombones join. Elvis walks over to RONNIE TUTT.

                        ELVIS
          Alright, take it home, brother. Do
          it to me. Come on.

Drums go wild. Elvis wiggles in rhythm, as Ron Tutt's
thunderous drum solo from outer space begins...
                                                      137.


EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - NIGHT

THE "ELVIS!" MARQUEE. Rich and famous alight from limos.
MERCHANDISE SELLERS hawk to CROWDS.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

The drum solo, LOUDER and LOUDER.   MASSIVE BRASS CHORDS.

Elvis and his entourage walk around the back of the
stage, he tunes his guitar. Elvis takes a moment,
summoning all his strength.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT

To deafening applause, the ornate showroom explodes into
a million flashbulbs as Elvis takes the stage and
launches into a super-fast up-tempo vocal:

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Well, that's all right, mama,
          That's alright for you,
          That's alright, mama, any way you
             do...

In one booth, Colonel sits with stoic Goochera and Meyer
Kohn. In another, Priscilla, next to a proud Vernon and
Dee.


INT. JUKE JOINT - NIGHT (1947)

The juke joint's on fire to Arthur Crudup, leaving no
doubt as to the influence on Elvis on stage.

                        BIG BOY CRUDUP
               (sings)
          Well, my mama, she done told me,

             You won't be bothered with me
                round your house no more.

Young Elvis mouths the words.

The three performers across time now appear in a `70s-

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             He put everything he knew about
             music into that show.

Elvis banters with the audience between numbers.

                           COLONEL
             Ain't nobody gonna do a better
             show than that! If I was you, I'd
             book him for the next hundred
             years!

                           KOHN
             Well, no better time than the
             present.

                           GOOCHERA
             We'd like to make him part of the
             family, Colonel.

There is something chilling beneath Goochera's bonhomie.

                           COLONEL
             Well, I think Mr. Presley could be
             persuaded to make the
             International his home...

Suddenly, Elvis calls for a spotlight on Colonel.
Colonel waves to the audience, and with the spotlight
still on him, he says out of the side of his mouth:

                           COLONEL
             Providing of course, he was paid
             pretty well.

                           KOHN
             What did you have in mind?

Colonel takes out his pen with a flourish as Elvis moves
into "Suspicious Minds."

             Why can't you see
             What you're doing to me
             When you don't believe a word I
                say?

                           COLONEL
             Well, for an attraction as
             tremendous as Mr Presley...

          I couldn't let him leave. I had to

...1969 - 1970 - 1971 - 1972 - 1973 = $5,000,000 PLUS
$100,000 SIGNING BONUS."

                        COLONEL
          That's what my boy would expect.

Colonel presents the pen to Kohn who considers, signs the
tablecloth, and hands the pen back.

                        COLONEL
          Now what are you going to pay me?

                        KOHN
          If there's one thing I've learned,
          it's never bet against the
          Colonel. Your sideshow is the
          jackpot.

Kohn can't help admire the Colonel's unfailing chutzpah
as he scribbles on a COCKTAIL NAPKIN, shows it to
Goochera, who nods, and then slides it over to Colonel...

It reads, "THE UNDERSIGNED, COLONEL TOM PARKER, IS A
'SPECIAL GUEST' OF THE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL. HE HAS
UNLIMITED CREDIT AT ALL TABLES."

Colonel signs the napkin and snatches it up, before
easing himself out of the booth.

                        COLONEL
          Oh, and of course I'll reserve the
          right to sell calendars, pictures
          and such on the side.

Kohn rolls his eyes, and nods.

Colonel crocodiles through the audience, eyes locked on
Elvis' incredible performance. Entering the wings, he
sees Jerry between vaulting curtains, staring at the
apparition of Elvis. Colonel places a hand on Jerry's
shoulder and he turns around.

                        JERRY
          Elvis really wants to announce
          tonight.

The Colonel peers at Jerry and raises a finger.

                        COLONEL
          An announcement?

                        JERRY
          The tour, at the press conference.
          He's gonna set E.P. up with his
          own plane.

                        COLONEL
          Or perhaps a rocket ship?

Jerry half-laughs at Colonel's strange joke. Without
taking his eyes off Elvis, Colonel leans in:

                        COLONEL
          Just one thing. Keep in mind...
          security. Security.

                        JERRY
          Hulett knows what he's doing.

Colonel fades back to join Diskin at the legs of the
proscenium, the red floor lights flickering on them both.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          We're caught in a trap
          I can't walk out
          Because I love you too much, baby

Colonel halts abruptly, cane before his eyes, staring
inward. Suddenly, intense:

                        COLONEL
          Diskin, have we discussed with Mr.
          Hulett? Pertaining to the death
          threats?

                           DISKIN
               (unsure)
          Death threats?

Colonel unconsciously taps his cane, deep in thought.

                        COLONEL
               (mouthing the words)
          Death threats...
                                                       142.


FLASH FORWARD INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS' ROOM -
NIGHT

A door cracks ajar to reveal a Showroom menu on the floor
outside. The photo of Elvis' face is scratched out.
Scrawled across it: "I am going to kill you."

END FLASH FORWARD.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT

Back in the present, Elvis has the audience spellbound,
as he repeats the final verse over and over...

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          We're caught in a trap
          I can't walk out
          Because I love you too much, baby

A tap from the Colonel's cane sends us into a stylized,
operatic bubble of Suspicious Minds.


FLASH FORWARD INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT

Elvis, in a different jumpsuit, is performing   `Never Been
to Spain.' FOUR MEN charge the stage, sending   Elvis to
one knee, reaching for a holster in his boot.   The Memphis
Mafia rush to stop him, dragging him from the   stage.

The crowd applauds, thinking it is part of the show,
until Elvis returns.

                        ELVIS
          I'm sorry ladies and gentleman.
          I'm sorry I didn't break his
          goddam neck! If he wants to shake
          my hand I'm fine, if he wants to
          get tough I'll whoop his ass...

Elvis charges into `Polk Salad Annie.'

END FLASH FORWARD.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT

The audience cheers Elvis, as Suspicious Minds reaches
its thundering climax. As the stage lights drop to black,
the reaction is rapturous.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          That night he went from a man, to
          a god...

CONTINUED:

From his vantage point by the stage, Colonel looks over
to Priscilla, sat with Vernon and his new wife, Dee.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             She had never seen him perform
             live, and in her face I saw a
             familiar expression. The same fear
             I had seen in the face of his
             mother. The realization that he no
             longer belonged to her...

Dee turns to Pricilla, almost yelling amidst the fervor.

                           DEE
             You must see this all the time!

But a clearly astonished Priscilla is slow to respond, a
thought dawning on her.

                           PRISCILLA
             Never...

                           DEE
             Never what?

                           PRISCILLA
             I've never seen him perform a live
             show before.

                            DEE
             You're the lucky one, you get to
             take him home!


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             Yes, he was once again Elvis,
             making love to a live audience.

More cheers.

                            ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Wise men say, only fools rush
                in...
             But I can't help falling in love
                with you...
             Shall I stay?
             Would it be a sin...
             If I can't help falling in love
                with you?

CONTINUED:

The Colonel has moved back into the auditorium. Leaning
down from the stage to kiss a woman in the audience,
Elvis looks up and connects with Colonel. They share a
smile; once again great together.

Elvis unexpectedly walks down into the audience, as if
offering himself as sacrifice. Colonel directs security
to throw an instant ring around Elvis.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             That's what was great about Elvis.
             He'd get an idea and take it to
             the rock of eternity...

Placing his hands on Elvis' waist, the Colonel guides
Elvis through the melée and an orgy of kisses.

Colonel shares a look with Priscilla.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             In this, his greatest moment, she
             could see the nature of his love.
             A love that we mere mortals could
             only glimpse from the shadows.

Gifting Elvis back to his audience, Colonel saunters back
through the showroom in a victory lap.

                            ELVIS
                  (sings)
             For I can't help falling in love
                with you...

The enormous golden curtain falls. The crowd rises in
unrestrained adoration, while Jerry guides Priscilla,
Vernon, and Dee backstage.

                           JERRY
             He did it! Next stop: the world!

Priscilla manages an insecure smile.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Behind the curtain, the Memphis Mafia gather around and
swathe Elvis in towels, moving him towards Jerry,
Priscilla, Vernon, and Dee. The Colonel looks on from the
shadows on the other side of the stage. Priscilla
unabashedly throws her arms around Elvis.

                           PRISCILLA
             I don't know who that was out
             there, but I sure am glad I'm
             married to him.

Elvis looks up and can see his father, proud and beaming.
Vernon's warm and steady hands clasp his.

                           VERNON
             Son, Mama was looking down on you,
             clapping and celebrating with all
             of us.

                           DEE
             Oh, you were wonderful! Do you
             mind signing these for my boys?

But Elvis is staring towards the Colonel, isolated,
alone. Priscilla, sensitive to this:

                           PRISCILLA
             Mr Presley... I see that's your
             new manager over there.

With this, she and Jerry guide Vernon and Dee away.

                           PRISCILLA
             We'll see you at the party.

But Elvis has already begun to cross the stage.

                           COLONEL
             Tremendous triumph, greatest show
             on earth! My dear boy, this
             brainchild came from you and me.
             But you above it all made it work
             with your talent and dedication.
             We did it, my boy. We did it.

                           ELVIS
             We did it. I can't wait to show
             the world what you and I can do.

Colonel's eyes drift towards the napkin gripped in his
hand. Like Judas clutching 30 pieces of silver...

                           COLONEL
             Yes, the world will see your show.
             I guarantee it. Whatever I have to
             do I will carry it out... Whatever
             it takes.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             ... As long as they bought a
             ticket to Vegas.

             Thank you. Thank you very much.
             Gentlemen, how are ya? Would you

Laughter from the reporters. Elvis sits down.

             embarrassed myself, man. Uh I
             don't know dear. I just enjoy the

          Elvis, what finally made you come
          out of seclusion and decide to
          make personal appearances again?

                        ELVIS
          I just missed it. I missed the
          closeness of an audience, of a
          live audience. So just as soon as
          I got out of the movie contracts,
          I started to do live performances
          again.

                        REPORTER
          Will you be continuing to do more
          live work in the future?

          I think so. There's so many places
          I haven't been yet. I'd like to go
          to Europe, I'd like to go to Japan
          and all those places. I've never
          been out of the country except in

FLASHES light up a beaming Fats and Elvis.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - COLONEL'S SUITE - MORNING

Hotel staff unload boxes of merchandise onto the table,
as Colonel points to the brick-a-brack displayed
throughout his vast new offices. He turns to Jerry:

                        COLONEL
          I snowed them, I snowed these
          hotel people! Not just for the
          office but the entire floor for
          Jamboree Attractions. We're
          setting up shop.

                        JERRY
               (incredulous)
          But I thought we were going on
          tour in two weeks...

Colonel's face suddenly darkens, as a rage unlike any
other comes upon him. He spits with terrifying vitriol:

                        COLONEL
          Oh, the tour... have you thought
          about security? Have you thought
          about security? Security, Jerry!
          SECURITY, SECURITY. There is
          nothing more important than
          security! Am I the only one who
          ever thinks about Elvis' security!
          `GODVERDOMME'

Furious, Colonel hurls his cane.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS' ROOM - NIGHT

It's late. Still buzzed from that night's show, Elvis
swallows a handful of pills. He cradles the phone against
his ear, speaking softly as he did with Dixie, years ago.

             Little Lisa's so funny. She's
             figured out how to put the records
             on herself and she has a great
             ear. The first one she picked was
             Sweet Caroline. She was trying to
             sing along with it, but she didn't
             know any of the words. It was so
             cute. You should have been there,

             I don't know, `Scilla. There's a
             lot going on. We just added a
             couple extra shows a week, plus
             more press calls. It's a lot. I
             gotta stay focused.


INT. GRACELAND - CONTINUOUS

Priscilla on the other side, crestfallen.

                           PRISCILLA
             I know, baby. Just promise me
             things'll be different when we're
             on the tour.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The silence hangs in the air.

                           ELVIS
                  (to Priscilla)
             I-- I gotta go. Will you give my
             baby girl a big hug for me? Okay,
             bye bye.

He hangs up the phone. A woman beside Elvis, DIANE (late
20s), stirs at the noise. She starts to get up.

                           ELVIS
             Hey, stay with me.

Diane sits on the side of the bed.

                             DIANE
             I have to go.

                             ELVIS
             No you don't.

                           DIANE
             I really have to go.

                           ELVIS
             Don't leave me alone. Buntyn needs
             a little extra lovin' tonight.

Diane laughs. But then she sees that he's serious.

                              DIANE
             What?

Elvis sits up. There's a thump upstairs.

                              ELVIS
             What was that?

Fearful paranoia overtakes Elvis' face. Diane starts to
pull on her clothes.

                           ELVIS
                  (to himself)
             I don't want no sonofabitch
             walking around saying he killed
             Elvis Presley...

                           DIANE
             What did you say?

                           ELVIS
             Nothing, baby...

Elvis checks behind the door and finds nothing there. He
regains his fragile composure.

                           ELVIS
             C'mon baby, take your pants off.

                           DIANE
             I have to go to work.

                           ELVIS
             No you don't, come sit down. Come
             watch some television with me.

Diane starts to leave. Elvis' words begin to slur as the
pills take effect.

                           ELVIS
             You know, there's a kind of bird I
             read about somewhere, that don't
             have any legs... so it can't land
             on nothin'.

Diane doesn't know what to do.

          It lives its whole life on the
          wing, and when it gets tired, it
          just spreads its wings and goes to
          sleep on the wind, and if it ever
          does land, even but one time,
          that's when it dies. I just gotta
          keep flying round and round.
               (sings)
          I'll fly away, oh glory
          I'll fly away
          When I die...

Elvis looks to Diane.

                        ELVIS
          Hey, you want to fly away with me?

                          DIANE
          I need to go.

                          ELVIS
          Please stay.

But Diane grabs her shoes and exits. Elvis looks around
the room, scared. There's a KNOCK on his door.

                        ELVIS
          I knew you'd come back.

No answer. He takes his gun, walks over to the door,
peers through the hole. An empty hall. He opens the door.
There's a showroom menu on the ground.

The photo of his face has been scratched out. Scrawled
across it: "I am going to kill you."


EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - DAWN

OFF the vaulting International Hotel marquee shimmering
in the golden light. Workmen lower the "ELVIS!" sign.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          He gave his all to the show, but
          the threats on his life had left
          him paranoid and exhausted.


INT. HOSPITAL (VEGAS) - DAY

Billy covers the windows with tin foil as we TRACK ACROSS
a Polaroid of Lisa Marie, holding a finger painting that

             What is happening to law and
             order! These radical hippies are
             threatening and killing popular
             entertainers...

The Colonel slaps down newspaper articles about the
Manson Family slaying of Sharon Tate.

                           COLONEL
             Hulett's security is not what it
             needs to be and he knows it. An
             international tour is out of the
             question!

Elvis lies in the bed. Priscilla, Vernon, and Charlie
around him.

                           ELVIS
             What are you talking about
             Colonel? I ain't gonna let any
             sonofabitch push me off the stage.

He takes a handful of pills from Dr. Nick.

                           COLONEL
             Precisely, you're not one of
             Hulett's long-hair Zeppelins,
             you're Elvis Presley! And you are
             beloved. I told him: `I need to
             look Priscilla in the eye and
             promise her that little Lisa's
             daddy will be safe.'

                           ELVIS
             We gotta take this show to the
             world. I can't disappoint the
             fans.

                           COLONEL
             Well, if you want to book more
             dates, we can do an American tour?
             15-cities-in-15-days.

                           PRISCILLA
             How's that going to be any safer?

                           COLONEL
             Because here, I can handle every
             aspect of security.

A darkly orchestral version of "Burning Love" slowly
builds...

Elvis' jet taxis to a halt.   "Burning Love" builds...

          We'll double the police
          presence...


EXT. STREETS - DAY

A presidential-scale motorcade. Dozens of police cars,
sirens blaring. "Burning Love" continues.


EXT. VENUE - STAGE - NIGHT

                        COLONEL (V.O.)
          You'll have more security than the
          President!

TWO ROWS OF COPS flank the stage. Elvis on stage
performing "Burning Love," jittery as hell.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Lord almighty, I feel my
             temperature rising.
          Higher, higher, it's burning
             through to my soul.
          Girl, girl, girl, you're gonna set
             me on fire...

A girl rushes the stage. The West cousins take her out.
Elvis shoots them a thumbs-up.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          My brain is flaming,
          I don't know which way to go...

Elvis being swooped into a car as "Burning Love" powers.

                        ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Elvis has left the building!

Elvis, squeezed between Memphis Mafia, gulps down pills.
He lies back, as Dr. Nick injects him.


EXT. TARMAC - NIGHT

CLOSE ON the Memphis Mafia as they usher Elvis from his
limousine and up the stairs of his waiting jet.

                        COLONEL (V.O.)
          And when you're on the plane,
          safe, in the air, you'll rest...


INT. HOSPITAL (VEGAS) - DAY

Elvis slowly nods; so far, he is good with the plan.

                        ELVIS
          And then we go international.

                        COLONEL
          Yes, yes, the Tokyo Opera House!
          But before that we'll put on a
          good show.
               (to Charlie)
          And do what, Charlie?

                        CHARLIE
          Have a lot of fun.

Elvis performs karate against phantom attackers. The
number becomes more intense. We see Elvis performing,
practicing karate, bedding groupies.

             Just a hunk, a hunk of burning
                love!

"THIRD YEAR"... Drugging, performing, groupies, drugging,
karate. It's clear he's not in the same reality.

We see Elvis change from jumpsuit to jumpsuit after each
refrain, moving forward through concert after concert in
one seamless performance.

The SPLIT SCREEN becomes a wall of TV monitors that
multiply until BANG! BANG! BANG!


INT. GRACELAND - BEDROOM/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON jewelry being placed into a small valise. The
sound wakes Elvis, still in bed, groggy, discombobulated.
Priscilla, agitated, is packing.

                           ELVIS
             What the hell are you doing?

She closes the valise and, without looking up:

                            PRISCILLA
             I'm leaving.

                           ELVS
             What time is it?

                           PRISCILLA
             I wanted to wait for you to wake
             up so we could talk about it, but
             you're never awake and you don't
             like to talk, so I'm leaving.

                           ELVIS
             What do you mean leaving?

Elvis pulls himself out of bed.

                           PRISCILLA
             I'm leaving this marriage, and I'm
             taking Lisa with me.

Suddenly alarmed and defensive, Elvis follows her towards
the en suite bath.

                  (looks for the right
                   word)
             What happens on the road? You know
             that means nothing to me.

He follows as Priscilla grabs her makeup off the vanity.

                           PRISCILLA
             You think I care about the girls
             you sneak in through the side
             door?

She stops, looks down at the myriad bottles of
medication. She starts throwing them at Elvis.

                           PRISCILLA
             It's this... and this, and this,
             and this. And those has-been
             leeches sucking you dry. You're
             strung out!

                           ELVIS
             Strung out? It's my medicine. I'm
             in the best shape of my life!

                           PRISCILLA
             The best shape of your life? The
             only time you're alive is when
             you're on stage and in between,
             you're a ghost. We can't keep
             waiting around for you like one of
             your boys.

She heads into the hall, as Elvis chases after her.

                           ELVIS
             I've given you everything you
             could want!


INT. GRACELAND - HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

As Priscilla descends the stairs, she turns on Elvis.

                           PRISCILLA
             What I want is a husband. I am
             your wife. I am your wife. Lisa is
             your daughter, and she needs a
             father. You know, I don't remember
             the last time that we laughed
             together. When was the last time
             we sat down and had dinner
             together the three of us?

             You don't even make love to me
             anymore. I've given you my life. I
             have nothing left to give you.

This cuts deep, silencing Elvis.

                           ELVIS
             Is there another man?

Priscilla says nothing.       But her silence says everything.

                              ELVIS
             I've lost you.

She stops, shakes her head.

                           PRISCILLA
             We lost you a long time ago.

                           ELVIS
             `Scilla, do you still love me?

When she doesn't answer, Elvis crumples on the stairs.

                           ELVIS
             When you're forty and I'm fifty,
             we'll be back together. You'll
             see.

After a moment, both their defenses are down. She throws
her arms around him. They cling to each other, crying.

                           PRISCILLA
             I have to go. If I stay now, I'll
             never leave.

And with this, she's gone.

             This is killing him! Vegas, the
             repetition. He needs to be on a
             professionally-run international
             tour. He needs time to rest
             between shows, not rely on some
             doctor to get him on stage every
             night. You know what Elvis is like
             when he has a challenge. He gets
             fit, focused, gets off the pills.

             That's bullshit! The Colonels' a
             businessman, I get it, but what I
             don't get is why he's killing his
             greatest asset without a reason.
             So, what's the reason?

Diskin retreats behind his trademark bland expression.

                           DISKIN
             I'm a little busy right now.

Reining in anger, Jerry leans forward, trying to connect.

             And I've seen you, standing in the
             wings when he's channeling that
             gift. You think no one's watching,
             but it's the only time I ever see
             you smile; you love him as much as
             the rest of us.

Diskin, for a moment, can't look at Jerry.

                           JERRY
             Tell me the reason.

                           DISKIN
                  (choosing words
                   carefully)
             Colonel always has reasons. I'm
             not always aware of them, but even
             if I was, I wouldn't be at liberty
             to divulge personal information
             about Mr. Parker.

A long moment. Jerry looks at him with cold, hard hatred.

                           JERRY
             Y'all are killing Elvis Presley.

He rises to leave...


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - JERRY'S ROOM - NIGHT

It's obviously the end of a long night. Jerry, coat off,
looking exhausted, enters his room.

                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                                       159.
CONTINUED:

He turns on the light and stops. On the bed, a single
envelope. He picks it up. It's addressed to "Colonel Tom
Parker, Elvis Presley Fan Club, Memphis." It's been
stamped "Fan Mail," and has already been opened.

Jerry takes out the letter and, as he begins to read, we
hear the sound of a young man speaking in lightly
accented English:

                           THEO JR. (V.O.)
             Dearest Uncle Andreas, I hope this
             letter finds you well. I did not
             have an exact address, but after
             reading the letter you sent to my
             father, I felt that I must ask you
             some questions. You write of
             mistakes, `that someone may have
             made without meaning to do so.'
             Are these `mistakes' the reason
             you left Holland all those years
             ago?


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

As we continue to hear the letter, Colonel walks into the
life-sized model of BREDA, as if reliving the past.

                           THEO JR. (V.O.)
             People whisper that it was because
             of the woman who was murdered the
             night you disappeared. I do not
             believe it, but please, why do you
             not return home to clear our
             family name...?

                           OLD COLONEL
                  (directly to us)
             Is it fair that the mistake that
             someone might have made without
             meaning to do so, should damn them
             for the rest of their lives? Yes,
             I was born in Holland. People say
             `well why didn't you say so?' Well
             I say they didn't ask. I work, I
             wake up at five A.M. every day for
             one man only. I am taking care of
             business.


INT. INTERNATIONAL - SERVICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT (1974)

An exhausted and slightly discombobulated Elvis, guided
by the Memphis Mafia, makes his way down the backstage
corridor of the International Hotel.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Jerry has drawn in behind. As they move forward he
urgently intones under his breath.

                           JERRY
             He lied! There was never gonna be
             an international tour because he
             can't leave the country. He
             doesn't have a passport, no
             citizenship, no identity...

Elvis stops, unsteady, trying to comprehend.

                           JERRY (CONT'D)
             He doesn't exist...

                           ELVIS
             What the hell are you talking
             about, Jerry?

                           JERRY
             There never was a Colonel Tom
             Parker.

Before Jerry can get out the last line, Elvis collapses
to the ground. The mafia rush to his aid. Sonny and Red
hold staff at bay.

                           COLONEL (O.S.)
             The only thing that matters is
             that that man...

As Colonel charges in, Nurse Tish suppresses panic and
Dr. Nick holds Elvis' head above a bucket of ice water.

                           COLONEL (CONT'D)
             ... gets on that stage tonight!

This is the exact IMAGE FROM THE OPENING.

                           NURSE TISH
             If he was my son...

She glances to Vernon hiding meekly by the window.

                           NURSE TISH
             I'd put him in the hospital.

Colonel's eyes bore into Elvis' father.

                           COLONEL
             Of course, it's a Presley
             Enterprises decision, Vernon...

All eyes on him.    After an eternity, he mumbles...

                        VERNON
          What can you do for him, Dr. Nick?

Dr. Nick pops open his BAG OF TRICKS. WE GLIMPSE: MEDS,
PILLS, SYRINGES. As Dr. Nick prepares an injection...


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT

AN AMERICAN EAGLE CAPE SPREADS ITS RHINESTONE WINGS!

                         ELVIS
          Glory!   Glory!!! Halleluuuujah!!!

The eagle turns to REVEAL: Superhero Elvis reaching for
the final divine notes, spreading his wings up to God...

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          His truuuuth is maaaarching
          ooooonnnnn!!!!!!!!

The ballad crescendoes, band lashing at their
instruments, two gospel choirs, one white, one Black.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          His truuuuth is maaaarching
          ooooonnnnn!!!!!!!!

The last cymbal crashes, Elvis is showered with applause.

                         ELVIS
          Thank you!   Thank you very much!

Elvis waits for the applause to settle. The music always
transforms him. He may be slightly pale but he holds
himself strong, proud...

                        ELVIS
          I'd like to turn the house lights
          up, ladies and gentlemen. Now
          you've seen me, I'd like to take a
          look at you. You're beautiful...

The lights go up. Charlie Hodge at his usual position on
stage, battle-weary from Elvis' erratic behavior. Jerry,
Billy, and the West cousins in the wings.

                        ELVIS
          Thank you, leave them up for a
          minute, man. Oh, boy, we got some
          high-rollers in here tonight...
          Mr. International Hotel himself!

As the crowd applauds, the SPOTLIGHT searches, finding
Meyer Kohn. Colonel sits beside him.

                           ELVIS
             And right next to him... my so-
             called manager, Colonel Tom
             Parker.

Colonel, puffing on his cigar as Elvis continues with
drug-addled, unnerving humor:

                           ELVIS (O.S.)
             But I hear rumors... that Colonel
             is an alien... from outer space.

The crowd laughs.

                           ELVIS
             Someone call the FBI and tell them
             he's abducted me, locked me in
             this golden cage, to keep me here,
             forever-- with you, ladies and
             gentlemen, and all these funky
             angels on the ceiling...

The crowd applauds.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             So I'm caught in a trap, I can't
             get out...
             `Cause Colonel's got some big
                debts, baby...

Colonel excuses himself from the booth and heads towards
the wings.

                           ELVIS
             But this is the last show I'm ever
             playin' here...

Audience, a collective sigh of disappointment...

                           ELVIS
             I'm gonna get in my jet plane, the
             Lisa Marie, named after my
             beautiful daughter, and fly
             away... Fly, fly away...

Colonel arrives in the wings, next to the stage manager.

                           COLONEL
             Stop the show, stop the show.
                  (to Diskin)
             We've got to do something!

          Get over to Sonny and Red. Bring
          the curtain down!

A strange mix of nervous laughter and confused applause.

                        ELVIS
          Fuck the International! Fuck Las
          Vegas! Ain't no one gonna stop me,
          man!

Colonel approaches Jerry.

                        COLONEL
          What the devil is going on, Mr.
          Schilling?

                        JERRY
          I think that's what he wants to
          know.

Elvis spies Colonel in the wings and mocks him angrily,
microphone still in hand:

                        ELVIS
          Oh, security, security!! 800
          shows!! You don't have a goddamn
          passport, you son of a bitch...

Elvis finds strength to say the words that have eluded
him since he first met Colonel. A gut-wrenching scream:

                           ELVIS
          You're fired!!

The audience continues to laugh and applaud.

                           ELVIS
          Fired!!

The audience laughs louder. Elvis, in a demonic rage:

                           ELVIS
          FIRED!!!

The golden curtain crashes down. All on stage in shock,
as Elvis and Colonel stare at each other. As the applause
dies, the silence seems to last an eternity.

The panicked Memphis Mafia goes into their post- show
routine. Towels appearing, they move towards Elvis. But
he stays them with his hand. Everyone freezes.

Then, as if sanity, clarity, and dignity have re-entered
his soul, Elvis says one final time:

                          ELVIS

He turns, walks across stage, past Jerry, into shadow.

Colonel's eyes are cold as we have ever seen.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          The Geek... The Geek...

Colonel slowly walks back over to Diskin. He shoots
Vernon a grave look.

                        COLONEL
          Diskin, pull out all the contracts
          and agreements since 1955..


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

Old Colonel watches Nightmare Alley. The movie shows an
alcoholic carnival performer sunk so disgracefully low
that he will do anything for a drink.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          ... when he ran, as he always did,
          it was my job to take a bottle and
          bring him back.

PULL OUT to see the movie playing on endless televisions.

                        OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
          The Geek lived in Hell, but every
          night, before the cheering crowd,
          he was resurrected. Perfect.
          Forgiven. Some called it cruelty,
          but I called it kindness. The
          Geek needed to perform... And to
          perform, he needed his bottle.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - COLONEL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

We find ourselves in Colonel's Vegas office. He stands at
his desk in front of the same Snowman's League banner.

               (into telephone)
          This is Colonel Tom Parker. I wish
          it to be known that Dr. Nick's

          Thank you.

He hangs up and turns to Diskin, at a typewriter.

A clean, morning sunlight slashes across the Nevada
desert and into Elvis' suite. Drop cloths over furniture,
gold records removed from the wall. We follow luggage on
a gold bellman's trolley being pushed by Cousin Billy. He
gives a final look over their home of the past few years.

                           BILLY
             E.P. says we need to hurry up.

As Billy exits, the door opens to reveal the ashen face
of Vernon. He enters past Charlie without acknowledgment,
and sets down a letter onto the piano.

Vernon pours himself a drink and stares out blankly over
the desert vista.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - PARKING GARAGE - DAY

An endless stream of luggage is ferried into limousines
in the parking garage. FOLLOW the luggage to find...


INT. ELVIS' LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Elvis in the back of his limo, a little jittery from
withdrawal. But if anything, this energizes him, making
him even more determined to leave, no matter what.

                           ELVIS
             What's the hold-up?

Charlie enters the garage, leans into Elvis' window.

                           CHARLIE
             Sorry, E.P. Your daddy won't come
             down, says he needs to talk...

Elvis exits the car and heads back toward the hotel

             You alright?

Elvis waves him back. OFF Elvis' concerned expression...


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS' ROOM - DAY

Elvis enters the suite and Vernon gestures toward the
letter on the piano. ANGLE ON A "PRESLEY ENTERPRISES"
BALANCE SHEET WITH A BIG TOTAL CIRCLED IN RED:
"$9,800,099."

Vernon is shaking his head, eyes filled with tears.

             You spend so much. The cars, the
             clothes, the girls, the new
             airplane, everything.

             I don't know what to tell you,
             son. We're broke, just plain
             broke...

His eyes raise to meet Elvis.

                           VERNON
             We gotta take Colonel back.

                           ELVIS
             I'm not taking him back.

                           VERNON
             We'll lose Graceland.

                           ELVIS
             He has taken fifty percent of
             everything I make. And now he
             wants to take the house that we
             bought for Mama? The old bastard
             can sue if he wants, but I'm
             flying away, with or without you,
             Daddy...

Elvis storms out of the suite...


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELEVATOR - DAY

The elevator descends. Elvis -- a powder keg of emotions.
He takes deep breaths, reining himself in.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

             I'm gonna fly away, fly, fly
             away... just you watch me...

BING! The elevator halts. The doors open to reveal...


INT. INTERNATIONAL - PARKING GARAGE - DAY

Colonel waiting in the empty concierge area. Beyond the
glass, Elvis can see the waiting cars.

A beat. Is this a set-up? He steps out of the elevator.

                           ELVIS
             You blood-sucking old vampire; you
             bled me dry, but still you want
             more.

                           COLONEL
             I'm not an uncaring man, Mr.
             Presley.

                           ELVIS
             Don't you `Mr. Presley' me, you
             toad.

                           COLONEL
             If you are so determined to get
             out of our contract...

                           ELVIS
             Goddamn right I want out!

                           COLONEL
             Then I will personally loan you
             the money you owe to Jamboree
             Attractions.

                           ELVIS
             Yeah, and you'll still have your
             claws in me. Still have me workin'
             here like a slave in a salt mine,
             you phony, no-good piece of trash.
             Who are you, Colonel from outta
             space?

                           COLONEL
             Colonel from outta space, and
             Captain Marvel Jr. Has a nice ring
             to it, don't you think?

                           ELVIS
             I oughta shoot you in your fat,
             goddamn face...

                           COLONEL
             Remember, you were so ready to fly
             `faster than the speed of light
             straight to the Rock Of Eternity.'

                           ELVIS
                  (intense)
             Who are you?

                           COLONEL
             I, am you. And you, are me.

                           ELVIS
             Cut the horseshit...

                           COLONEL
             Everyone else you're associated
             with lives from you. Even
             Vernon...

Elvis, shocked. The realization dawning.

                           COLONEL
             That's right, even your own daddy
             looks after himself, before he
             looks after you. Yes, I lived from
             you, too. But the difference is
             that you also lived from me. Since
             that first night on that big,
             beautiful wheel, lookin up into
             the moon and the stars, we
             understood that we are the same,
             you and I: we are two odd, lonely
             children, reaching for Eternity.
             And to my way of thinking, we
             traveled beyond our wildest
             dreams. Perhaps you should find
             another manager to replace me.
             But what cannot be replaced is the
             20 years together, more than 20
             years. Someone may promote you
             better, but no one will ever
             understand you better. And if you
             do choose to leave, I for one will
             be very lonely. Very lonely

Colonel makes his way over to the elevator. Elvis,
battling his emotions within. Beyond the glass, the cars
waiting to leave.

                           COLONEL
             But, I think you may be lonely,
             too. You know, my boy, the truth
             about the Rock of Eternity, is
             that it is forever just beyond our
             reach.

CONTINUED: (2)

Elvis looks back to Colonel as the elevator doors close.
We hear the melancholy opening notes of "Are You Lonesome
Tonight":

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          Are you lonesome tonight?
          Do you miss me tonight?
          Are you sorry we drifted apart?


EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SUNSET

VERY WIDE: As "Are You Lonesome Tonight" builds, the
elevator travels up the huge, brutal facade of the hotel.

                         ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          Does your memory stray,
          To a brighter summer day?
          When I kissed you and called you
             sweetheart?


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS' ROOM - SUNSET

As Elvis enters, "Are You Lonesome Tonight" plays.

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          Honey, you lied when you said you
             loved me,
          And I had no cause to doubt you

Elvis stands, staring out the hotel window as the sun
sets over Vegas... The loneliest man in the world.

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          But I'd rather go on hearing your
             lies,
          Than go on, living without you


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - COLONEL'S SUITE - SUNSET

Colonel sits in his suite, staring at the telephone.

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          Is your heart filled with pain?
          Shall I come back again?
                                                       171.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS' ROOM - SUNSET

Elvis sits behind the piano, he plays a few notes and
sings, barely audibly, to himself.

                        ELVIS
               (sings)
          Tell me, dear, are you lonesome
             tonight...

Vernon approaches timidly, just looking at Elvis. A long
moment. Elvis doesn't turn to him, but speaks with
heartbroken disgust:

                        ELVIS
          Daddy, tell that sonofabitch I
          want things to go back to the way
          they were.

As Vernon heads to the door, Elvis gathers up two remote
controls, closing the curtains and clicking on the TVs.

                          ELVIS
          And, Daddy...

Elvis flops down into the sunken lounge.

                        ELVIS
          Tell the Colonel to send up Dr
          Nick.

                        ELVIS (V.O.)
               (vocal)
          Tell me, dear, are you lonesome
             tonight...


EXT. TARMAC - YEARS LATER

Vernon stands outside Elvis' limo, watching as
Priscilla's car pulls up. The Lisa Marie jet nearby,
engines roaring.

Taking Lisa Marie in his arms, Vernon heads towards
Priscilla. Lisa runs to her mommy and after a moment,
Priscilla hands her to a nanny.

Vernon looks to Priscilla as she passes.


INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A knock. Elvis glances up as Priscilla gets in.



                                              (CONTINUED)
                                                       172.
CONTINUED:

After a long, taut silence, Elvis, discombobulated, does
what he always does in moments like this. Without looking
up to Priscilla, he sings under his breath.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             If I should stay I would only be
             in your way
             And so I'll go, but I know I'll
             think of you each step of the way
             And I will...

He stops, unable to complete the line from this now very
famous song.

                           PRISCILLA
             That's beautiful.

                           ELVIS
                  (weakly)
             Dolly Parton wanted me to record
             it.

                           PRISCILLA
             And?

                           ELVIS
                  (unengaged)
             Publishing and what not. It's not
             gonna happen.

She reaches across and touches him gently.

                           PRISCILLA
             How are you doing?

Elvis doesn't respond.

                           PRISCILLA
             Honey, there's this place you can
             go in San Diego where you can
             rest.

Elvis looks up, connecting with her for the first time.

                           PRISCILLA
             Heal. After the show, you can fly
             there directly, and be in the
             clinic before anyone knows. It's
             all been arranged.

                           ELVIS
             `Cilla I'm gonna be forty soon.
             Forty. Forty years old. And people
             are not gonna remember me.

                        ELVIS (CONT'D)
          I've never done anything lasting,
          never made a classic film that I
          can be proud of.

                        PRISCILLA
          What about `A Star is Born'?

                        ELVIS
          Well, you know, Barbara and the
          Colonel...

They laugh together.

                        PRISCILLA
          Please go... For Lisa. Promise me?
          If you dream it, you'll do it.

But Elvis cuts her off:

                        ELVIS
          I'm all out of dreams.

She's done her best. A knock at the door.


EXT. TARMAC - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Elvis gets out of the car, Priscilla gets out on the
opposite side. They're about to part, but instinctively
stop for a moment, looking to each other across the roof.

Elvis' voice is lost to the roar of the engines as he
mouths the final lyric to the song he could not sing: "I
will always love you."

They part, and Elvis heads for the plane as the song
"Separate Ways" begins.


INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)

HIGH CRANE DOWN as Old Colonel wanders into an infinite
row of slot machines...

                        OLD COLONEL
          The day he died...

Colonel settles into a chair at a favorite machine.

                        OLD COLONEL
          First thing I did was pick up that
          phone to the record company, and
          tell `em they'd better print more
          records.

             And at the funeral when everyone
             was crying, I said to his father
             Vernon, `let's get to work.' Do
             you know why? I had to keep him
             traveling endlessly toward the
             Rock of Eternity-- because that's
             what he would have wanted. The
             only relationship to which he was
             forever true, was to you, his
             audience.


INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT (1977)

Elvis performs his final concert.

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             The very last time I saw him sing,
             he could seldom stand...

He's shockingly overweight, heaving for breath, slurring.

                           ELVIS
             This song is uh, I just recorded
             it... I don't know h-h-h-ahhh. Is
             it out?

                           CHARLIE
             About two weeks.

                           ELVIS
             Two weeks it'll be out? `Unchained
             Melody'... from an album called
             Unchained Melody...
                  (jokes)
             Makes a lot of sense...

He sits at the piano, mops his brow. Even though he
hasn't started yet, he yells out to the audience:

                           ELVIS
             How do you like it so far?

Cheers and laughs. Then Elvis' fingers hit the ivories...

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             But without fail, that voice rang
             out!

Elvis' vocal begins to soar:

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             Woah, my love, my darling
             I've hungered for your touch,
             A long lonely time...

IN FLASHBACK WE REVISIT: The beauty and greatness of the
tragic American opera of Elvis' life...

                  (sings)
             And time goes by so slowly
             And time can do so much
             Are you still mine?

                           OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             I didn't kill him. It was love.
             His love for you...

Despite his bloated look and discombobulation, Elvis hits
the high note with impossible vocal beauty and strength.

                           ELVIS
                  (sings)
             I need your love
             I need your love

                            OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
             And yours...

                  (sings)
             ... to me!

Elvis, profusely sweating, manages to smile back one last
time at the wave of adulation and love coming to him from
the audience as he slowly fades into inky BLACKNESS.

                           ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             Elvis has left the building!

BEEEEPPPPP. The sound of a FLATLINE.

                                                 FADE OUT.
