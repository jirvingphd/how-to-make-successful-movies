Jump!\r\n\r\nHorror is one of those genres that creates such voting and reviewing hostility on internet sites. You can guarantee that no matter what new horror film comes out it will garner posts on the likes of IMDb as being \"the worst horror film I have ever seen\". That is until the next big release, where we will go around the houses again... \r\n\r\nOuija is just a standard boo-jump horror picture with a standard story line. Any expectation of any thing more would have (will do) led (lead) to great disappointment. It's one of those horror films that asks you to turn off the lights and just enjoy the quick spooky ride, then you get off the ride and quickly move on to something else. It's neither \"the worst horror film of all time\" or anything remotely original. It's Boo-Jump horror 101, so buy into that or leave it well alone. 6/10", "created_at": "2015-08-24T09:44:10.286Z"}]
