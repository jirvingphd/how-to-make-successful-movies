At one point he happened to turn around in some kind of an installation and immediately got stopped by authorities and apprehended. He was taken to the proverbial dark room with a hanging light where he was interrogated for a couple hours. I asked what he thought was going to happen and he said he feared getting taken to a gulag in Siberia.\r\n\r\nI bring this up because you\u2019ll see these kinds of elements in \"Transsiberian\" (2008), a crime drama/suspense/thriller that has the tone & themes of \u201cA Simple Plan\u201d (1998), but mixed with a little \u201cRunaway Train\u201d (1985) and \u201cDr. Zhivago\u201d (1965). While I still prefer \u201cRunaway Train\u201d I have no problem listing \u201cTranssiberian\u201d with these notable films, despite the fact that it\u2019s an obscure flick that bombed at the box office (no doubt because it wasn\u2019t released properly and didn\u2019t reach enough theaters). \r\n\r\n\u201cTranssiberian\u201d works so well because it has the confidence to take its time and establish the characters, which are nicely fleshed-out. Roy (Harrelson), for instance, is an affable Christian who seems oblivious to the evil in the world and assumes the best in everybody. His wife, Jessie (Mortimer), by contrast, has a dark history, but was obviously attracted to Roy\u2019s innocence. She sees her former-self in Abby (Mara), which links them. Meanwhile Carlos (Noriega) is the worldly bad boy who\u2019s an expert at wooing women.\r\n\r\nBut this is just the set-up, the movie takes a thrilling turn in the last act, but it\u2019s superior to the similar Hollywood turn in \u201cA Simple Plan,\u201d which I found unconvincing and a little eye-rolling.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour and 51 minutes and was shot in Lithuania, Russian and China.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-", "created_at": "2019-05-20T02:24:04.382Z"}, {"movie_id": 6687, "review_id": "6083a1dc56b9f7002930fe18", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Another excellent Woody Harrelson performance.
