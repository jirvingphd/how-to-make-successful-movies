And it's the perfect vehicle for him. Let's face it in almost every movie Statham is just Statham, but that's ok, it's exactly what we want to see. This is basically Luc Besson's version of a Jackie Chan movie. And it really does work. Ok, the BMW bridge jump was nothing short of cringeworthy, but the rest of the movie is enjoyable enough that we can forgive that...just.", "created_at": "2023-06-11T06:10:18.384Z"}]
