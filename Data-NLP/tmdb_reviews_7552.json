Truly, I haven't seen a good comedy from the recent time releases, so I'm happy I saw this, even though it is a decade old. There's no serious negative stuffs in it like drugs, sex or nudity, so I think it is okay for family viewing.\r\n\r\n_7/10_", "created_at": "2016-10-24T17:43:36.796Z"}, {"movie_id": 7552, "review_id": "64656e32006b0100e6b2ba9f", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Interesting movie.
