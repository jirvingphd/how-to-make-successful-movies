Ginsburg is human, I'm sure she had to struggle to over come more than just the evil White Male patriarchy, but even that she effortlessly dismantles.\r\n\r\nHalfway through the movie you expect her to wear a cape and fly away, just to prove she can out super Superman as well.\r\n\r\nIn a Biopic you kind of expect to get to know the character, to see their ups and downs. Instead, however, what you get is a golden god with history rewritten to add a healthy polish.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T03:21:29.653Z"}]
