Has yet another emotion-less \"performance\" from Bruce Willis who spends a good amount of time resting on a bed. The action is pretty inept and dialogue absolutely awful. The best thing is at least Chad Michael Murray was giving what I would call an \"aw f it\" performance. Otherwise this is as just as bland and forgettable as the first movie. **1.5/5**", "created_at": "2022-06-19T16:54:45.529Z"}]
