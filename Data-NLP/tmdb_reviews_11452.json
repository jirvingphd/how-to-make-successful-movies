For a movie that most certainly contains both those two things (the latter in especially heavy doses), I actually didn't mind _Van Wilder_ that much. But it's all about context, if instead of comparing it to a list of similar things that I hate you compared it to, say, the entire history of cinema overall, then _National Lampoon's Van Wilder_ is pretty bad.\r\n\r\nOne additional note, the friend of mine who I put this on for told me that the movie was from the era of \"When Tara Reid was still hot\". Now personally I've never found any iteration of her attractive, but it did make me have a parallel thought, is Van Wilder from the era when Tara Reid was a better actor? I'm not saying she has been some sort of Oscar-worthy great at any stage, but if I compare her in this to her in, for example, _Sharknado 47_, despite the extra years of experience, she's definitely worse now, right?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._", "created_at": "2018-03-18T09:16:42.471Z"}]
