She was betwixt a child and a teenager. And Hall was perhaps between deadlines and going on tours, thus missing out on some of her late childhood/early adolescence (\"I thought they would be small boats... children's boats...\").\r\n\r\nThe vampire kids represent the sometimes startling changes children go through as they enter their teens - e.g. their music and the clothes they wear - as they start developing a disposition of their own. It seems so weird to their parents who unexpectedly discover themselves \"on the outside looking in.\" The Sheriff symbolizes the older generation; basically saying, \"Bah, these kids today!\"\r\n\r\nThe psycho pastor slays the kids to prevent them from \"becoming vampires,\" that is, becoming teenagers who will lose their innocence as they make many mistakes learning to decide for themselves.\r\n\r\nFlamingo is akin to the Pied Piper; he \"gets away\" at the climax because he'll always be around: There will always be a teenage spirit of rebellion, regardless of the clothes it wears.\r\n\r\nIf my comments sound like several dubiously-linking threads its because the movie leaves you with this impression.", "created_at": "2022-05-18T18:02:18.389Z"}, {"movie_id": 78381, "review_id": "640d1a58a6c104007904697b", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "Now re-released as \"B'Twixt Now & Sunrise\" the director's cut is actually a little shorter than the 2011 initial release. \r\n\r\nThis film is a dreamscape with lots of nightmarish, surreal visuals which, unfortunately, are not helped by a flat, cheap, shot-on-digital look (the technology has gotten a lot better since then).\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a lot to like here -- the horror and literary references, plus the cast. And, of course, Francis Ford Coppola movies are worth watching, especially some of the lesser known ones... for example, I liked his 'ageing backward' movie, Youth Without Youth, better than the far more popular Benjamin Button.", "created_at": "2023-03-12T00:18:32.601Z"}]
