Judy Blume\u2019s beloved book has been considered a rite of passage for many young girls, and the pressure of adapting the work for the screen had to be enormous for writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig. Thankfully, the film does the source material justice, creating a timeless coming-of-age story that brings the classic book to life.\r\n\r\nSixth grader Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson) is 11 when she is unexpectedly uprooted from her life in New York City to the suburbs of New Jersey. Her mom Barbara (Rachel McAdams) and dad Herb (Benny Safdie) assure her that she will make new friends and get a fresh start at school. Margaret doesn\u2019t want to move away from her loving grandma (Kathy Bates) either, who constantly reminds the family that she\u2019s unhappy they\u2019ve moved so far away. While her mom has difficulty adjusting to her new role as a homemaker, Margaret is quickly accepted by neighbor Nancy (Elle Graham) into her secret club for girls with fellow classmates Gretchen (Katherine Mallen Kupferer) and Janie (Amari Alexis Price). They meet after school to talk about the important things: boys, getting their periods, and their developing bodies.\r\n\r\nThe film stays mostly true to Blume\u2019s original work, with a few potentially problematic things omitted and others added to build more drama. The novel heavily discusses religion, as Margaret\u2019s mother was raised Christian and her father is Jewish, and the young girl struggles with finding a place where she belongs. Margaret prays to a god, but also asserts that she doesn\u2019t believe in one. The film carries this theme well, and does not shy away from frank discussions about how religion divides people.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of scenes about the ups and downs of puberty, one of the most confusing and taxing time in the life of an adolescent.

In one of her smartest moves in dealing with the screen adaptation, Craig wisely keeps the story set in 1970, just like the original. It lends a heavy dose of nostalgia that takes you back to a time of innocence, an era without iPhones or the internet.
