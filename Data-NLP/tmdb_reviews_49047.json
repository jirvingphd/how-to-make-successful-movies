This is probably a movie that would benefit from being watched in a good theater with its grandiose scenery.\n\nHowever, I have to say that I found the rest of the movie somewhat mediocre. The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr. Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish first being real slow in obeying the order to evacuate and then floating around huffing and puffing, talking a lot when she should really conserve oxygen. Did they not give her the basic course before letting her up in space? I also found it soooo Hollywood that she was able to get onto the Chinese space station and seconds later it starts to descend into the atmosphere. In general I felt that the script writer was not really very technically knowledgeable.\n\nOverlooking these, unfortunately all too often occurring issues, the movie is fairly okay as a whole. Obviously I cannot agree with the glowing all-star ratings that some people have been giving it but it is far from the single star trashing that other people have been giving it. Technically it was very good with nice special effects. Bullock performed as well as can be expected with the script she was given. Clooney felt a bit out-of-place as a skilled astronaut to me but then he was not really in the movie that much.\n\nTo me it was a fairly enjoyable popcorn movie.", "created_at": "2017-12-20T13:26:40.379Z"}, {"movie_id": 49047, "review_id": "63002aabb39e35007a84cbcf", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "**A cinematography masterclass!**\r\n\r\nThe cinematography of this movie is a breathtaking feat, unlike anything I have ever seen!

I have not felt continued tension like this film in some time. The entire movie is so isolated and desperate, it is incredibly immersive. It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The script is a bit rough at times, a large portion of the dialogue does not seem realistic and can come off as corny sometimes, especially with George Clooney's character. Overall, it is short, face paced, and thrilling and I would highly recommend.\r\n\r\nScore: 82%\r\nVerdict: Great", "created_at": "2023-01-06T21:25:47.523Z"}]
