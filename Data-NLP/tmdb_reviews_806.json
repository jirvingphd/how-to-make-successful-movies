The cast I guess tried their best but having just recently watched the original, I was mostly bored as this pretty much follows the same exact plot, scene for scene. **1.0/5**", "created_at": "2019-10-12T22:43:29.312Z"}, {"movie_id": 806, "review_id": "631593e59408ec0083e2160d", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "Usually remakes are risky. Sometimes they turn better (rarely), sometimes worse. This movie is definitely a good remake and actually better than original. Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, David Thewlis & Pete Postlethwaite deliver a powerful acting. Story is same, but better quality, better production & better acting. Movie is definitely one of my favorites.", "created_at": "2022-09-05T06:15:01.080Z"}]
