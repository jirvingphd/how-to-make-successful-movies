The film focuses on the maturity and bravery of Robinson in overcoming enormous opposition. 42 tells the story well while still capturing the weight and pressure of each moment of the game. I could see Robinson\u2019s skill as well as his motivation and resolve. This movie portrays the sport of baseball well but is ultimately about the power of character in the face of overwhelming opposition and how it can change attitudes, hearts, and minds.", "created_at": "2022-08-19T23:10:25.095Z"}]
