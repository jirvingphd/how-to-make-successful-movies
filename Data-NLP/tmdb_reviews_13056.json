The character was so popular at the time that he inspired a black & white magazine as well (1989).\r\n\r\nThe reason The Punisher was and continues to be so popular is because he's essentially an over-the-top version of \"Dirty Harry\" and \"Deathwish\": Frank Castle's family is killed by the mob while on a picnic in Central Park and so he declares war on all criminals wherein he becomes their judge, jury and executioner. Unlike Daredevil, a lawyer who utilizes the justice system, The Punisher just kills 'em all.\r\n\r\nThe first movie version was 1989's \"The Punisher\" with Dolph Lundgren, which was a disappointment. Lundgren was good, but the movie was too Grade B cartoony and it took too many liberties. Still, some consider it a cult flick. The 2004 movie with Thomas Jane curiously transferred the character from New York City to sunny Florida, specifically the Tampa area. There were other oddities that didn\u2019t sit well, but Jane was good as the protagonist and there was enough good in the flick to marginally enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThis 2008 rendition, \u201cPunisher: War Zone,\u201d was originally intended to be a sequel to the 2004 movie with Thomas Jane, but delays in the production caused him to pull out. Lexi Alexander ultimately got the gig as director and she pitched the idea of doing the film \u201cas a throwback to '80s era action films\u201d with 6\u20194\u201d Ray Stevenson taking over as The Punisher.\r\n\r\nJigsaw (Dominic West) makes for a memorable villain with Loony Bin Jim an entertaining wacko sidekick (Doug Hutchison).

The cinematography/locations/lighting are exceptional. While the movie has the urban grittiness of Nolan\u2019s Batman trilogy, it balances it out with amusing cartoonish-ness. There is some quality drama, like Castle\u2019s anguish over killing a \u201cgood guy\u201d and his dealings with the dead agent\u2019s widow & daughter, but it\u2019s not overlong and dull like in \u201cBatman Begins\u201d (2005) and \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d (2008).
