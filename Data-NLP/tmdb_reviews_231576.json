It's more like taking a serious situation and presenting it to someone in a very palatable, if obvious fashion.\r\n\r\nThis is a \"life is hard\", mixed with \"tragic family event\" tropes with some nice multi-threading for sub plots.\r\n\r\nWhile it's a nice story of pushing through adversity, it's still a heavy story, a sad story, but (like in real life) it's about getting past the bad to grow the good.", "created_at": "2020-10-03T15:57:48.279Z"}]
