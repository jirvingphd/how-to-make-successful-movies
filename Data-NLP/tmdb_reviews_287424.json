[{"movie_id": 287424, "review_id": "56116c319251414ec60032b0", "author_rating": 6.5, "review_text": "> A tale of a father who stood by his daughter till the final.\r\n\r\nThe zombie apocalyptic drama that centres around a father-daughter relationship. When the daughter is infected by the necroa virus which turns humans into the cannibalistic, the loving father stands by her side, but how long is the remaining film.\r\n\r\nOne of the blacklisted screenplay and a low budget film that surprised me for having Arnie on-board. Chloe Grace Moretz was supposed to play the title character, would have been definitely a perfect fit. Because I've seen her excellence in the 'Carrie' remake, anyway her replace Abigail Breslin did perform well.\r\n\r\nI had seen many movies of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but as I remember this is the first time seen him in a casual, realistic and emotional outfit. Maybe his age is restricting him from taking up the tough roles to play as what he was known for, but still I'm happy that he's doing movies that fits him right now.\r\n\r\nFor the one reason it is called a horror and you know why, but it was not horrifying. A slow paced simplest zombie movie. Enjoyable film for the sake of the cast, yet forgettable and move on kind of flick.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd/10", "created_at": "2015-10-04T18:13:05.225Z"}]
