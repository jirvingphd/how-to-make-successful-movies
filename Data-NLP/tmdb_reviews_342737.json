Dorothea enlists the help of two younger women in Jamie's upbringing - via Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a free-spirited punk artist living as a boarder in the Fields' home, and Julie (Elle Fanning), a savvy and provocative teenage neighbor.\r\n\r\nBeing a single parent is tough, it is even tougher when your son is a teenager dealing with romances, the freeing energy of punk music and playing games which entails panting real hard while someone pulls on their diaphragm.

Dorothea does not need help with the physical needs of raising a child in providing shelter and nutrition but the psychological needs of raising in a child in providing the knowledge about life, women and what it means to be a man.

Ellie, who is closest to Jaime\u2019s age, is the last one to tackle the task given to her and if she wasn\u2019t already sneaking into Jaime\u2019s bed every night, she probably would have avoided the task altogether.

Yes, if it was Annette Bening's Dorothea's story, then it justifies. But the story does not have one perspective of narration. All the main characters like Bening, Elle, Greta, Crudup and Zumann, shared screen equally. So, instead I would have preferred the title, '20th Century Tale'.\r\n\r\nGreta kind of reminded me Kristen Stewart with the hair like that. Two hours long drama with some funs. Really a good film. The topics it brings in for discussion were interesting, especially which is in the current era. Films like this should be watching. It is about the life, people with different characters and ambitions.\r\n\r\n_7/10_", "created_at": "2017-09-08T00:56:19.844Z"}, {"movie_id": 342737, "review_id": "62b0bf8272c13e008c5fea3d", "author_rating": 10.0, "review_text": "Full review: <a>https://www.tinakakadelis.com/beyond-the-cinerama-dome/2021/12/28/-20th-century-women-review<a>\r\n\r\nDirector Mike Mills has described _20th Century Women_ as a love letter to his childhood set in a sleepy Santa Barbara of 1979.
