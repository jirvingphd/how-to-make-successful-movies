He is \"Howard\", a curmudgeonly old gent who lives alone - washing his smalls in the kitchen sink and caring little about anything but his crossword puzzle. His daughter \"Grace\" (Catherine Walker) is at the end of her tether, so she employs local lady \"Annie\" (Brid Brennan) to do a bit of housekeeping for him. He is not at all keen on this arrangement; indeed is so rude as to have her walk out on him, but a few of her more homely touches make him begin to realise that the pit into which his life has slid is perhaps not the only solution. Pretty quickly the two are getting on like an house on fire and gradually this causes a degree of chagrin for the daughter who sees her own role in his life beginning to become less crucial - as she, herself, is watching her own marriage disintegrate. Can they all find a way to make things work? It's a gentle romance this film, with some enjoyable and poignant performances from the three principals that highlights how people cope with grief, loneliness and opportunity. Director Klaus H\u00e4r\u00f6 allows the talent to deliver a considered series of portrayals that marry the happy and the sad in a plausible fashion. I can't say I loved the ending. Though perfectly realistic, it seemed a little unnecessary to me - but you be the judge. It doesn't need a cinema screen, but is well worth watching the loads of experience at character acting ooze from Brennan and Cosmo.", "created_at": "2023-03-26T14:55:52.284Z"}, {"movie_id": 511424, "review_id": "64205cf88d22fc00ef16cb95", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "James Cosmo is quite good here in one of his few leading roles.
