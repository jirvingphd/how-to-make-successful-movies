Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean \"dumb\" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond \"genuinely good people may be flawed and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.\" Thankfully, this installment throws in some entertaining father/son character development in between the wild action sequences. McClane\u2019s daughter also appears for good measure (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).\r\n\r\nThe story isn't quite as engaging as \"Live Free or Die Hard\" (2007), but it was good enough and the action scenes are out of this world, including a long vehicle chase in Moscow in the opening act. Director Moore ups the ante with quick-editing for this one. Some parts are eye-rolling absurd, but everything's done with a quasi-realistic tone, which sorta helps the viewer go along with the ridiculousness rather than tune out.\r\n\r\nThe Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's \"The Gauntlet\" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's \"The Mummy Returns.\" Thankfully, \"A Good Day to Die Hard\" pretty much evades that ditch by giving us entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story. Speaking of the story, one of the highlights is the infamous Russian location of the final act. Another highlight is hottie raven-haired Yuliya Snigir.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 38 minutes and was shot in Budapest, Hungary, with the Chernobyl scenes done at Old Soviet Air Force Base, Kiskunlach\u00e1za, Hungary, along with establishing shots of Moscow.
