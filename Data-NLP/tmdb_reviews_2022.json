I think this is the movie where John McEnroe started getting involved.\r\n\r\n The character work in this is either drastically good or drastically bad, and they definitely experimented with some ideas they had in the backlog.\r\n\r\nThe \"rags to riches\" trope crossed with the \"NYC is a cesspool of money corruption\" trope is actually inspired.  There is a great script in this movie, behind all the Sandler style humor, but that humor does make it fun, I just wish there was an adjustable setting sometimes.\r\n\r\nUltimately anything that isn't funny or charming in this is brief enough that you can overlook it pretty easily.", "created_at": "2020-08-14T00:45:25.967Z"}, {"movie_id": 2022, "review_id": "64b8713c3009aa013967502a", "author_rating": 10.0, "review_text": "I love Adam Sandler movies. This one is another favorite. A hick guy finds out he just inherited millions. Very funny movie, sneaky sneaky sir! Never underestimate the sneakiness.", "created_at": "2023-07-19T23:26:52.435Z"}]
