I didn't see that coming.\r\n\r\n<em>'Hannah Montana: The Movie'</em> kept me suitably entertained from start-to-finish, it is so much better than I would've predicted. I have never seen an episode of the television series either.\r\n\r\nIt features a surprisingly interesting and fairly meaningful story, sure the ending is extremely Disneyfied and nonsensical but they make it work. For what it is, it's a relatively engaging storyline. There are a few bits of neat cinematography, also. Music-wise it's alright, \"The Climb\" is a (good) song that I was already familiar with.\r\n\r\nMiley Cyrus does a respectable job in the lead role(s). Billy Ray Cyrus, Margo Martindale, Vanessa Williams and Barry Bostwick all feature too, as does a young Natalia Dyer. I like the casting.\r\n\r\nI had very low expectations coming into this, but it's a film that pleasantly surprised me. I'd say it's worthy of a watch.", "created_at": "2020-11-07T00:42:04.133Z"}]
