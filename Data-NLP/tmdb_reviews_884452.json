Simply insert the country of choice, in this case the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and away you go.\r\n\r\nIn terms of its combat scenes and visuals this film is well paced, reasonably convincing and will resonate with war film enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nIts patriotic leanings will, of course, potentially appeal to UAE audiences, no doubt its intended demographic. \r\n\r\nI will add and this needs be said, the tragic situation that developed in Yemen, was provoked and furthered, by the West, who profited greatly from the war that developed in that nation. This contextual reality, needs to be understood. Those Yemenis fighting on the ground, might also be considered patriots for their own nations cause. \r\n\r\nIn summary, well made but predictable patriotic fare, that's watchable but its clear bias, needs to be kept in mind. There's far more to the conflict in Yemen, than this simplistic interpretation, would suggest.", "created_at": "2022-12-31T21:23:42.581Z"}]
