That doesn't stop it from being crass in the worst possible way, or completely uncomfortable. Or completely unoriginal... although I guess you could argue that part is by necessity... Look, what I'm saying is, credit where credit's due. It's like, fuck _Transformers_, what a garbage bunch of films those are, but at the same time, it's hard to knock a billion dollar gross earning.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal_.", "created_at": "2018-09-07T03:10:22.782Z"}, {"movie_id": 11397, "review_id": "64b9e3ea06f98400ac51ddb1", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "This movie is so hilarious. It will be a lot more funny to you if you seen all the movies that this is making fun of.
