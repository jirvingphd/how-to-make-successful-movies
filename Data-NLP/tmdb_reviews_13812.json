The plot is very simple but it could keep me watching it to the end. So, I'd say it's kind of watchable even if a lot of people would say it's not. \r\n\r\nP.S.\u200b I kind of find that the main character, Angela is so annoying. I even wanted her to die and turn into zombie-like thing. (No offence.) Although it didn't show clearly how it ended, but I deeply hope and take it that Angela didn't survive. It's so sad that they didn't show the end of Angela.", "created_at": "2023-05-02T13:34:36.739Z"}]
