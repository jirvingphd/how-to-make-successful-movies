Stewart spends the time being on the verge of cracking for the whole of the film and it's an impressive sight.\r\n\r\nStewart's Diana stands out just like the way the colour of her outfits provides a pop of colour to the mostly drab setting. Performances from the support cast are minimal with dialogue between the royal family are few and far between.\r\n\r\nMusic is classical and restrained with discordant jazz matching the discordant feelings going on in the rural estate\r\n\r\nThe clash of tradition and the new is at a the fore here like a flower beating against an armoured tank. It's where the new of Diana tries to prepare to enter an institution of centuries of tradition. This Diana is shown to completely and utterly not belong. The family is forever waiting for her and is even have here kept within barb wire fences like a prisoner. She desperately wants to cut these wires.\r\n\r\nParallels with Anne Boelyn are drawn - a woman who didn\u2019t fair too well herself. The symbolism of Diana\u2019s home reflects her past - something that is now gone for her, but she wants to desperately get back to it. \r\nThere\u2019s a distinct lack of love portrayed in the royal family. \r\n\r\nEven the staff are models of military precision and tradition with Spall taking up the role of rules enforcer. The family and staff spend most of their time criticising Diana or ordering her about. They are always distant - Diana is mostly shown alone and needs a fantasy to get out of it.\r\n\r\nThe film is ultimately very sympathetic to Diana - the royal family aren\u2019t much above the level of monsters.", "created_at": "2022-01-25T22:19:33.144Z"}, {"movie_id": 716612, "review_id": "61f87bfbb7abb500e88a57eb", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "If I were a royalty groupie, I might have enoyed this film.

The Royal family meets to celebrate the three days of Christmas, strictly according to tradition. However, the peace and perfection of the residence are in contrast with the tumultuous mind of Diana and the delusions of the family. Rumours about infidelity and divorce on her marriage increase, as well as her mental health troubles.    What is going to happen? How is Diana going to deal with the Royals and her mind?

She immerses herself completely in this depiction of a rather unstable woman dealing with the pressures of her fame and her family. The extent of any authenticity as to the feelings and experiences by the real life Princess is anyone's guess, so though I did appreciate her effort, I felt the rest of the film took a rather uncompromising view on other people who are either dead, or unable to retaliate against this somewhat one-sided portrayal of a scenario that all concerned have subsequently admitted was way more nuanced and complex than presented in this overly-simplistic depiction. It doesn't help that the opening scenes purport to be Queen Elizabeth's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, but look nothing remotely like that distinctive building - and from there on in, the story speculates wildly on real life events in a fashion that I just found irritating, implausible - hysterical, even. Her ability to randomly roam the countryside (with or without her children) without any security beggars belief somewhat, and the somewhat curious references to \"currency\" alluding to the double edged swords of a privileged no pain no gain existence is all just too contrived. This portrayal of an emotionally struggling lady is to be commended, but it has little to do with reality and as a man who lived in the UK throughout the rise and fall of this flawed individual, much of this comes across as little more than a clumsy attempt to capitalise on a tragic story with scant regard to anyone else who actually had to endure at that time - or, indeed, to fact.", "created_at": "2022-03-27T11:33:36.710Z"}, {"movie_id": 716612, "review_id": "62b0bab4f1b571008b80d297", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Full review: <a>https://www.tinakakadelis.com/beyond-the-cinerama-dome/2021/12/28/you-owe-kristen-stewart-an-apology-spencer-review<a>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s crazy to think that Kristen Stewart is the only American actress to ever receive a C\u00e9sar Award, and yet when I say her name, most people will only remember her in _Twilight_.", "created_at": "2022-06-20T18:21:40.678Z"}]
