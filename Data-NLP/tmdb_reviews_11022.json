A hard-hitting, realistic look at the undercover police world with a bitter taste of the cases that they work. Jason Patric and Ray Liotia play the parts of two Detroit police offers tasked with bringing the killers of a fellow undercover officer to justice.\r\n\r\nDark, gritty and overwhelming, Narc doesn't sugarcoat law enforcement but somehow keeps the experience real without turning the opinion of the viewer against the officers, who often bend the rules as far as they can without going over the edge.\r\n\r\nExcellent drama, along with some very realistic dialog and some top-notch acting brings this title to the forefront of its niche. I guarantee you won't figure out \"who done it\" until the very end. Definitely not a date night movie, or something to watch while the kids are around, but something perfect for a rainy afternoon flick with the guys.", "created_at": "2019-08-02T02:29:22.852Z"}]
