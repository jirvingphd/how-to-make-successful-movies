It was entirely shot in the two weeks of time. Directed by a first timer, it tells the true story of Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson's first date back in the 1989 during working for a big law firm in Chicago. Like how Michelle denied it is a date as co-workers should not engage in a close relationship. While Obama is trying to win her heart, the film reveals their day, what they talk and do and how it all ends.\r\n\r\nThis is not a biographical film I was expecting. I mean I was looking forward to the film, but not this kind of simple story. This looks like another version of 'Before Sunrise', and I won't be surprised if they make a sequel in a similar fashion, maybe a trilogy. So this is a one day event when they were young and passionate about their work, somewhat they both liked each other, though they knew their limits. The writer-come-director confirms all the events from his film really occurred, but not all of them in just one date.\r\n\r\nThe actors were good, especially I liked Parker Sawyers as Barack Obama. For me, this is not a great film, but decently made one. Obama fans might like it, though you could try it if you like date film in a realistic manner. It's Obama's early life, so there's nothing about his present politics or the president post, except talking about their future plans. But most of the film about between them and their life, like how they grew how, what they love and loved, those kind of stuffs. So I hope you watch it with a low expectation.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_", "created_at": "2016-12-24T16:16:04.139Z"}, {"movie_id": 310888, "review_id": "64cca67b798e06011d81e0ba", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "Inspired by Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s first date in 1989, \u201cSouthside With You\u201d is a fun period premise that just isn\u2019t fully realized. It\u2019s not romantic enough to be a traditional date movie and it tries too hard to be a racially focused drama, making this talky film from writer-director Richard Tanne much more of a bore than a joy to sit through.\r\n\r\nThe movie focuses on one date and takes place over one day in and around Chicago. Summer law firm associate Barack (Parker Sawyers) picks up his colleague Michelle (Tika Sumpter) to spend the day chatting and exploring their city. In a blatant rip-off of the far better \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d series, this film starts off delightful and then becomes just too cutesy and preachy to be meaningful.\r\n\r\nThe film makes Obama out to be some sort of savior for the poor and the disenfranchised which I guess is okay, but it\u2019s also more than a little irritating. (The religious imagery becomes so forced that there\u2019s a scene in a church where Obama is bathed in sunlight).\r\n\r\nThe early banter in the \u2018first date\u2019 scenes are fun, romantic and enjoyably charming, much due to the charismatic performances from Sawyers and Sumpter. It\u2019s when the discussions turn more and more towards race and poverty that the film begins to feel like it\u2019s an exercise in pandering to the liberal crowd. Ultimately it becomes a bland attempt at pointed social, gender and racial commentary.\r\n\r\nThis movie is short (84 minutes) but it should\u2019ve been even shorter. There\u2019s just not enough compelling material to make an interesting feature film.", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:19:23.808Z"}]
