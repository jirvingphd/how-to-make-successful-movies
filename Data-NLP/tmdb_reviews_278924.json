The veteran action star is out for more blood in the labored sequel **Mechanic: Resurrection**. The trouble, however, is that fist-swinging wrecking ball Statham\u2019s taste for boisterous blood in his latest toothless and meandering globe-trotting caper may be in desperate need of a transfusion. Woefully repetitive, aimless, strained and riddled with formulaic sharp-shooting shenanigans, **Mechanic: Resurrection** is yet another bombastic Bond knock-off that synthetically strut its stuff in stunt-driven oblivion. The majority of Statham fans may find this latest installment of **Mechanic** worth tinkering with due to its kinetic action-pack parts in motion with its stylish bald-headed anti-hero at the helm of voyeuristic mayhem. Still, for others the excitable human bullet factor routine that the aging Statham has perfected in his past furious film exploits (read: \u201cThe Transporter\u201d film series in particular) is getting long in the tooth as **Mechanic: Resurrection** is yet another familiar and feisty vehicle that the punishing tough guy has predictably driven before.\r\n\r\n**Resurrection** is the follow-up to the 2011 blueprint _The Mechanic_ where Statham portrayed a stone-faced iron man \u201cgun-for-hire\u201d whose mission is to travel the world while eradicating high-profiled baddies\u2013a specialty that he mechanically and skillfully carries out with polished precision. Naturally Statham\u2019s charged take as the combative assassin is based upon the 1972 flick _The Mechanic_ featuring the late great gravel-faced action icon Charles Bronson who was no stranger to vigilante-style cinema.  Statham\u2019s \u201ctake-no-prisoners\u201d approach as the hardened terminator Arthur Bishop is definitely inspired when the English acrobatic avenger is summoned to brandish exotic weaponry, engage in calculating yet cockeyed ways to utilize boobytraps to exterminate his assigned targets and find time to occasionally court the hot chicks that dig his masculine, mischievous charm. No doubt that Statham\u2019s blue-collar Bishop tries to echo the eye-popping sentiments of the aforementioned Bond\u2019s debonair endeavors in intrigue, over-the-top villains, lavish locales and luscious ladies. As for watching the five decade-old adventurous James Bond it feels like an excitable surreal vacation laced with imaginative dare and danger. In witnessing Statham\u2019s stiffened and procedural Arthur Bishop it seems somewhat like an assigned chore in chronicling the gadget-loving gumption of this action-oriented covert clone.\r\n\r\nSure, **Mechanic: Resurrection** derives its occasional chilly appeal from the scenic locations that allows the athletic Bishop to bounce around the globe on an elaborated whim. Plus, some may get an aesthetic rise out of the choreographed in-your-face confrontational fights and showy staged daredevil stunts that feature Bishop\u2019s physical prowess. This is all well and good but the dubious dalliances and action-oriented swaggering that is demonstrated by Statham\u2019s bone-crushing Bishop is rather uneventful and recycled. Unfortunately, **Resurrection** refuses to allow Statham any flexible growth or depth to differentiate his caustic characterization or the high-wire dilemmas beyond the previous antics regurgitated from his earlier copycat fare as _Crank_, _The Bank Job_ and yes\u2026the obvious mention of _The Transporter_ series.\r\n\r\nHit man Arthur Bishop is basking in the scenic Rio de Janeiro  surroundings in hopes of drowning out his deadly duties from yesteryear. Soon, Bishop\u2019s wake-up call to resume his treacherous trade in taking out toxic targets is encouraged by his archenemy in warped businessman Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine). Specifically, Crain wants Bishop to assassinate three persons of interest in particular that has him roaming three different continents. Bishop is not too receptive to getting back in \u201cthe grusome game\u201d but of course the crooked Crain has a twisted way of convincing him otherwise. The critical key to changing a reluctant Bishop\u2019s mind was to hit him where is heart hurts\u2026that is, abduct his gorgeous girlfriend Gina (Jessica Alba from \u201cSin City\u201d).\r\n\r\nHolding Gina captive clearly gives Crain the upper hand to urge the beleaguered Bishop to return to the fatalistic fold of his poisonous profession\u2013wiping out the assigned undesirables while making it look like accidental incidents. Thus, Bishop puts on his traveling shoes as he hunts down an imprisoned African warlord, an Australian human trafficker and finally a Bulgaria-based arms dealer Max Adams (Oscar winner Tommy Lee Jones). If and when Bishop delivers his three kills for the ruthless Crain then Gina\u2019s release is assured. It is a no-brainer that Bishop wants to ensure the safety of the exotic beauty Gina.\r\n\r\nAlba\u2019s Gina is not the only lovely lady that is attached to Bishop\u2019s hip affectionately. In Thailand, Bishop manages to catch up with another cute bombshell in buddy Mei (martial arts goddess Michelle Yeoh wasted in a transparent role), an innkeeper that worries about her friend\u2019s worldly welfare. Curiously, German director Dennis Gansel\u2019s decision not to give the desirable ageless Asian actress anything to do constructive in this by-the-numbers actioner besides providing sideline concern for Statham\u2019s Bishop is inexcusable. Why not play to Yeoh\u2019s cinematic strengths as a karate-kicking cutie pie with a deadly disposition\u2026you know, what movie audiences have come to expect and cherish about the beautiful Malaysian performer\u2019s film-related credibility? The 1997 Bond film _Tomorrow Never Dies_ effectively used the curvaceous Yeoh to compliment Pierce Brosnan\u2019s Agent 007 so Gansel could not oblige her more on-screen activity with the robotic Statham?\r\n\r\nOf course any Statham-oriented movie would not be complete without the arbitrary display of colorful explosions, glorified chases, exaggerated gunplay and a no-nonsense Bishop predictably flexing his acrobatic leaping, climbing, swimming and fighting muscles as if he was participating in his own self-indulgent Olympic games. There is no real rhyme or reason behind Mechanic: Resurrection other than to revisit the nostalgic relevance of Statham\u2019s left-over box office heft from yesteryear. Perhaps the proven off-kilter spark that Statham generated in the Melissa McCarthy well-received espionage laugher _Spy_ could have been injected in this gimmicky and pointless pot-boiler that has all the succulent juices of a dried-up meatloaf. All the challenging stunt work and exquisite locations cannot excuse the lack of lubrication that Mechanic desires in its insipid, loud execution.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to chew on the bone concerning the so-called return of Statham\u2019s harried hit man that constitutes round two of another dazzling but dense **Mechanic** offering. Alba\u2019s distressed diva is nothing more than stand-by eye candy and the convenient motivating factor for Statham\u2019s/Bishop\u2019s worldwide witch-hunt. Hazeldine\u2019s Crain barely passes muster as a second-rate Bond villain left on the cutting room floor. Jones, who has played wacky villains in the past, merely going through the tiresome motions as pseudo-flashy Max Adams with off-the-cuff irreverence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Arthur Bishop\u2019s glossy gadgets could prevent an unwelcoming third edition of another **Mechanic** entry from blasting away in boorish fashion?\r\n\r\n**Mechanic: Resurrection** (2016)\r\n\r\nSummit Entertainment\r\n\r\n1 hr. 50 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jason Statham, Jessica Alba, Tommy Lee Jones, Sam Hazeldine, Michelle Yeoh, Natalie Burn, Yayaying Rhatha Phongam\r\n\r\nDirected by: Dennis Gansel\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Action and Adventure/Suspense Thriller/International Crime Drama\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016", "created_at": "2016-08-29T02:09:15.227Z"}, {"movie_id": 278924, "review_id": "584467c5925141676400c697", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "**Falling in love is a trap, but some men risk everything for it.**\r\n\r\nThis is an unexpected sequel. Actually, I was looking for other sequels from Statham's filmography, particularly the third 'Crank'. I think the idea of going for it was good and the film was not that bad, if your purpose of a watch is time pass. The story was so bad, but the filmmaking was excellent. Because it was made by a renowned German director. Only if he had got a better script, the outcome would have been different. So it's the actors and the director makes it watchable. Other than that, this film falls into the average category.\r\n\r\nThe story follows after Arthur Bishop was found living in Brasil by some people who know him. Then he narrowly escapes from there and lands in Southeast Asia, where he meets Gina, a woman struggling from domestic violence. But he soon discovers that's a setup.

The 1997 Bond film _Tomorrow Never Dies_ effectively used the curvaceous Yeoh to compliment Pierce Brosnan\u2019s Agent 007 so Gansel could not oblige her more on-screen activity with the robotic Statham?\r\n\r\nOf course any Statham-oriented movie would not be complete without the arbitrary display of colorful explosions, glorified chases, exaggerated gunplay and a no-nonsense Bishop predictably flexing his acrobatic leaping, climbing, swimming and fighting muscles as if he was participating in his own self-indulgent Olympic games. There is no real rhyme or reason behind Mechanic: Resurrection other than to revisit the nostalgic relevance of Statham\u2019s left-over box office heft from yesteryear. Perhaps the proven off-kilter spark that Statham generated in the Melissa McCarthy well-received espionage laugher _Spy_ could have been injected in this gimmicky and pointless pot-boiler that has all the succulent juices of a dried-up meatloaf. All the challenging stunt work and exquisite locations cannot excuse the lack of lubrication that Mechanic desires in its insipid, loud execution.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to chew on the bone concerning the so-called return of Statham\u2019s harried hit man that constitutes round two of another dazzling but dense **Mechanic** offering. Alba\u2019s distressed diva is nothing more than stand-by eye candy and the convenient motivating factor for Statham\u2019s/Bishop\u2019s worldwide witch-hunt. Hazeldine\u2019s Crain barely passes muster as a second-rate Bond villain left on the cutting room floor.

Actually, I was looking for other sequels from Statham's filmography, particularly the third 'Crank'. I think the idea of going for it was good and the film was not that bad, if your purpose of a watch is time pass. The story was so bad, but the filmmaking was excellent. Because it was made by a renowned German director. Only if he had got a better script, the outcome would have been different. So it's the actors and the director makes it watchable.

The veteran action star is out for more blood in the labored sequel **Mechanic: Resurrection**. The trouble, however, is that fist-swinging wrecking ball Statham\u2019s taste for boisterous blood in his latest toothless and meandering globe-trotting caper may be in desperate need of a transfusion. Woefully repetitive, aimless, strained and riddled with formulaic sharp-shooting shenanigans, **Mechanic: Resurrection** is yet another bombastic Bond knock-off that synthetically strut its stuff in stunt-driven oblivion. The majority of Statham fans may find this latest installment of **Mechanic** worth tinkering with due to its kinetic action-pack parts in motion with its stylish bald-headed anti-hero at the helm of voyeuristic mayhem. Still, for others the excitable human bullet factor routine that the aging Statham has perfected in his past furious film exploits (read: \u201cThe Transporter\u201d film series in particular) is getting long in the tooth as **Mechanic: Resurrection** is yet another familiar and feisty vehicle that the punishing tough guy has predictably driven before.\r\n\r\n**Resurrection** is the follow-up to the 2011 blueprint _The Mechanic_ where Statham portrayed a stone-faced iron man \u201cgun-for-hire\u201d whose mission is to travel the world while eradicating high-profiled baddies\u2013a specialty that he mechanically and skillfully carries out with polished precision. Naturally Statham\u2019s charged take as the combative assassin is based upon the 1972 flick _The Mechanic_ featuring the late great gravel-faced action icon Charles Bronson who was no stranger to vigilante-style cinema.  Statham\u2019s \u201ctake-no-prisoners\u201d approach as the hardened terminator Arthur Bishop is definitely inspired when the English acrobatic avenger is summoned to brandish exotic weaponry, engage in calculating yet cockeyed ways to utilize boobytraps to exterminate his assigned targets and find time to occasionally court the hot chicks that dig his masculine, mischievous charm. No doubt that Statham\u2019s blue-collar Bishop tries to echo the eye-popping sentiments of the aforementioned Bond\u2019s debonair endeavors in intrigue, over-the-top villains, lavish locales and luscious ladies. As for watching the five decade-old adventurous James Bond it feels like an excitable surreal vacation laced with imaginative dare and danger. In witnessing Statham\u2019s stiffened and procedural Arthur Bishop it seems somewhat like an assigned chore in chronicling the gadget-loving gumption of this action-oriented covert clone.\r\n\r\nSure, **Mechanic: Resurrection** derives its occasional chilly appeal from the scenic locations that allows the athletic Bishop to bounce around the globe on an elaborated whim. Plus, some may get an aesthetic rise out of the choreographed in-your-face confrontational fights and showy staged daredevil stunts that feature Bishop\u2019s physical prowess. This is all well and good but the dubious dalliances and action-oriented swaggering that is demonstrated by Statham\u2019s bone-crushing Bishop is rather uneventful and recycled. Unfortunately, **Resurrection** refuses to allow Statham any flexible growth or depth to differentiate his caustic characterization or the high-wire dilemmas beyond the previous antics regurgitated from his earlier copycat fare as _Crank_, _The Bank Job_ and yes\u2026the obvious mention of _The Transporter_ series.\r\n\r\nHit man Arthur Bishop is basking in the scenic Rio de Janeiro  surroundings in hopes of drowning out his deadly duties from yesteryear. Soon, Bishop\u2019s wake-up call to resume his treacherous trade in taking out toxic targets is encouraged by his archenemy in warped businessman Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine). Specifically, Crain wants Bishop to assassinate three persons of interest in particular that has him roaming three different continents. Bishop is not too receptive to getting back in \u201cthe grusome game\u201d but of course the crooked Crain has a twisted way of convincing him otherwise. The critical key to changing a reluctant Bishop\u2019s mind was to hit him where is heart hurts\u2026that is, abduct his gorgeous girlfriend Gina (Jessica Alba from \u201cSin City\u201d).\r\n\r\nHolding Gina captive clearly gives Crain the upper hand to urge the beleaguered Bishop to return to the fatalistic fold of his poisonous profession\u2013wiping out the assigned undesirables while making it look like accidental incidents. Thus, Bishop puts on his traveling shoes as he hunts down an imprisoned African warlord, an Australian human trafficker and finally a Bulgaria-based arms dealer Max Adams (Oscar winner Tommy Lee Jones). If and when Bishop delivers his three kills for the ruthless Crain then Gina\u2019s release is assured. It is a no-brainer that Bishop wants to ensure the safety of the exotic beauty Gina.\r\n\r\nAlba\u2019s Gina is not the only lovely lady that is attached to Bishop\u2019s hip affectionately. In Thailand, Bishop manages to catch up with another cute bombshell in buddy Mei (martial arts goddess Michelle Yeoh wasted in a transparent role), an innkeeper that worries about her friend\u2019s worldly welfare. Curiously, German director Dennis Gansel\u2019s decision not to give the desirable ageless Asian actress anything to do constructive in this by-the-numbers actioner besides providing sideline concern for Statham\u2019s Bishop is inexcusable.
