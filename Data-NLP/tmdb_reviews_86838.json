I've adored her ever since I first saw her in _Hitman_, and was absolutely blown away by her _Centurion_ performance. Though she does practically nothing here, it's always fantastic to see her get more work (particularly in such a great film).\r\n\r\nWoody Harrelson (_Natural Born Killers_, _Defendor_) has also been one I've kept my eye on for some time now.
