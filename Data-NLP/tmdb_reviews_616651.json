Allison, played by Abigail Breslin. They all do fine work and there is a strong ensemble cast behind them. They do a good job mixing the captioned French dialogue with the English speakers.\r\n\r\nThe plot eventually relies upon a rather large coincidence, but the dialogue and script are crisp, so it all works. Don\u2019t expect a sappy ending here. As in real life, some things work out and some don\u2019t.", "created_at": "2022-01-04T13:50:49.536Z"}]
