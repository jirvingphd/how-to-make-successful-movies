The film follows a man who is made to go through an 8-minute window repeatedly to locate the person responsible for a train bombing. As the loop repeats, the plot thickens. It's a pretty good film which keeps you at the edge of the seat and reveals to you in stages as to what is going on. The cast has done a good job portraying their roles. It's a Sci-Fi that deserves one watch at least (but you might do two to get it)", "created_at": "2019-02-15T06:26:20.562Z"}, {"movie_id": 45612, "review_id": "5c665b8cc3a3684f97dcd8fc", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Source Code is a \u201crepeating loop\u201d Science Fiction film directed by Duncan Jones whose prior film was Moon.
