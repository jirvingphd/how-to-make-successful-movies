I mean, the description even mentions the Coen brothers as a basis for comparison. With Jeff Bridges' role, it was difficult not to think of The Big Lebowski, but this film isn't of that caliber.\r\n\r\nStill, I thought it was entertaining most of the time. There were slow interludes that could have been removed to improve the pacing without harming the story.

The flashbacks weren't confusing, but in a slower paced film like this one, I think they were sometimes more of a distraction than plot-enhancers.
