But fame & fortune has blinded him and he\u2019s lost the love of the art, even his love for best friends. When a new edgy magician enters the scene (Jim Carrey), it gives Burt a wake-up call and forces him to reexamine his life & career and rediscover his love for magic. Olivia Wilde is on hand as a magician\u2019s assistant while Alan Arkin plays an older magician.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone\u201d (2013) didn\u2019t do well at the box office, maybe because of the lousy title. Yet it\u2019s a solid comedy/drama about magicians, traditional ones and edgier modern ones (which some argue don\u2019t perform \u201ctrue magic\u201d). Olivia looks great and I wish her role was bigger. Gillian Jacobs (Miranda) and Tate Hanyok (Nicole) are also featured on the feminine front. Even David Copperfield shows up.\r\n\r\nThe biggest laugh is wisely saved for last. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "created_at": "2020-08-01T18:01:15.937Z"}]
