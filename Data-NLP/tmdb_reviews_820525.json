We continue to follow the hugely disinteresting love antics of the dreary \"Hardin\" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) who, having lost the love of \"Tessa\" (Josephine Langford) had a one night stand with \"Nathalie\" (Mimi Keane) that ended up on the internet. Needless to say, she wasn't best pleased and so now, some time after, he heads to Portugal to try to make amends (and so the crew can get some sun). Of course what he really wants is to reunite with \"Tessa\" but can he grow up enough to realise the errors of his ways and to reconcile with her? Well I really could not have cared less. Initially I found Tiffin to have a little charm about him, but now this part has been well and truly exhausted and he has neither that charm nor any charisma to bring to a role that really consists of a pretty odious and self-indulgent character. There's lots of familial discord, an on/off drink problem (probably for us watching, too) and the ending was more like a sigh of relief for all concerned. I know, I'm not the demographic - but money has been spent on this - and it's money that could have been better spent on - well, just about anything. The characters are weak and though it's quite nicely shot amidst some attractive locations, this is just now well put to bed. Please let's not have a Christmas special.", "created_at": "2023-10-09T04:02:30.469Z"}]
