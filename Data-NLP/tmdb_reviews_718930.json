This kind of offbeat storytelling appeals to Pitt.  I get a flashback of Pitt in \u201cTwelve Monkeys\u201d, embracing the lunacy.   One might also see Tarantino in the storytelling as well.  Most of the critics get it right though, the execution is a little flat.   What works however are the montages of the other assassins and their backstory.  The entire production, and I mean every single shot, feels like it is from a graphic novel.  Careful attention to glowing backlights from buttons or tv screens or fancy lighting in general makes this bristle with Japanese cityscape.   In fact every shot of the Bullet train that goes from Tokyo to Kyoto (which I have taken myself) shows it as (CGI) cityscape.  So the slick feel is done by using cutaway shots of the bullet train never leaving the city (believe it our not in reality the train does go through some countryside) as a punch point as some stunning event happens with the plot.   \r\n\r\nSo this is a thriller, and it tries to throw in some whodunnit of who killed who.  It also adds tension as our protagonist does not know he is in possible danger while the audience has been clued in.   I like the attempt to go against stereotypes with our main characters.   That includes the rich adolescent daughter.  Dressed innocently, she actually has a cold heart.   As for Brad Pitt, he is a little too \u201cthis all for fun\u201d, and becomes a little too relaxed in a movie star going through the motions kind of way.   Which I guarantee is not what Pitt is actually doing.  I think he takes any role seriously and is acting out his character to the fullest.   It's just that his character feels a but thin here.  \r\n\r\nI felt the movie started off on the wrong foot with the banter between Pitt and his handler.  As an editor, I would trusted the audience to let Pitt enter the story without the on the nose exposition.  I also think that a slightly more serious tone would not make the gratuitous violence feel so comic book.   Therein lies the reason this movie exists in the first place, John Wick.  Audiences are expecting creative action sequences,  and there are many set pieces that take advantage of being stuck on a train.  Two other main characters are a lower class set of English assassins, straight from \u201cSnatch\u201d.   That movie depicted a good number of lower class criminals in England speaking goofy dialogue and taking part in some Three Stooges style of mishaps.   The duo here spend the entire movie bickering, finding their personal problems more interesting than our caper.   I felt their schtick was pushed (their names are Tangerine and Lemon), and the expected humour didn't really connect with the audience.  Which is too bad, because they are essentially the main characters, probably getting more screen time than Pitt.  \r\n\r\nThe Japan setting worked very well, although I expect that none of the film was actually shot in Japan, except maybe one of the early establishing shots.   The stylish production design necessitated lots of embellishments to the slick backgrounds that the real world can't match.  That's OK, I appreciated how cool the movie looked as this convoluted world of Japanese but not Japanese criminals go after the Macguffin.   That is, although this a Japanese crime movie, many of the key characters are not Japanese.  \r\n\r\nAs for the action scenes, they are serviceable with a mix of weapons and hand to hand fighting.   However there is an annoying habit of victims dying and not dying.   Those type of one twist too many issues prevent this movie from being a James Bond kind of generic thriller that delivers the goods.   I just recently saw \u201cGray Man\u201d, and took note that although the story had nothing original to say, it stayed to it's core action tenets and didn't try to confuse the audience with any real twists.   So even though both of these films are losers for the critics, there still is a level of roller coaster ride mentality that makes a well made action yarn enjoyable.  So I enjoyed this more than those recent lazy Fast and Furious films, but found the story too convoluted, even more than \u201cGray Man\u201d.  6 out of 10.", "created_at": "2022-08-06T04:16:53.232Z"}, {"movie_id": 718930, "review_id": "62ee87af813cb6009239e458", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "I first got an extended look at \u201cBullet Train\u201d during Cinemacon when a reel of the film was shown during the Sony showcase to an enthusiastic crowd. The footage mixed action and humor with quirky and dysfunctional characters and became a must-see film for me based on the teased footage.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on a book by Kotaro Isaka and stars Brad Pitt as an operative named Ladybug. He is called at the last minute as a replacement and given instructions to board a Bullet Train and snatch a case in one of the passenger areas before exiting at the next station.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through a recent crisis, Ladybug is awash in various philosophical and new age ideas as he attempts to find his inner peace and a new path in life, as such he does not take a gun with him when he boards despite being instructed to do so by his handler.\r\n\r\nThe train is filled with various killers and dangerous people who are there to accomplish various goals and most of whom fail frequently in violent and hysterical manners which further complicate their agendas as well as that of the others and often puts them into conflict with one another as the story unfolds.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to go into further detail on the various characters without spoiling some of the reveals and twists along the way but suffice it to say that Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry as Tangerine and Lemon are great and their banter, as well as capers, is a frequent highlight.\r\n\r\nThere are some surprise cameos in the film which add to the fun and Joey King is as great as perhaps one of the more complicated characters in the film. Pitt is clearly the star but the film allows him as well as his supporting cast plenty of moments to shine and the humor flies fast and frequent as does the action which creates a very engaging and stylistic hybrid of western and Asian cinema.\r\n\r\nThe film does drag slightly late before leading to the finale but thanks to the great cast and action it comes through in the end.\r\n\r\nDirector David Leitch has worked on films such as \u201cDeadpool 2\u201d, \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d, and \u201cJohn Wick: and you can see that he has a knack for directing action and comedy as this is a very fun and engaging film that has some great action and humor and one that you will not want to miss.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5.", "created_at": "2022-08-06T15:24:31.724Z"}, {"movie_id": 718930, "review_id": "62f236de85b105008025d086", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "Such a blast!\r\n\r\nPersonally, I wasn't expecting much from <em>'Bullet Train'</em> at all. The (most overplayed) trailer didn't fill with me with much interest and I thought the bullet train aspect would be gimmicky and perhaps even too limiting. However, to my surprise it's the exact opposite to all that. It's supremely entertaining and very amusing!\r\n\r\nI love the whole style of the film, the editing is top notch. the bloody visuals are class and the music is superbly chosen - every track hits. Then you also have an excellent cast. I thought, again based on the trailer(s) that I saw, it would be a run-of-the-mill Brad Pitt feature, but his performance is terrific throughout.\r\n\r\nAaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry are a quality double act, I thought their accents and dynamic would get tiresome but if anything I enjoyed them the more I saw them - funny guys! Joey King was the only character I wasn't sold on during the film, though by the end I dug her performance too.\r\n\r\nAndrew Koji and Hiroyuki Sanada are also very good, while Michael Shannon, Benito A. Mart\u00ednez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) and Zazie Beetz are welcomed cast members as well. There are also a few other noteworthy people involved, including two that Pitt knows well from a different <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-city-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2022 flick</a>. Seriously, what a cast!\r\n\r\nIf I had to mention one gripe, it would be the run time/pacing - this is me nit-picking, though at like one or two (no more than that) moments I did feel like it wasn't paced incredibly. Again, no biggie though. All in all, I most definitely had a great time with this and would certainly recommend it.*\r\n\r\n*still, if you want an even greater film set entirely on a train then you gotta check out the outstanding <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/source-code/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source Code</a>'</em> - one of my favourites!", "created_at": "2022-08-09T10:28:46.968Z"}, {"movie_id": 718930, "review_id": "62fa1bb048333a0080423137", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Brad Pitt is \"Ladybug\" - a now zen-like, semi-retired, hitman brought out of retirement to appropriate a suitcase from a train. Easy enough task, you might think - especially as he obtains it relatively easily. It then transpires, though, that there is much more afoot. Also on the train are the two guys who own the suitcase - \"Lemon\" (Brian Tyree Henry) and his twin \"Tangerine\" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who have been tasked with rescuing the recently kidnapped son of the legendary \"White Death\" crime lord and his ransom (in the suitcase). When the pair discover that their loot has gone missing and that their charge has developed a rather nasty habit of bleeding from the eyes, they have to keep their suspicious employer at bay and find their luggage whilst this high-speed train hurtles from Tokyo to Kyoto. Add to the mix the slightly enigmatic \"Prince\" (Joey King) - outwardly a charming, butter-wouldn't-melt, schoolgirl type, but really a gal who is also up to something with the rather hapless \"Kimura\" (Andrew Kohi) whose son she had recently pushed from a roof and, well... Yes, the plot is pretty convoluted at the start but with a monologue style narrative well delivered by an on-form Pitt, and an engaging repartee between the 'Thomas the Tank Engine\" obsessed \"Lemon\" and his spiritual brother, this actually makes for quite a decent action adventure. It is way too long - it could comfortably shave twenty minutes from the character establishment phase, but the script is quickly paced and sometimes quite clever and there are plenty of action scenes that are fun to watch and don't take too long. It has shades of \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) I thought - multiple characters with entertaining storylines that gradually involve and synergise all the characters. The ending isn't the best, and perhaps one might wonder about the complete lack of security not just on the train but at just about every station between the two cities. Carnage ensues pretty readily but no sign of a blue light. It's fun, throwaway, entertainment that follows on from \"The Lost City\" in which Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum allow Pitt the supporting role that he allows to both of them - and a tiny but of Ryan Reynolds too, if you are eagle-eyed, here. It's factory fodder, and you won't remember it by Christmas - but it's still nice to see some folks having fun on a big screen with no pretence whatsoever.", "created_at": "2022-08-15T10:10:56.994Z"}, {"movie_id": 718930, "review_id": "6334a93f9ee0ef0083cfc7db", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "**Bullet Train combines all the action, expertise, and stunt work of John Wick with the pacing, goofiness, and fun of Hot Fuzz.**\r\n\r\nHigh energy, vibrant colors, funny characters, and excellent action fuel Bullet Train to take its audience on a wild and entertaining ride. Each character is larger than life and outrageous, but all fit perfectly in this vivid and comical world. Bullet Train feels like Edgar Wright\u2019s version of John Wick - all the action is there, but so are all the comedy and quirky characters.

The movie mixes action, comedy, a bit of suspense and a fair amount of gore in a quite enjoyable package.\r\n\r\nThe movie balances the comedy bits right on the line where it would turn silly and cringe-worthy but there was really only one place where I went \u201cOh no, what the f\u2026?\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe action bits are overall quite good but this is Hollywood with their armada of clueless script writers so sometimes they get a bit ridiculous.

Director David Leitch brings a confident, creative vision to his Guy Ritchie-meets-Gareth Evans-meets Matthew Vaughn-meets Quentin Tarantino style that\u2019s rambunctious, frenzied, and in your face. While some will detest this sort of mayhem, many fans of the genre will join me in enthusiastically screaming, \u201cshoot this into my veins!\u201c\r\n\r\nUnlucky assassin Ladybug (Brad Pitt) is tired of the brutality. He\u2019s back for another job, but has pledged to work peacefully and without a weapon. Ladybug has been tasked with retrieving a silver briefcase from a high-speed train in Japan, which seems simple enough. Fate steps in, naturally, putting a damper on his well-intentioned plans. The train is filled with the most lethal adversaries (and one deadly snake) from around the globe, and they all want the same thing. Chaos ensues in what may be a literal last man standing scenario.\r\n\r\nBased on the book by K\u00f4tar\u00f4 Isaka, the film takes place almost solely onboard a train, but it never feels claustrophobic. Despite tight close-ups and many dialogue-heavy scenes with questionable writing, the cast (including Joey King, Andrew Koji, Michael Shannon, and Hiroyuki Sanada) keeps things engaging. Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a pair of professional criminals are particularly entertaining, and Pitt exercises his movie star chops with great aplomb. The storytelling is terrific (one of my favorite bits is the tale of Wolf, which is wonderfully executed), even if everything doesn\u2019t quite come together as well as it could.\r\n\r\nThis is also a gorgeous looking film. Jonathan Sela\u2018s colorful cinematography is alluring, with a richness that elevates every scene. Leitch is skilled at directing action scenes that are thrilling, and fights that are well choreographed. Even the CGI is exciting.\r\n\r\nThe film reaches just the right balance between action, violence, and humor, and it\u2019s one that I cannot wait to revisit. From the killer soundtrack to the rapid-fire visual storytelling, there\u2019s a lot going on at all times. If you\u2019re not paying attention, you\u2019re guaranteed to miss something. I feel this one could benefit from subsequent viewings. Plus, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve wanted to rush back to re-watch a movie the second it ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cBullet Train\u201d is a film that will prove to be an acquired taste. It\u2019s the type of movie that you\u2019ll either love or loathe, with very few landing somewhere in between. It\u2019s illogical, confrontational, and it\u2019s sometimes evident that the film trying too hard, but I found it easy to overlook the flaws because it\u2019s just so damn entertaining.
