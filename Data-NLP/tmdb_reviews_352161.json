This is a crime-thriller-drama sets in the early 80s, Argentina, when democracy was restored in the nation. Focused on to tell a story of a middle class family called Puccios.

Also it the highest grossed film in the domestic circuit. No doubt the film was well made, especially the director who also managed well with the screenplay. This film can be watched to know the truth and nothing else, because of the negative message it carries. Nearly 100 minutes long, full of dark atmosphere, but among it there was a little romance.

Makes me to think only sick people would enjoy such films. It happened recently for a Chilean film 'The Club' that I felt disgust.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the filmmaking, but I feel this better should have been a documentary film. Anyway, that's my view. It was one side narration, covered everything from the family angle. But if it was told how the cops or the victim families coped would have made totally a different film. Then I might have liked it. So overall this film was okay, I'm not in its favor though.\r\n\r\n_6/10_", "created_at": "2016-12-14T21:22:14.448Z"}, {"movie_id": 352161, "review_id": "5851b806c3a3682fb801f078", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "**A family with the dark secret.**\r\n\r\nIt's right to say based on the real than a biopic, because it is not the film about the family who we inspire from their act.
