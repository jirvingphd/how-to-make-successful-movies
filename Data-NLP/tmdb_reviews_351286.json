The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary, but that\u2019s not the way it works out.\r\n\r\nMy title blurb pretty much says it all for this fifth film in the franchise. I mention Indiana Jones because the movie has a \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d (1981) vibe more so than the other movies. The reference to Dracula\u2019s castle is due to the fact that the entire second half takes place at a cool, gothic chateau in Northern California and there\u2019s a scene with a genetically-enhanced raptor acting like Dracula.\r\n\r\nCurvy Bryce is just stunning throughout and easily blows away any other woman in the series.
