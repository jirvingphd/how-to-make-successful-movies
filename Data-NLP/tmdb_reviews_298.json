I love the alternative motive of getting revenge for a friend, this way it's not about how much you can steal, its about how much you can make someone else lose, and it's against someone might be justifiably shot, not that it would help Reuben.\r\n\r\nThis movie gets every bit as complex with less over explaining than the last movie, keeping it fresh and interesting.\r\n\r\nAll the same production value, good cast, and good writing with new twists and angles.  A must see even if you've watched the first and are skipping the second.", "created_at": "2020-08-30T03:00:51.038Z"}]
