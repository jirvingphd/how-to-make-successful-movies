Specifically, this feature concerns US Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini (a very much on-form Jack O'Connell) who is recognised by a soldier (Watanabe) who was previously a competitor athlete, and who is now tasked with guarding him. Vengeful, he now proceeds to make his erstwhile rival's life a living hell. We, as an audience, are spared little of the brutality and cruelty imposed on Zamperini - and on the prisoners in general - and though physically and emotionally exhausted, we find ourselves witnessing an astonishing demonstration of determination and pride in the face of this mounting adversity. Amongst a solid supporting cast - Domnhall Gleeson and Garrett Hedlund are great, but Angelina Jolie really has managed to elicit the best from her two lead men here with Miyavi, as Watanabe, superbly menacing, but in an almost pathetic fashion.
