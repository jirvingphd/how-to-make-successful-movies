Bruce Dern is on hand as a lawyer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Glass House\u201d (2001) starts as a melancholic drama with the general plot, setting and tone of \u201cPoison Ivy\u201d (1992), but without the lethal Lolita angle. It eventually morphs into a suspense/thriller \u00e0 la \u201cEnough\u201d (2002), just don\u2019t expect Leelee to change into Rambo, like J-Lo.    \r\n\r\nSobieski as protagonist Ruby is one-dimensionally sullen, which fits the situation, but it gives a lifeless vibe to the proceedings. Some critics claim the last act is predictable, but it's really not, excepting the fact that two people ultimately square off (which is obvious from the beginning). I'd cite examples but don't want to give away spoilers.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in Malibu & that general area of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "created_at": "2019-08-07T20:12:03.857Z"}]
