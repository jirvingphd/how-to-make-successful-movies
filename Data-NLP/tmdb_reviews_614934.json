Was what I had just seen - colourful but frenetic and haphazard going to continue? Well, it does calm down - and continues to quite cleverly interweave the early years and aspirations of this young boy with the openly racist political situation that prevailed in the Southern United States in the early 1940s. From here on in, I am treating this as a provocative and entertaining but entirely speculative drama about this man. Historians always argue about what did happen - or what might have, and I haven't any factual insight to add. On that basis, this is a quickly paced and creatively structured depiction of the main points of the life of Elvis. Austin Butler has an uncanny resemblance. As was often said of Dustin Hoffman, it's a fine line between mimicry and acting, but here I think Butler is more in the latter corner. He puts enormous effort into this portrayal. Physically and emotionally he gives convincingly of his all, leaving us in no doubt as to the talents and raw charisma that drove Presley to sell more records than anyone else. History tells us that he was discovered, and that until his death he had a pretty turbulent relationship with his promoter - Col. Tom Parker (Tom Hanks). Hanks is fine, no better. His make up did distract me, especially as he aged, and his accent isn't the best; but he features surprisingly sparingly even if he is essentially relaying the narrative to us. Virtually all of this focusses on the excellent Butler as he demonstrates the highs and low of this man who ended up craving love and adulation as readily as anyone can crave drugs or booze (though he used his fair share of them too). I could have done with more flesh on the bones of his relationship with his mother and his wife, but the depictions of the parasitic hangers-on who continually bleed him dry leave us with a potent image of a not unintelligent man who brought pleasure to millions with his gyrating, his songs and his personality, but maybe didn't keep that much back for himself. It's planet Baz, so of course it is flamboyant and busy, the musical numbers are fluid and full of energy.

In the 1960s, while The Beatles and Rolling Stones were airborne across America, he was caught in a trap: starring in over 20 inane film projects. This allowed the rock n\u2019 roll revolution that centered on Elvis to pass him by. Ironically, this story and more were adapted to the screen last month in the biographical film, \u2018Elvis\u2019. The picture was directed by Baz Lurhmann (of \u2018Moulin Rouge!\u2019 and \u2018The Great Gatsby\u2019 fame) and stars newcomer Austin Butler as our favorite jailhouse rocker. It spans Presley\u2019s career entirely, but with a rigorous focus on the abusive relationship with his manager, \u201cColonel\u201d Tom Parker, played by Tom Hanks.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy theorists have been right all this time. Elvis Presley is alive and well, but young, thirty, and goes by the name of Austin Butler\u2026or at least that\u2019s what I saw on the screen. I can\u2019t praise Butler enough, let alone give him the justice he deserves in this paragraph, so I recommend you keep an eye out for him this next awards season. I am of the adamant opinion that there are three different Elvis Presleys: 50s rock star, 60s movie star, and 70s icon. All three act and move so, so unalike, and Austin understood and played them all. The movie is almost sequenced in this way: giving all three Elvises (Elvi?) their own hour to portray themselves. Similar praises are in order to Helen Thompson, who plays Elvis\u2019 mother, Gladys Presley, and Alton Mason who plays Little Richard, who I wish we would\u2019ve seen more of. The first quarter of the movie is set in the late-1950s, around Elvis\u2019 rise to fame, and a majority of these scenes, especially the few that have Elvis and Gladys conversing about what lies ahead for the both of them, are so tonally gripping and devastating. Every director has a style, whether that be the calculated darkness of Alfred Hitchcock or Michael Bay\u2019s explosions-a-plenty. Baz Luhrmann\u2019s is simply vehement extravagance. I can\u2019t praise his art direction throughout the film enough. Whether it\u2019s the set design, costume design, or the way Austin melts the camera lens whenever he\u2019s on-screen, Baz Luhrmann\u2019s presence is always intensely felt, especially if you\u2019re familiar with his past work. Luhrmann also co-wrote the screenplay, which continues to make me feel as though he was the perfect man for this job.  While your \u2018Bohemian Rhapsodies\u2019 will play \u2018Another One Bites The Dust\u2019 at the drop of any hat, \u2018Elvis\u2019 earns every music queue. It doesn\u2019t just use the music, the film reexamines it. Tones in goofy, throw-away songs, like \u2018Cotton Candy Land\u2019 and \u2018Power of My Love\u2019, are completely overhauled and turned into life-defining theme songs for these real life characters. New songs, such as \u2018Vegas\u2018 by Doja Cat, \u2018Tupelo Shuffle\u2018 by Swae Lee with Diplo, and \u2018Let It All Hang Out\u2018 by Denzel Curry also have this same sense of extravagance, electrifying every scene they\u2019re in. One track that I thought was used beautifully and like never before was the iconic \u2018Unchained Melody\u2019, which had the audience ready to sob on the theater floor every time I saw the film on its opening weekend.\r\n\r\nTruthfully, there was not much that I didn\u2019t overwhelmingly enjoy. At around two hours and forty minutes, the runtime may be a little much for the average viewer. I\u2019ve come to the determination that, yes, it\u2019s long, but not too long. Nothing in the almost three hours could be lost without the story (and the emotional significance of its payoff) being affected drastically. The story flows like a puzzle, with every piece being important to understand the full picture. Baz states that there\u2019s a four-hour cut somewhere in the archive and while he says it will most likely never see the light of day, I believe it. When it comes to time, though, I hate that we didn\u2019t spend more time in the period where Elvis was forced to make those truly terrible films of the 1960s. You can feel the importance of this wasted time in Elvis\u2019 life, but it\u2019s not explicitly shown and might leave those unfamiliar addled. Our introduction to Elvis\u2019 longtime wife, Priscilla Presley, was quite weak as well, as we never really see them meet. She\u2019s just kind of\u2026there. Sure, she\u2019s not integral to the main story (that of Elvis and the Colonel), but not having your two romantic leads meet is surely a bold choice. Tom Hanks as Tom Parker is something I would have portrayed differently as well. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people online refer to him as \u201ccartoonish\u201d and, when I saw the film with \u2018Sabor Latino\u2019 host Cristopher Loya, he could only compare Hanks\u2019 performance to Jared Leto\u2019s ridiculous portrayal of Paolo Gucci in 2021\u2019s laughable \u2018House of Gucci\u2019. I have to agree. This cunning, evil businessman should have been lurking in the shadows of Elvis\u2019 story, not ridiculously running around and laughing through halls with a cane. I feel like I\u2019m watching Cesar Romero\u2019s Joker compared to Heath Ledger\u2019s. This is not to say it\u2019s a terrible performance, which it isn\u2019t, but simply succeeded in portraying a different idea than I would have liked it to.   \r\n\r\nElvis Presley means so many different things to so many different people. As a man, he is portrayed truthfully here, with very little being held back. The climax of the movie, based around Elvis\u2019 1968 NBC television special, often referred to as \u201cThe Comeback\u201d, shows the man grasping with mortality and relevancy with the undervalued song, \u2018If I Can Dream\u2019. This scene specifically says a lot about how the film and its crew feel about Elvis Presley, whether it\u2019s the tears in Austin Butler\u2019s eyes as he belts out the song, the camera\u2019s intricate zoom on the Colonel watching Elvis from the background, or Baz Lurhmann\u2019s distortion of the background with magazine articles, showing us how the world thought at the time. It\u2019s almost an enhanced stage play with thick, thoughtful dialogue throughout. I very much enjoyed the film and it places high in my favorites of all time. While Elton John\u2019s \u2018Rocketman\u2019 might still be my reigning, defending biopic champion, second place isn\u2019t too shabby at all. The powers that be all came together to make this one, great cinematic experience that the entire family will be able to enjoy and appreciate.

Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a bit too long for comfort, and towards the end, it starts to lose its momentum, leading to an unsatisfying finish.

With early rock stars or those living that lifestyle, overdoses often did them in. But With the likes of Judy Garland and Elvis, it was prescription drugs that slowly caused their lives to ebb away. A sad story in many ways. I would have liked to see him more as a father and husband. But the acting, writing and the story of his musical journey was enough to keep me interested.

His portrayal is likely to earn him much-deserved accolades during the awards season.\r\n\r\nHowever, the film does have its flaws. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a bit too long for comfort, and towards the end, it starts to lose its momentum, leading to an unsatisfying finish. Additionally, the film's over-the-top and extravagant visual style, while suitable for the musical numbers, can become burdensome and distracting during the quieter moments.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the film's narrator and one of its most prominent actors, Tom Hanks, gives a surprisingly disappointing performance. His prosthetics often look like they're falling off, and his accent is distracting and difficult to get used to. This issue is compounded by the fact that he's the narrator, which means he's present throughout much of the movie, causing some frustration and annoyance.\r\n\r\nDespite its shortcomings, Elvis is still an enjoyable and informative movie that provides an excellent window into the life of a musical icon.

Biographical films about rock stars have something traditional.

Was what I had just seen - colourful but frenetic and haphazard going to continue? Well, it does calm down - and continues to quite cleverly interweave the early years and aspirations of this young boy with the openly racist political situation that prevailed in the Southern United States in the early 1940s. From here on in, I am treating this as a provocative and entertaining but entirely speculative drama about this man. Historians always argue about what did happen - or what might have, and I haven't any factual insight to add. On that basis, this is a quickly paced and creatively structured depiction of the main points of the life of Elvis. Austin Butler has an uncanny resemblance. As was often said of Dustin Hoffman, it's a fine line between mimicry and acting, but here I think Butler is more in the latter corner. He puts enormous effort into this portrayal. Physically and emotionally he gives convincingly of his all, leaving us in no doubt as to the talents and raw charisma that drove Presley to sell more records than anyone else. History tells us that he was discovered, and that until his death he had a pretty turbulent relationship with his promoter - Col. Tom Parker (Tom Hanks). Hanks is fine, no better. His make up did distract me, especially as he aged, and his accent isn't the best; but he features surprisingly sparingly even if he is essentially relaying the narrative to us. Virtually all of this focusses on the excellent Butler as he demonstrates the highs and low of this man who ended up craving love and adulation as readily as anyone can crave drugs or booze (though he used his fair share of them too). I could have done with more flesh on the bones of his relationship with his mother and his wife, but the depictions of the parasitic hangers-on who continually bleed him dry leave us with a potent image of a not unintelligent man who brought pleasure to millions with his gyrating, his songs and his personality, but maybe didn't keep that much back for himself.

In the 1960s, while The Beatles and Rolling Stones were airborne across America, he was caught in a trap: starring in over 20 inane film projects. This allowed the rock n\u2019 roll revolution that centered on Elvis to pass him by. Ironically, this story and more were adapted to the screen last month in the biographical film, \u2018Elvis\u2019. The picture was directed by Baz Lurhmann (of \u2018Moulin Rouge!\u2019 and \u2018The Great Gatsby\u2019 fame) and stars newcomer Austin Butler as our favorite jailhouse rocker. It spans Presley\u2019s career entirely, but with a rigorous focus on the abusive relationship with his manager, \u201cColonel\u201d Tom Parker, played by Tom Hanks.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy theorists have been right all this time. Elvis Presley is alive and well, but young, thirty, and goes by the name of Austin Butler\u2026or at least that\u2019s what I saw on the screen. I can\u2019t praise Butler enough, let alone give him the justice he deserves in this paragraph, so I recommend you keep an eye out for him this next awards season. I am of the adamant opinion that there are three different Elvis Presleys: 50s rock star, 60s movie star, and 70s icon. All three act and move so, so unalike, and Austin understood and played them all. The movie is almost sequenced in this way: giving all three Elvises (Elvi?) their own hour to portray themselves. Similar praises are in order to Helen Thompson, who plays Elvis\u2019 mother, Gladys Presley, and Alton Mason who plays Little Richard, who I wish we would\u2019ve seen more of. The first quarter of the movie is set in the late-1950s, around Elvis\u2019 rise to fame, and a majority of these scenes, especially the few that have Elvis and Gladys conversing about what lies ahead for the both of them, are so tonally gripping and devastating. Every director has a style, whether that be the calculated darkness of Alfred Hitchcock or Michael Bay\u2019s explosions-a-plenty. Baz Luhrmann\u2019s is simply vehement extravagance. I can\u2019t praise his art direction throughout the film enough. Whether it\u2019s the set design, costume design, or the way Austin melts the camera lens whenever he\u2019s on-screen, Baz Luhrmann\u2019s presence is always intensely felt, especially if you\u2019re familiar with his past work. Luhrmann also co-wrote the screenplay, which continues to make me feel as though he was the perfect man for this job.  While your \u2018Bohemian Rhapsodies\u2019 will play \u2018Another One Bites The Dust\u2019 at the drop of any hat, \u2018Elvis\u2019 earns every music queue. It doesn\u2019t just use the music, the film reexamines it. Tones in goofy, throw-away songs, like \u2018Cotton Candy Land\u2019 and \u2018Power of My Love\u2019, are completely overhauled and turned into life-defining theme songs for these real life characters. New songs, such as \u2018Vegas\u2018 by Doja Cat, \u2018Tupelo Shuffle\u2018 by Swae Lee with Diplo, and \u2018Let It All Hang Out\u2018 by Denzel Curry also have this same sense of extravagance, electrifying every scene they\u2019re in. One track that I thought was used beautifully and like never before was the iconic \u2018Unchained Melody\u2019, which had the audience ready to sob on the theater floor every time I saw the film on its opening weekend.\r\n\r\nTruthfully, there was not much that I didn\u2019t overwhelmingly enjoy. At around two hours and forty minutes, the runtime may be a little much for the average viewer. I\u2019ve come to the determination that, yes, it\u2019s long, but not too long. Nothing in the almost three hours could be lost without the story (and the emotional significance of its payoff) being affected drastically. The story flows like a puzzle, with every piece being important to understand the full picture. Baz states that there\u2019s a four-hour cut somewhere in the archive and while he says it will most likely never see the light of day, I believe it. When it comes to time, though, I hate that we didn\u2019t spend more time in the period where Elvis was forced to make those truly terrible films of the 1960s. You can feel the importance of this wasted time in Elvis\u2019 life, but it\u2019s not explicitly shown and might leave those unfamiliar addled. Our introduction to Elvis\u2019 longtime wife, Priscilla Presley, was quite weak as well, as we never really see them meet. She\u2019s just kind of\u2026there. Sure, she\u2019s not integral to the main story (that of Elvis and the Colonel), but not having your two romantic leads meet is surely a bold choice. Tom Hanks as Tom Parker is something I would have portrayed differently as well. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people online refer to him as \u201ccartoonish\u201d and, when I saw the film with \u2018Sabor Latino\u2019 host Cristopher Loya, he could only compare Hanks\u2019 performance to Jared Leto\u2019s ridiculous portrayal of Paolo Gucci in 2021\u2019s laughable \u2018House of Gucci\u2019. I have to agree. This cunning, evil businessman should have been lurking in the shadows of Elvis\u2019 story, not ridiculously running around and laughing through halls with a cane. I feel like I\u2019m watching Cesar Romero\u2019s Joker compared to Heath Ledger\u2019s. This is not to say it\u2019s a terrible performance, which it isn\u2019t, but simply succeeded in portraying a different idea than I would have liked it to.   \r\n\r\nElvis Presley means so many different things to so many different people. As a man, he is portrayed truthfully here, with very little being held back. The climax of the movie, based around Elvis\u2019 1968 NBC television special, often referred to as \u201cThe Comeback\u201d, shows the man grasping with mortality and relevancy with the undervalued song, \u2018If I Can Dream\u2019. This scene specifically says a lot about how the film and its crew feel about Elvis Presley, whether it\u2019s the tears in Austin Butler\u2019s eyes as he belts out the song, the camera\u2019s intricate zoom on the Colonel watching Elvis from the background, or Baz Lurhmann\u2019s distortion of the background with magazine articles, showing us how the world thought at the time. It\u2019s almost an enhanced stage play with thick, thoughtful dialogue throughout. I very much enjoyed the film and it places high in my favorites of all time. While Elton John\u2019s \u2018Rocketman\u2019 might still be my reigning, defending biopic champion, second place isn\u2019t too shabby at all. The powers that be all came together to make this one, great cinematic experience that the entire family will be able to enjoy and appreciate.

You can feel the importance of this wasted time in Elvis\u2019 life, but it\u2019s not explicitly shown and might leave those unfamiliar addled. Our introduction to Elvis\u2019 longtime wife, Priscilla Presley, was quite weak as well, as we never really see them meet. She\u2019s just kind of\u2026there. Sure, she\u2019s not integral to the main story (that of Elvis and the Colonel), but not having your two romantic leads meet is surely a bold choice. Tom Hanks as Tom Parker is something I would have portrayed differently as well. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people online refer to him as \u201ccartoonish\u201d and, when I saw the film with \u2018Sabor Latino\u2019 host Cristopher Loya, he could only compare Hanks\u2019 performance to Jared Leto\u2019s ridiculous portrayal of Paolo Gucci in 2021\u2019s laughable \u2018House of Gucci\u2019. I have to agree. This cunning, evil businessman should have been lurking in the shadows of Elvis\u2019 story, not ridiculously running around and laughing through halls with a cane. I feel like I\u2019m watching Cesar Romero\u2019s Joker compared to Heath Ledger\u2019s. This is not to say it\u2019s a terrible performance, which it isn\u2019t, but simply succeeded in portraying a different idea than I would have liked it to.   \r\n\r\nElvis Presley means so many different things to so many different people. As a man, he is portrayed truthfully here, with very little being held back. The climax of the movie, based around Elvis\u2019 1968 NBC television special, often referred to as \u201cThe Comeback\u201d, shows the man grasping with mortality and relevancy with the undervalued song, \u2018If I Can Dream\u2019. This scene specifically says a lot about how the film and its crew feel about Elvis Presley, whether it\u2019s the tears in Austin Butler\u2019s eyes as he belts out the song, the camera\u2019s intricate zoom on the Colonel watching Elvis from the background, or Baz Lurhmann\u2019s distortion of the background with magazine articles, showing us how the world thought at the time. It\u2019s almost an enhanced stage play with thick, thoughtful dialogue throughout. I very much enjoyed the film and it places high in my favorites of all time. While Elton John\u2019s \u2018Rocketman\u2019 might still be my reigning, defending biopic champion, second place isn\u2019t too shabby at all. The powers that be all came together to make this one, great cinematic experience that the entire family will be able to enjoy and appreciate.

But a biopic is only as great as the leading actor carrying this film and I glad to report that Austin Butler absolutely nailed this role. Fantastic through and through.

I had heard that the man who called himself Colonel Parker had forced songwriters to give Presley writing credits before he would let him perform their songs, but I had never dug deep enough to learn how badly he was duping his own client and supposed friend.\r\n\r\nAnd as often seems to happen with celebrities with fame and money, drugs appear to have shortened Elvis\u2019s life. With early rock stars or those living that lifestyle, overdoses often did them in. But With the likes of Judy Garland and Elvis, it was prescription drugs that slowly caused their lives to ebb away. A sad story in many ways. I would have liked to see him more as a father and husband. But the acting, writing and the story of his musical journey was enough to keep me interested. It was funny, but when they related at the end the postscripts to the lives, their description of Colonel Parker\u2019s final years seemed designed to elicit pity or \u201dserves him right.\u201d But in a weird way, I wonder if her was content powering down his life in Vegas gambling his fortune away.

Austin Butler delivers an outstanding performance as Elvis, effortlessly capturing the essence of the legendary artist from start to finish. His portrayal is likely to earn him much-deserved accolades during the awards season.\r\n\r\nHowever, the film does have its flaws. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a bit too long for comfort, and towards the end, it starts to lose its momentum, leading to an unsatisfying finish. Additionally, the film's over-the-top and extravagant visual style, while suitable for the musical numbers, can become burdensome and distracting during the quieter moments.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the film's narrator and one of its most prominent actors, Tom Hanks, gives a surprisingly disappointing performance. His prosthetics often look like they're falling off, and his accent is distracting and difficult to get used to. This issue is compounded by the fact that he's the narrator, which means he's present throughout much of the movie, causing some frustration and annoyance.\r\n\r\nDespite its shortcomings, Elvis is still an enjoyable and informative movie that provides an excellent window into the life of a musical icon. While it may not be perfect, there are certainly enough high points to warrant a watch, making it worth a solid 6/10 rating.", "created_at": "2023-02-23T17:54:12.654Z"}, {"movie_id": 614934, "review_id": "64fe27a16a222701372c427b", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "**amazing, beautiful and shocking movie**\r\n\r\n I didn't expect that I would like the movie in this way because I have no interest in the singer Elvis Bresley because I have never heard his songs. All I know is that he is a rock and roll legend. I had no interest or any attachment to this character, but the movie made me admire his true personality.\r\n\r\nThat was so magical with all the beauty of the story and it really hurt my heart. Biographical films about rock stars have something traditional. You see at the beginning of the movies as the hero of the true story he was humble and then you see his rise to the top and his attachment to drugs and his love for women until the end. This movie has this characteristic as well, but the film's direction by Baz Luhrmann was frankly excellent as it had a rhythm The film is fast-paced. It is difficult to take a break between the movie because the rhythm of the film was fast.\r\n\r\nEverything was fast until I realized that the story of Elvis could be turned into a series with several episodes, 7 or 8, but when the story was turned into a movie, the events of his life story were transformed into an incredibly fast frame.
