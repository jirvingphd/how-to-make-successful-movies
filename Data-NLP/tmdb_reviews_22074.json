Seriously, this is an important slice of current American history.\r\n\r\nBetter than anything else this highlights a total 180 on labor for both the left and the right... and it's only 10 years old.\r\n\r\nNike, yeah, they make a big deal out of how the company moved abroad and now operates sweat shops... that was a left wing issue 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nAnd today the left will attack anyone that criticizes Nike as \"racist.\"\r\n\r\nBut it goes beyond that. 10 years ago it was the left that thought outsourcing was bad, and that spoke out against major corporations that did it. Now it's the right that is speaking out against outsourcing... and, well, they are BOTH championing enormous corporations. In fact, the left would call any protection of domestic labor from outsourcing \"nationalism\" and \"racist.\"\r\n\r\nAt least that was something the right is, unfortunately, consistent on... but the left will all but nail you to the cross if you say anything about Disney, Nike, Google, Apple, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the plight of Middle America, that was something that both sides could at least pay lip-service to, but in 2019... the argument on the left has turned that all of Middle America (save, Chicago and, maybe parts of Colorado) are absolute evil and full of people in white hoods.\r\n\r\nThis stands as a shining example of how fast things change in only one short decade.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T02:31:07.656Z"}]
