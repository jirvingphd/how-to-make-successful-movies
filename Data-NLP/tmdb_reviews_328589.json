I was talking about Maggie Smith, she's 82 years old and still her performances can compete with younger generation actors. The story was narrated from someone's perspective about the role she played, that's why it's little weakened, otherwise if she was in solo, it would have been an Oscar worthy. Incidentally, that someone was an actual writer, so the film ended up portraying her very well, beside himself.\r\n\r\nInspired by the real story of an old lady who lived in a van for the 15 years during the 70s in the London's residential driveways. This film tells the mystery behind the state of her condition and actions. Actually, I expected it to be like 'Little Miss Sunshine', a road film, but after learning it was a biopic I am impressed with the overall movie.\r\n\r\nAn heartfully enjoyable comedy-drama with a small suspense in the plot. In fact, the whole film developed pretty well because of the opening event that hidden from us to reveal at the conclusion. It was a bit of fantasy as well, especially the end was too much of it.\r\n\r\nOn the Mary Shepard character, it reminded me Mrs. Julia Wicket from the Mr. Bean's animated series. Similar kind of attitude like don't care about others, especially when everyone around her showing some kind of respect and care, she was more a sceptical for us. The film was shot in the real locations. That was an advantage for filmmaking, and for us to witness from very close to the original.\r\n\r\n8/10", "created_at": "2016-05-04T14:04:43.052Z"}]
