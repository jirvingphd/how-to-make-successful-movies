What I meant was Jackie Chan teaming up with an American star. Though all those films are almost same, like running and chasing and stunts with the comedic sense. Yep, totally boring, nothing new it it, except different locations and the cast. The Russians addition was new, but in the end it became a joke. That's funny to say, because it is a comedy film.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with Jackie Chan's Hollywood films, then you already know the 90 per cent of this film and for the rest, you have to watch it. A cop from Hong Kong seeking a revenge for his partner's death, so now he has to find and rescue the American con man who stuck with the Russias gangster for the evidence he needed to put the criminal gang boss behind the bar. The adventurous journey they take across the Mongolia is what the film is based on.\r\n\r\nThis film is specially made for the yuan market, so don't bother if you don't carry yuan in your wallet. Maybe Renny Harlin's worst film I've ever seen. Jackie Chan is the only reason to watch it, but surely you have seen better films of his than this. Johnny Knoxville was just okay and the rest of the cast does not look good. Rewatching 'Shanghai Noon' and 'Rush Hours' films is better than this, so I'm not in favour of it.\r\n\r\n_4/10_", "created_at": "2016-11-04T21:07:25.022Z"}]
