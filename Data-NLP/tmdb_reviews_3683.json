As a whole I was very interested in it, individually I don't think it's as strong but as a collective it comes out nicely. Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach are the pick of the performers, though there are a load of familiar faces elsewhere - including Paul Walker, John Slattery and Jamie Bell.\r\n\r\nSuper intrigued to check out <em>'Letters from Iwo Jima'</em>, which Clint Eastwood & Co. released two months after this to serve as a companion piece. Hopefully that's as good as this.", "created_at": "2022-02-09T22:22:58.409Z"}]
