I'm gonna count it.\r\n\r\n<em>'Valiant'</em> is a little hit-and-miss, however I think it just about makes for good viewing. The animation is, honestly, kinda crappy, though there are moments where it does look more than decent.\r\n\r\nThe plot is mostly predictable but I do actually quite like it, as it tells a story about war pigeons from WWII. It is amusing for the majority, even if the characters are strangely overtly horny too much.\r\n\r\nThe strongest part of this film is easily the cast, who are very good. Ricky Gervais (Bugsy) is the best voice on show, he is the ideal actor to play that role. There are many other familiar voices: Ewan McGregor (Valiant), John Cleese (Mercury), Jim Broadbent (Monty), Hugh Laurie (Gutsy) and Tim Curry (Von Talon); as well as one or two others. McGregor is largely positive, even if he does get a tad too sappy in parts.\r\n\r\nI can see why this splits opinion, I truly can. However, it entertained me just enough and it isn't one I mind rewatching to be frank.", "created_at": "2020-08-04T17:57:19.736Z"}]
