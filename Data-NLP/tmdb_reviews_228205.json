The cast was good, especially I love anything with Britt Roberson. The film had dual layer narration, one being set during the 40s onwards and the other was the present time tale.

The film should have been a lot better, only if it was a bit emotionalised, which is very essential for a theme like this. I thought the final scene was cliche, but after waiting for a few more seconds, I relieved for changing its course in the final minute to conclude decently. The drawback was the length of the narration and the overall slow pace, other than that mostly you won't end up disappointed with this.
