David Yarovesky clearly drew inspiration from Zack Snyder\u2019s version (Man of Steel), and that\u2019s where the movie is best: in exploring the vast and interesting possibilities that a screenplay like this can pursue.\r\n\r\nUsually, when someone writes something along the lines of \u201cit felt like two movies\u201d, it\u2019s not a good sign. Brightburn is a dark, mysterious and suspenseful film during the first half, but then it pretty much transforms itself into a horror-slasher flick, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. I firmly believe that no audience member (and I would even dare write critics as well) will leave the theater completely satisfied or entirely disappointed. If you expected the Gunn family to delve deep into Superman\u2019s mythology and explore some twisty paths, they do rely on classic scenes to show how it all could have been if \u201cClark Kent\u201d wasn\u2019t a nice boy.\r\n\r\nIf you were expecting a movie closer to the horror genre, the last half of the film offers some good sequences. However, that\u2019s when the movie loses what made me go watch it in the first place. It\u2019s a very short film and it ends in a way that leaves me wanting more. The big problem here is that it\u2019s likely not going to get a sequel, and it could have easily added extra 20-30 minutes to deliver a more fulfilled story.\r\n\r\nProduction-wise, having in mind its low budget, it looks remarkably great. Some good moments of gorgeous cinematography, and beautiful wide shots. The jump scare sequences of the second half aren\u2019t nearly as effective as they could be, but at least the editing throughout the entire runtime is seamless. With a few more creative and entertaining scenes, Brightburn could have been a lot more menacing and scarier. I only remembered it was R-rated once the first bloody and quite violent moment occurs, and these specific moments are definitely eye-opening, gruesome and horrifying, even though it gets too over-the-top a couple of times.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Banks (Tori Breyer) delivers a notable performance, as well as David Denman (Kyle Breyer). Their characters have a compelling backstory, and they actually have a well-developed script. They don\u2019t make dumb or irrational decisions, like the generic horror characters that we all recognize. Jackson A. Dunn (Brandon) is pretty good as the evil Superman, even if his performance ends up being too monotonous for me. Looking at the overall feedback from both critics and audience, this seems to be part of those rare films each year which I enjoy a bit more than most people.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Brightburn doesn\u2019t take off powerfully like Superman, but it\u2019s still able to fly for a bit. With good performances, remarkable production design, and an adequate use of its R-rating, the Gunn family delivers an incredibly captivating concept which is explored through an interesting yet unfulfilling screenplay. The second half turns the movie into a pure slasher flick, which might positively affect some viewers, but for me it took away what was really entertaining. The ending is just a taste of what the film could have been and it\u2019s disappointing that it doesn\u2019t explore its fantastic idea more in-depth, but the final feeling about the movie isn\u2019t too bad either.\r\n\r\nRating: B", "created_at": "2019-08-21T11:01:45.703Z"}, {"movie_id": 531309, "review_id": "5d6e197165686e52e7882af4", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Given that the premise of the movie is pretty much entirely \"What if Superman was a dick?\" (something that has already been explored pretty thoroughly by DC themselves) I did not expect so much of the focus of the film to be taken up by the family dynamix inherent in the difficulties of parenting.\r\n\r\nA pretty mismarketed movie I think.
