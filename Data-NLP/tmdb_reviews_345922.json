He did not get the best cast, but best among the second string. Charlie Day's first lead I'm seeing. I mean not like, among other big stars he used to do the roles. Yes, there are like Ice Cube in the film, but the whole narration was presented from the Charlie's viewpoint. This story needed strong voice, but he had none. You may get annoyed for that, but that's the first fun side of the tale. Charlie Day versus Ice Cube! This kind of combination is not new, but decently used to tell the story. I like Cube in comedies than the serious roles.\r\n\r\nWell, it's not about the story, it's just a one day event. The final day of the school and a tough day for all. Because some of the staffs were fired from the job, the students' misconduct peaked, it's totally a messy day. The English teacher, Campbell, gets into a fight for going against his co-staff. So the day goes on as the countdown begins for their most anticipated fight at the final bell of the school. The preparation for that and all other craziness take place before the finale.\r\n\r\nWhen the film started, it was like any other B movie, very familiar atmosphere and predictable. Once the second half kick-started, I felt it was getting better. And the climax was even better. So, it ended strongly, after a so-so opening. Till that end, I did not think it deserved a decent respect, but at the end a better one. With this kind of cast and thematic, the film was much better. Really a well made, nothing more than on the entertainment perspective. So, if that's your sole purpose to watch a film, then this is the right one. Go for it. A much better film than the rating it had received. #TeachersFight\r\n\r\n_7/10_", "created_at": "2017-09-16T20:56:15.288Z"}, {"movie_id": 345922, "review_id": "5e2f29db4ca676001a49ba92", "author_rating": 2.0, "review_text": "I'm guessing Jason Bateman wasn't available for this.", "created_at": "2020-01-27T18:20:11.981Z"}, {"movie_id": 345922, "review_id": "6463c6f68c44b9780af2ba48", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Funny movie with 2 teachers that can't seem to get along.
