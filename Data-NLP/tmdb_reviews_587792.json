[{"movie_id": 587792, "review_id": "5eff72de9dee580038d24559", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIf you've been following me for a while, you know I'm not the biggest fan of rom-coms. It's not that I don't like the genre (I appreciate and enjoy every single one), but I find its movies tremendously difficult to *really* love. The massive majority follow the genre's formulas and cliches to such an extent that I rarely end up truly loving one of these films. Some are way too cheesy. Others are way too unrealistic and dream-like. But the aspect that throws me off the most is the lack of originality. I can't remember the last rom-com I watched that didn't borrow from countless other installments. I didn't know a thing about Palm Springs: no trailers, no knowledge of critics/audience's opinion, nothing... And I'm extremely happy about that!\r\n\r\nI usually watch the main trailer for every film I review *after* I've seen the actual movie. I ignore all other trailers, clips, images, and so on. I do this so I can have some sort of knowledge regarding how far I can take my spoiler-free reviews. This way, I'm sure that I don't write about something I shouldn't. The official trailer for this film doesn't ruin the experience in any way, but it does tell its viewers the most relevant aspect of its screenplay. So, I could address it in this review, but I won't... because I enjoyed this movie a lot more, not knowing a thing about it than if I knew how it developed its story.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I'll keep it really vague, and just write that Andy Siara's first feature-film screenplay can easily snatch a couple of nominations when the awards season comes around. This is a rom-com like no other due to its refreshingly unique concept. It's true that it's not an entirely new method of storytelling. Many other movies also employ this idea, but Siara holds so many surprises within his narrative and so few of the genre's common traits that the whole film is elevated by his outstanding writing.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the most entertaining movies of the year. With a short runtime and a fast pace, Palm Springs is constantly being genuinely fun, engaging, and even mysteriously intriguing. Its original plot makes the viewer think and remember previous lines that take a whole different meaning a few minutes later. There are no predictably dumb narrative decisions, and its characters escape the cheesy and forced relationships that these films usually insert them in. The dialogues are hilariously captivating. Almost every single plot point packs an emotional punch, a jaw-dropping revelation that never crossed the viewer's mind.\r\n\r\nAndy Samberg and Cristin Milioti share such great chemistry. Their characters are exceptionally developed, and their relationship feels incredibly real. I'm rarely that viewer who requires the main characters to be together, kiss, fall in love, and all that, but Nyles and Sarah are two wonderful protagonists I can definitely root for. Both carry an interesting \"baggage\", which is also explored at a deep level. They deal very differently with the \"situation\" that the story puts them in, and it's so much fun to watch them go through it and evolve as characters. Oh, and J.K. Simmons (Roy)... this man doesn't know how not to be utterly remarkable!\r\n\r\nMax Barbakow (directorial debut) demonstrates his talents as well, by allowing Siara's screenplay to shine under impeccable direction. Tonally, it never loses its balance. It keeps its comedy pretty grounded, considering the craziness of its premise. It never relies on the genre's formulas, cliches, and cheesy outcomes. It really separates itself from the majority of modern rom-coms. I don't really have any flaws to point out... The ending does have a \"just accept it\" narrative component, and there are a couple of unnecessary scenes, but I'm nitpicking here.\r\n\r\nI can't believe I'm going to write this, but Palm Springs is not only one of the best rom-coms I've ever seen, but it's also one of the best (if not *the* best) movies of 2020, so far. With the help of their first-time director (Max Barbakow), Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti spread their extraordinary chemistry all over the innovative, original narrative, written by the also debutant, Andy Siara. The latter is undoubtedly the main responsible for such an entertaining film. Siara takes an imaginative concept and develops it in the most captivating, fun, hilarious, and even intriguing way possible. A surprising screenplay packed with emotionally impactful plot points, revelations, and twists that keep the enjoyment levels extremely high. The two protagonists are exceptionally developed, as well as their compelling relationship. With a fast pace and a perfect balance of its tone, Palm Springs sets itself apart from the other movies of the genre, staying away from all of the cliches, formulas, and stereotypes associated with it. J.K. Simmons also lends his awesomeness because why not? Whether you're a fan of rom-coms or not, I definitely suggest giving this one a look.

Cristin Milioti (How I Met Your Mother) does an excellent job in her lead role, with a great supporting cast, to include J.K. Simmons (Cave Johnson) leading a wonderful supporting cast, except for Tyler Hoechlin (CW Superman: \"Supergirl\", \"Flash\", etc.), who I might just not like because he was Superman, but it's supposed to be an disliked character...so....good job?\r\n\r\nThe medium of the transfer being shown is an interesting option as we saw in the \"Happy Death Day\" movies, but it does allow for a reasoning of how it works, can it be broken / manipulated as opposed to divine will.  Most importantly, it allows for more than just one subject being affected, which is really where it gets set apart.\r\n\r\nThe trope bleeds a little when you have multiple people trapped in the loop: you have multiple people trapped in a thing: you have multiple people trapped in a prison.  When multiple people are trapped in a environment together, they tend to get a little strange, and we get that sort of thing a plenty.  Because we have multiple story threads to follow, we're almost seeing 3 stories all overlapping, and the movie does a great job of showing those, whether or not their in chronological order, or happening at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhether you see it as a prison break movie, or a time loop movie, this movie has a lot of fun in it, along with deep metaphysical philosophy, so there is something for everyone.", "created_at": "2020-07-22T12:16:33.276Z"}, {"movie_id": 587792, "review_id": "5f2b1ce6d8cc4a0038210f5e", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "This is a reimagining of Groundhog Day, but I think it stands pretty well on its own merits.

There was enough difference between each of the replays of the day that it didn\u2019t feel like, here we go again with 90% of the same stuff happening with a slight change thrown in.\r\n\r\nSo it was an entertaining movie overall. It isn\u2019t one that I will watch multiple times, but if the opportunity arises to watch it again, say with someone who hasn\u2019t seen it, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate.

The film, written by Andy Siara and directed by Max Barbakow, is a weird hipster version of \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d with a story about two semi-dorks stuck in an infinite loop where they must relive the same sunrise to sunset over and over again.\r\n\r\nNovember 9th is the perfect date for a Palm Springs destination wedding, and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) is there for her younger sister\u2019s big day. The elder sibling has a real chip on her shoulder, reluctant to serve as the maid of honor and not a big fan of formal events. At the reception, she meets Nyles (Andy Samberg), a carefree dude who is trapped with his shallow, cheating, bridesmaid girlfriend Misty (Meredith Hagner).\r\n\r\nSarah and Nyles hit it off with their shared offbeat sense of humor, and the duo sneak off into the desert for a late-night rendezvous. Something really, really weird interrupts their plans, turning the two into a powerhouse of cynical anarchy when they discover they\u2019re able to endlessly reprise that day.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fun idea that\u2019s given a refresh with smart-aleck humor from Milioti and Samberg. They\u2019re a charismatic pair, even if they\u2019re not the easiest couple to root for. The film has a jaded, \u201ctoo cool for school\u201d angle that may turn off some viewers, but it tries to remain lighthearted. An all-too-brief supporting turn from J.K.

Cristin Milioti (How I Met Your Mother) does an excellent job in her lead role, with a great supporting cast, to include J.K. Simmons (Cave Johnson) leading a wonderful supporting cast, except for Tyler Hoechlin (CW Superman: \"Supergirl\", \"Flash\", etc.), who I might just not like because he was Superman, but it's supposed to be an disliked character...so....good job?\r\n\r\nThe medium of the transfer being shown is an interesting option as we saw in the \"Happy Death Day\" movies, but it does allow for a reasoning of how it works, can it be broken / manipulated as opposed to divine will.  Most importantly, it allows for more than just one subject being affected, which is really where it gets set apart.\r\n\r\nThe trope bleeds a little when you have multiple people trapped in the loop: you have multiple people trapped in a thing: you have multiple people trapped in a prison.  When multiple people are trapped in a environment together, they tend to get a little strange, and we get that sort of thing a plenty.  Because we have multiple story threads to follow, we're almost seeing 3 stories all overlapping, and the movie does a great job of showing those, whether or not their in chronological order, or happening at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhether you see it as a prison break movie, or a time loop movie, this movie has a lot of fun in it, along with deep metaphysical philosophy, so there is something for everyone.", "created_at": "2020-07-22T12:16:33.276Z"}, {"movie_id": 587792, "review_id": "5f2b1ce6d8cc4a0038210f5e", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "This is a reimagining of Groundhog Day, but I think it stands pretty well on its own merits.

The film, written by Andy Siara and directed by Max Barbakow, is a weird hipster version of \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d with a story about two semi-dorks stuck in an infinite loop where they must relive the same sunrise to sunset over and over again.\r\n\r\nNovember 9th is the perfect date for a Palm Springs destination wedding, and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) is there for her younger sister\u2019s big day. The elder sibling has a real chip on her shoulder, reluctant to serve as the maid of honor and not a big fan of formal events.

It's not that I don't like the genre (I appreciate and enjoy every single one), but I find its movies tremendously difficult to *really* love. The massive majority follow the genre's formulas and cliches to such an extent that I rarely end up truly loving one of these films. Some are way too cheesy. Others are way too unrealistic and dream-like. But the aspect that throws me off the most is the lack of originality. I can't remember the last rom-com I watched that didn't borrow from countless other installments. I didn't know a thing about Palm Springs: no trailers, no knowledge of critics/audience's opinion, nothing... And I'm extremely happy about that!\r\n\r\nI usually watch the main trailer for every film I review *after* I've seen the actual movie. I ignore all other trailers, clips, images, and so on. I do this so I can have some sort of knowledge regarding how far I can take my spoiler-free reviews. This way, I'm sure that I don't write about something I shouldn't. The official trailer for this film doesn't ruin the experience in any way, but it does tell its viewers the most relevant aspect of its screenplay. So, I could address it in this review, but I won't... because I enjoyed this movie a lot more, not knowing a thing about it than if I knew how it developed its story.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I'll keep it really vague, and just write that Andy Siara's first feature-film screenplay can easily snatch a couple of nominations when the awards season comes around. This is a rom-com like no other due to its refreshingly unique concept. It's true that it's not an entirely new method of storytelling. Many other movies also employ this idea, but Siara holds so many surprises within his narrative and so few of the genre's common traits that the whole film is elevated by his outstanding writing.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the most entertaining movies of the year. With a short runtime and a fast pace, Palm Springs is constantly being genuinely fun, engaging, and even mysteriously intriguing. Its original plot makes the viewer think and remember previous lines that take a whole different meaning a few minutes later. There are no predictably dumb narrative decisions, and its characters escape the cheesy and forced relationships that these films usually insert them in. The dialogues are hilariously captivating. Almost every single plot point packs an emotional punch, a jaw-dropping revelation that never crossed the viewer's mind.\r\n\r\nAndy Samberg and Cristin Milioti share such great chemistry. Their characters are exceptionally developed, and their relationship feels incredibly real. I'm rarely that viewer who requires the main characters to be together, kiss, fall in love, and all that, but Nyles and Sarah are two wonderful protagonists I can definitely root for. Both carry an interesting \"baggage\", which is also explored at a deep level. They deal very differently with the \"situation\" that the story puts them in, and it's so much fun to watch them go through it and evolve as characters. Oh, and J.K. Simmons (Roy)... this man doesn't know how not to be utterly remarkable!\r\n\r\nMax Barbakow (directorial debut) demonstrates his talents as well, by allowing Siara's screenplay to shine under impeccable direction. Tonally, it never loses its balance. It keeps its comedy pretty grounded, considering the craziness of its premise. It never relies on the genre's formulas, cliches, and cheesy outcomes. It really separates itself from the majority of modern rom-coms. I don't really have any flaws to point out... The ending does have a \"just accept it\" narrative component, and there are a couple of unnecessary scenes, but I'm nitpicking here.\r\n\r\nI can't believe I'm going to write this, but Palm Springs is not only one of the best rom-coms I've ever seen, but it's also one of the best (if not *the* best) movies of 2020, so far. With the help of their first-time director (Max Barbakow), Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti spread their extraordinary chemistry all over the innovative, original narrative, written by the also debutant, Andy Siara. The latter is undoubtedly the main responsible for such an entertaining film. Siara takes an imaginative concept and develops it in the most captivating, fun, hilarious, and even intriguing way possible. A surprising screenplay packed with emotionally impactful plot points, revelations, and twists that keep the enjoyment levels extremely high. The two protagonists are exceptionally developed, as well as their compelling relationship. With a fast pace and a perfect balance of its tone, Palm Springs sets itself apart from the other movies of the genre, staying away from all of the cliches, formulas, and stereotypes associated with it. J.K. Simmons also lends his awesomeness because why not? Whether you're a fan of rom-coms or not, I definitely suggest giving this one a look.
