(Although it's much more focused on the laughs than the cheerleading)**\r\n\r\nFired Up is the cheerleading version of Pitch Perfect. It overflows with dorky characters, hilariously strange situations, and gut-busting quotes that will stick with you. Fired Up knows it's completely and outlandishly ridiculous and enjoys every goofy second of its insane existence. The premise of 2 guys skipping football camp to chase girls at cheerleading camp sounds like every other teen film but Fired Up is surprisingly fun, witty, and at moments even endearing. Eric Christian Olsen and Nicholas D'Agosto make a fantastic comedy duo, building one-liners on top of each other with excellent chemistry and hilarity. And John Michael Higgins is just as crazed and entertaining as ever. Overall, Fired Up is a much better-than-average stupid humor movie with a cast and director that know how to do comedy.", "created_at": "2022-12-09T23:48:56.575Z"}]
