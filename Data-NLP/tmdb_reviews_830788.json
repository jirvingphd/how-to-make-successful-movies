It's a short and sweet tale of the young \"Evie\" (Nathalie Emmanuel).

After about thirty seconds, she is invited to come to Yorkshire for a wedding and, as you would - readily accepts. Upon arrival, she encounters their irascible butler \"Fields\" (Sean Pertwee) and then the hunky lord of the manor \"Walt\" (Thomas Doherty). She is smitten, indeed they are at it within twenty four hours - but soon she starts to sense that things at the new \"Carfax Manor\" are not quite what they may seem - not least because there is a distinct lack of bride and groom; and the waitresses employed to cater for the occasion have a habit of disappearing. What could be going on...? Well, it's fairly clear to us from the start who the baddie is, and that \"Viktoria\" (a sort of Angelina Jolie-esque Stephanie Corneliussen) and her pal \"Lucy\" (Alana Boden) are in on the cunning scheme too. It has clearly been done on a limited budget, but the direction is still just about adequate. The story, though, is pretty thin and the acting is drama school stuff for the most part before an ending that really does let the whole thing down rather badly.
