Great cast, fast paced plot and entertaining action. The ending slightly underwhelms, but I still found myself satisfied with it. The special effects are good, it's only \"The Nautilus\" that looks less than so.\r\n\r\nSean Connery does carry the film as Quatermain, he's terrific throughout - really enjoyed the way his character carries himself. I liked Tony Curran's Skinner too. I actually rate all the characters to be honest, with Jason Flemyng (Jekyll/Hyde) and Stuart Townsend (Gray) being my picks of the rest.\r\n\r\nMerits a watch, even if Connery didn't remember it all that fondly.", "created_at": "2020-11-22T01:31:36.022Z"}, {"movie_id": 8698, "review_id": "629ef5eec8a2d40050478bb1", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": ".", "created_at": "2022-06-07T06:53:34.746Z"}]
