One of the reasons I liked the first movie is that they got back to the spirit of the original \"Scary Movie\" franchise before they took it from the Wayans.\r\n\r\nThere are a few jokes that just run too long, but over all the jokes are pretty funny and consistent, even doing call backs.\r\n\r\nThe movie rolls together several different paranormal tropes very well, and given some very short re-writes could have been a rather complex legitimate horror movie.", "created_at": "2021-06-19T19:18:54.033Z"}]
