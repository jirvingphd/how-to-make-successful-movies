While 21 is not groundbreaking in its storytelling or execution, it's a fun and enjoyable film with a good twist and likable characters. This film sets itself apart from a typical heist movie in that card counting is not technically illegal. The characters weren't trying to escape police but casino enforcers with brass knuckles and examples to make. This relatively unknown cast surprised with its solid performances boosted by the film's great pacing and exciting story.", "created_at": "2022-09-10T14:57:21.643Z"}]
