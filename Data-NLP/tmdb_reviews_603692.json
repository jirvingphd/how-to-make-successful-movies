This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful \"Marquis\" (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), who has managed to get those at the \"High Table\" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting \"Winston\" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the \"Marquis\" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for \"Wick\", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game.

Use your finely tailored Kevlar\u00ae\ufe0f suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2\u00bd hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsg\u00e5rd isn't remotely menacing - like a poor \"James Bond\" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting \"thwack\" and \"pow\" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored.

If you\u2019re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you\u2019re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren\u2019t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise\u2019s highest body count in its wake.\r\n\r\nAfter being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.\r\n\r\nThis is Reeves\u2019 movie through and through, and he\u2019s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It\u2019s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) breathes fresh life into the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you\u2019re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It\u2019s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.\r\n\r\nDirector Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn\u2019t a film with rapid cutting where you can\u2019t tell what is going on, and it\u2019s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski\u2019s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.\r\n\r\nDespite all of the things that are done right, the film\u2019s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It\u2019s one rousing, wild ride.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "created_at": "2023-04-23T06:01:43.342Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "6453c4fed48cee00e1339450", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "_John Wick: Chapter 4_ is explosive, nunchuck-bashing, bone-crunching cinematic ecstasy that allows action junkies to gorge on a buffet of bullet casings and broken necks.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/03/29/john-wick-chapter-4-review-a-buffet-of-bullet-casings-and-broken-necks/", "created_at": "2023-05-04T14:45:18.756Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "646233a5dbbb420119f5a44d", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\r\n\r\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\r\n\r\nScore: 93%\r\nVerdict: Excellent", "created_at": "2023-05-15T13:29:09.229Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "647028c89672ed01183cd93f", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "The John Wick franchise has now made it to its fourth and maybe final, film.

PEAK !!!!!!!! CINEMA !!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nIt's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. While the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre MCU got even worse with the release of **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being Kang, **Shazam: Fury of the Gods** being another one of DCEU projects which will soon cease to exist and **Scream VI** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. Therein comes along **John Wick: Chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone\u2019s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.\r\n\r\nI was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. Parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that John Wick: Chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. Let\u2019s just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain\u2019t just a chapter. It\u2019s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. I\u2019m just gonna come out and say it. This is the best cinematic experience I\u2019ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. This film absolutely floored me. Performances? **Peak**. Cinematography? **Double Peak**. Action Set Pieces? **Triple Peak**. Ending? **GOATED FR**.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, performances. If you told me 10 years ago that The Matrix films are going to remain as Keanu\u2019s most consistent and better performances, I would\u2019ve totally agreed with you. Cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. John Wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. Keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. He doesn\u2019t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that John Wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. Ian McShane also gives quite a performance here. Amplifying Winston\u2019s place as John\u2019s father figure, he is what I would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. Laurence Fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it\u2019s always nice to see Neo and Morpheus just strolling around and talking. And ofcourse, I\u2019m never going to get tired of seeing Hiroyuki Sanada in a film. He comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. The standouts to me though, are **Donnie Yen**, **Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd** and **Shamier Anderson**. All of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. Donnie Yen essentially plays the Chinese version of daredevil who isn\u2019t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn\u2019t think twice before a kill. Loved him in the film and the ways Chad Stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd rises up as this franchise\u2019s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. He plays a French billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. The pronunciation of certain words in the French accent and his control over the table\u2019s resources literally turned the City of Love into the City of Merciless Bloodshed. Shamier Anderson essentially plays what John Wick would\u2019ve been in the younger days. A hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.\r\n\r\nNow, the cinematography. This film was a visual spectacle. Everything, and I mean everything looks perfect. There isn\u2019t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. The work on display is truly fantastic here and I was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. This film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. Every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. I would be surprised if the academy doesn\u2019t nominate this film for Best Production Design or Best Cinematography because _**THIS IS ART MR. WHITE!**_ (who am I kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it\u2019s a huge summer blockbuster).\r\n\r\nWhere do I even begin with the action in this film. I was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after I\u2019ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. I was so wrong. There isn\u2019t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you\u2019ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. Make you completely get immersed in the action and John Wick Chapter 4 doesn\u2019t skip a beat.\r\n\r\nThe Ending. Ughhhhhhh. The Ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. I am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. It isn\u2019t a huge CGI bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar.

If you\u2019re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you\u2019re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren\u2019t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise\u2019s highest body count in its wake.\r\n\r\nAfter being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.\r\n\r\nThis is Reeves\u2019 movie through and through, and he\u2019s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It\u2019s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) breathes fresh life into the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you\u2019re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It\u2019s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.\r\n\r\nDirector Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn\u2019t a film with rapid cutting where you can\u2019t tell what is going on, and it\u2019s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski\u2019s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.\r\n\r\nDespite all of the things that are done right, the film\u2019s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It\u2019s one rousing, wild ride.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "created_at": "2023-04-23T06:01:43.342Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "6453c4fed48cee00e1339450", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "_John Wick: Chapter 4_ is explosive, nunchuck-bashing, bone-crunching cinematic ecstasy that allows action junkies to gorge on a buffet of bullet casings and broken necks.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/03/29/john-wick-chapter-4-review-a-buffet-of-bullet-casings-and-broken-necks/", "created_at": "2023-05-04T14:45:18.756Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "646233a5dbbb420119f5a44d", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\r\n\r\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see.

PEAK !!!!!!!! CINEMA !!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nIt's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. While the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre MCU got even worse with the release of **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being Kang, **Shazam: Fury of the Gods** being another one of DCEU projects which will soon cease to exist and **Scream VI** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. Therein comes along **John Wick: Chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone\u2019s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.\r\n\r\nI was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. Parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that John Wick: Chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. Let\u2019s just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain\u2019t just a chapter. It\u2019s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. I\u2019m just gonna come out and say it. This is the best cinematic experience I\u2019ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. This film absolutely floored me. Performances? **Peak**. Cinematography? **Double Peak**. Action Set Pieces? **Triple Peak**. Ending? **GOATED FR**.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, performances. If you told me 10 years ago that The Matrix films are going to remain as Keanu\u2019s most consistent and better performances, I would\u2019ve totally agreed with you. Cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. John Wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. Keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. He doesn\u2019t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that John Wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. Ian McShane also gives quite a performance here. Amplifying Winston\u2019s place as John\u2019s father figure, he is what I would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. Laurence Fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it\u2019s always nice to see Neo and Morpheus just strolling around and talking. And ofcourse, I\u2019m never going to get tired of seeing Hiroyuki Sanada in a film. He comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. The standouts to me though, are **Donnie Yen**, **Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd** and **Shamier Anderson**. All of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. Donnie Yen essentially plays the Chinese version of daredevil who isn\u2019t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn\u2019t think twice before a kill. Loved him in the film and the ways Chad Stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd rises up as this franchise\u2019s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. He plays a French billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. The pronunciation of certain words in the French accent and his control over the table\u2019s resources literally turned the City of Love into the City of Merciless Bloodshed. Shamier Anderson essentially plays what John Wick would\u2019ve been in the younger days. A hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.\r\n\r\nNow, the cinematography. This film was a visual spectacle. Everything, and I mean everything looks perfect. There isn\u2019t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. The work on display is truly fantastic here and I was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. This film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. Every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. I would be surprised if the academy doesn\u2019t nominate this film for Best Production Design or Best Cinematography because _**THIS IS ART MR. WHITE!**_ (who am I kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it\u2019s a huge summer blockbuster).\r\n\r\nWhere do I even begin with the action in this film. I was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after I\u2019ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. I was so wrong. There isn\u2019t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you\u2019ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. Make you completely get immersed in the action and John Wick Chapter 4 doesn\u2019t skip a beat.\r\n\r\nThe Ending. Ughhhhhhh. The Ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. I am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. It isn\u2019t a huge CGI bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar.

If you\u2019re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you\u2019re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren\u2019t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise\u2019s highest body count in its wake.\r\n\r\nAfter being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.\r\n\r\nThis is Reeves\u2019 movie through and through, and he\u2019s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It\u2019s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) breathes fresh life into the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you\u2019re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It\u2019s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.\r\n\r\nDirector Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn\u2019t a film with rapid cutting where you can\u2019t tell what is going on, and it\u2019s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski\u2019s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.\r\n\r\nDespite all of the things that are done right, the film\u2019s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It\u2019s one rousing, wild ride.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "created_at": "2023-04-23T06:01:43.342Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "6453c4fed48cee00e1339450", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "_John Wick: Chapter 4_ is explosive, nunchuck-bashing, bone-crunching cinematic ecstasy that allows action junkies to gorge on a buffet of bullet casings and broken necks.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/03/29/john-wick-chapter-4-review-a-buffet-of-bullet-casings-and-broken-necks/", "created_at": "2023-05-04T14:45:18.756Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "646233a5dbbb420119f5a44d", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\r\n\r\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\r\n\r\nScore: 93%\r\nVerdict: Excellent", "created_at": "2023-05-15T13:29:09.229Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "647028c89672ed01183cd93f", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "The John Wick franchise has now made it to its fourth and maybe final, film.

PEAK !!!!!!!! CINEMA !!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nIt's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. While the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre MCU got even worse with the release of **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being Kang, **Shazam: Fury of the Gods** being another one of DCEU projects which will soon cease to exist and **Scream VI** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. Therein comes along **John Wick: Chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone\u2019s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.\r\n\r\nI was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. Parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that John Wick: Chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. Let\u2019s just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain\u2019t just a chapter. It\u2019s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. I\u2019m just gonna come out and say it. This is the best cinematic experience I\u2019ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. This film absolutely floored me. Performances? **Peak**. Cinematography? **Double Peak**. Action Set Pieces? **Triple Peak**. Ending? **GOATED FR**.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, performances. If you told me 10 years ago that The Matrix films are going to remain as Keanu\u2019s most consistent and better performances, I would\u2019ve totally agreed with you. Cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. John Wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. Keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. He doesn\u2019t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that John Wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. Ian McShane also gives quite a performance here. Amplifying Winston\u2019s place as John\u2019s father figure, he is what I would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. Laurence Fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it\u2019s always nice to see Neo and Morpheus just strolling around and talking. And ofcourse, I\u2019m never going to get tired of seeing Hiroyuki Sanada in a film. He comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. The standouts to me though, are **Donnie Yen**, **Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd** and **Shamier Anderson**. All of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. Donnie Yen essentially plays the Chinese version of daredevil who isn\u2019t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn\u2019t think twice before a kill. Loved him in the film and the ways Chad Stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd rises up as this franchise\u2019s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. He plays a French billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. The pronunciation of certain words in the French accent and his control over the table\u2019s resources literally turned the City of Love into the City of Merciless Bloodshed. Shamier Anderson essentially plays what John Wick would\u2019ve been in the younger days. A hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.\r\n\r\nNow, the cinematography. This film was a visual spectacle. Everything, and I mean everything looks perfect. There isn\u2019t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. The work on display is truly fantastic here and I was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. This film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. Every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. I would be surprised if the academy doesn\u2019t nominate this film for Best Production Design or Best Cinematography because _**THIS IS ART MR. WHITE!**_ (who am I kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it\u2019s a huge summer blockbuster).\r\n\r\nWhere do I even begin with the action in this film. I was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after I\u2019ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. I was so wrong. There isn\u2019t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you\u2019ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. Make you completely get immersed in the action and John Wick Chapter 4 doesn\u2019t skip a beat.\r\n\r\nThe Ending. Ughhhhhhh. The Ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. I am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. It isn\u2019t a huge CGI bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar.

It was all very good.\r\n\r\nMusic: It was nice to hear the music from the old movies too. However, there was also new music. Every music was suitable for the stage and very good.\r\n\r\nAction: Although there were exaggerated scenes about action, it was better than all the first 3 movies. In particular, there is an action scene shot from the top. That scene is one of the best I've ever seen in the cinema. You enjoy each scene of the action separately. You have trouble sitting in the chair.\r\n\r\nMovie Duration: Even though the movie is long, you never notice it. It was a very moving movie.\r\n\r\nOverall: This movie is definitely worth watching.

If you\u2019re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you\u2019re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren\u2019t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise\u2019s highest body count in its wake.\r\n\r\nAfter being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.\r\n\r\nThis is Reeves\u2019 movie through and through, and he\u2019s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It\u2019s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) breathes fresh life into the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you\u2019re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It\u2019s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.\r\n\r\nDirector Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn\u2019t a film with rapid cutting where you can\u2019t tell what is going on, and it\u2019s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski\u2019s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.\r\n\r\nDespite all of the things that are done right, the film\u2019s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It\u2019s one rousing, wild ride.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**", "created_at": "2023-04-23T06:01:43.342Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "6453c4fed48cee00e1339450", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "_John Wick: Chapter 4_ is explosive, nunchuck-bashing, bone-crunching cinematic ecstasy that allows action junkies to gorge on a buffet of bullet casings and broken necks.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/03/29/john-wick-chapter-4-review-a-buffet-of-bullet-casings-and-broken-necks/", "created_at": "2023-05-04T14:45:18.756Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "646233a5dbbb420119f5a44d", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\r\n\r\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\r\n\r\nScore: 93%\r\nVerdict: Excellent", "created_at": "2023-05-15T13:29:09.229Z"}, {"movie_id": 603692, "review_id": "647028c89672ed01183cd93f", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "The John Wick franchise has now made it to its fourth and maybe final, film. The question is, is it any good?\r\n\r\nSimply put, its \"alright\". In much the same way, as its 2019 predecessor, was alright.

A more evolved story would have helped but regrettably, that was not on offer.\r\n\r\nIn summary, by no means a poor film but not quite as remarkable, in my estimation, as some reviews would suggest.

PEAK !!!!!!!! CINEMA !!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nIt's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. While the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre MCU got even worse with the release of **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being Kang, **Shazam: Fury of the Gods** being another one of DCEU projects which will soon cease to exist and **Scream VI** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. Therein comes along **John Wick: Chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone\u2019s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.\r\n\r\nI was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. Parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that John Wick: Chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. Let\u2019s just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain\u2019t just a chapter. It\u2019s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. I\u2019m just gonna come out and say it. This is the best cinematic experience I\u2019ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. This film absolutely floored me. Performances? **Peak**. Cinematography? **Double Peak**. Action Set Pieces? **Triple Peak**. Ending? **GOATED FR**.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, performances. If you told me 10 years ago that The Matrix films are going to remain as Keanu\u2019s most consistent and better performances, I would\u2019ve totally agreed with you. Cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. John Wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. Keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. He doesn\u2019t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that John Wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. Ian McShane also gives quite a performance here. Amplifying Winston\u2019s place as John\u2019s father figure, he is what I would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. Laurence Fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it\u2019s always nice to see Neo and Morpheus just strolling around and talking. And ofcourse, I\u2019m never going to get tired of seeing Hiroyuki Sanada in a film. He comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. The standouts to me though, are **Donnie Yen**, **Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd** and **Shamier Anderson**. All of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. Donnie Yen essentially plays the Chinese version of daredevil who isn\u2019t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn\u2019t think twice before a kill. Loved him in the film and the ways Chad Stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd rises up as this franchise\u2019s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. He plays a French billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. The pronunciation of certain words in the French accent and his control over the table\u2019s resources literally turned the City of Love into the City of Merciless Bloodshed. Shamier Anderson essentially plays what John Wick would\u2019ve been in the younger days. A hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.\r\n\r\nNow, the cinematography. This film was a visual spectacle. Everything, and I mean everything looks perfect. There isn\u2019t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. The work on display is truly fantastic here and I was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. This film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. Every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. I would be surprised if the academy doesn\u2019t nominate this film for Best Production Design or Best Cinematography because _**THIS IS ART MR. WHITE!**_ (who am I kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it\u2019s a huge summer blockbuster).\r\n\r\nWhere do I even begin with the action in this film. I was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after I\u2019ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. I was so wrong. There isn\u2019t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you\u2019ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. Make you completely get immersed in the action and John Wick Chapter 4 doesn\u2019t skip a beat.\r\n\r\nThe Ending. Ughhhhhhh. The Ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. I am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. It isn\u2019t a huge CGI bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar.
