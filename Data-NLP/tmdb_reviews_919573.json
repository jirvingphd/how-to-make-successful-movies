Here, though, the story is all just a little too far-fetched! He (\"Abel\") takes his mother \"Sylvie\" (Anouk Grinberg) to prison where she runs an acting class and where she has hooked up with \"Michel\" (Roschdy Zem). Now \"Abel\" is a bit sceptical about his mother marrying an ex-con and soon he and his best mate \"Cl\u00e9mence\" (No\u00e9mie Merlant) and carrying out some fairly clumsy surveillance on the man. \"Michel\" is no fool though and before we know it, the spying pair are mixed up a plan to pinch a great supply of caviar from a van in a petrol station car park! What ensues here does raise the odd smile and is generally an adequate little drama - but it still tends a little too much to weak slapstick inso far as it's a comedy. It's also a love story and a family drama that is better than soap, but only just - it's like we are watching an incomplete episode in the lives of people that we don't really know - nor get to know, either. Merlant is a breath of fresh air and she gels well with her increasingly hapless pal \"Abel\" as we head to a denouement with a few twists to keep us guessing. I did quite enjoy it, but it's totally forgettable fayre, sorry.", "created_at": "2023-10-20T07:08:02.899Z"}]
