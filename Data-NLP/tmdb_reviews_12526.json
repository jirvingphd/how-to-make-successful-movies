He\u2019s addressed it head-on as both fiction and fact, but Bug sees him take a more oblique route.

One demon leaves one body to enter another, but an obsession is Legion.\r\n\r\nEvery Michael Shannon performance is arguably his best, but this is a film tailor-made for his fascinating idiosyncrasies. Aphid and spastic, his body language stops short of actually turning into a freaking insect.\r\n\r\nAshley Judd, however, has a more challenging role, because not only does she have to sell the transition from sane to crazy, but then she has to catch up with Shannon, go toe-to-toe with him, match his manic intensity \u2014 and I\u2019ll be damned if she doesn\u2019t; Judd digs deep and reaches a place of utter darkness and desperation. She stares right into the abyss and doesn\u2019t flinch.\r\n\r\nEverybody is in point, though; Friedkin and screenwriter Tracy Letts, pull off the rare double-turn (to use wrestling terminology). Harry Connick Jr., who plays Judd\u2019s character\u2019s abusive ex, is all brawn and no brains, while Shannon starts out helpless and meek (his patented, infallible calm-before-the-storm routine); we begin to dread the seemingly inevitable moment when Connick beats Shannon within an inch of his life, only to end up wishing that the former would slap some sense into the latter.\r\n\r\nThe only problem with this film is that it builds so much momentum it just can\u2019t help crashing and burning. It\u2019s so climactic that it actually becomes anticlimactic. There\u2019s no resolution, no catharsis. For all its shock and awe, The Exorcist allows itself a hopeful, optimistic coda; Bug lacks such an escape valve.
