The original unexpectedly made all this money and so now we have this generic film. There are many, many worse films you could show you children if they like animals - it\u2019s a harmless 90 minutes and its not like their aren\u2019t laughs. I just wish the film was a whole lot more creative.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-secret-life-of-pets-2-crowd-pleasingly-generic-again\r\n\r\nHead to https://www.maketheswitch.com.au/sff for more Sydney Film Festival reviews.", "created_at": "2019-06-08T07:46:54.474Z"}, {"movie_id": 412117, "review_id": "63bf80b0a5743d00dd53fda0", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "I usually do the thing where I just give films 10 stars if they are fun and 1 star if they aren't...but Pets was just OK, so I'm taking the middle path.\r\n\r\nAnd really, it's getting 5 instead of one because of Rooster, who gets the only real laughs in what are scenes that are basically ripped straight out of City Slickers... only with dogs. He even has a few stories that will be infinitly quotable.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you have the laser gag and that's really it as far as laughs.\r\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and has a nice sort of Gershwin feel to it, but otherwise the Pets 2 is nothing to write home about. It doesn't really win with the comedy vibe or the adventure vibe, it all feels rehashed, like we've seen it all before when it was better.\r\n\r\nAnd honestly that's because we have.", "created_at": "2023-01-12T03:38:24.659Z"}]
