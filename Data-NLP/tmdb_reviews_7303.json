He was good, not phenomenal, but I miss Bob Hoskins.\r\n\r\nThe overall story is actually pretty well written, and most of the character dialogue / interaction is cute, but the working vs elite battle to bridge trope is a little heavy for a romantic comedy.  And then the resolution is that Jennifer Lopez is just that hot.  I hope that wasn't a spoiler for someone, because it's really not.\r\n\r\nI honestly wish we had gotten a little bit more out of the pursuit of a woman he didn't know and more action out of the bad guy, but for the stereotypical elite, \"I'm going to have you fired, do you know who I am?\" seems appropriate enough, right?\r\n\r\nWhile I do think it is worth a watch, there are a lot of other things out there to watch, just not \"Gigli\" or \"The Wedding Planner\".", "created_at": "2021-01-12T04:47:06.044Z"}, {"movie_id": 7303, "review_id": "64af5a116a3448014d34d4eb", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Ok movie, this is probably every maids dream.
