Other humans hide in the wilderness, living a primitive life. However, one \u201cman-animal\u201d (Barry Pepper) spurs a movement to free the planet. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker play chief-security Psychlos.\r\n\r\nBased on L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s book from 1982, \u201cBattlefield Earth\u201d (2000) is post-apocalyptic sci-fi that mixes \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d and \u201cLogan\u2019s Run\u201d with a little \u201cTerminator\u201d and some \u201cStar Wars\u201d dogfighting in the last act. It is notorious as one of the worst movies ever made, at least those with a healthy budget. The nitpicking has been so out of hand that Roger Ebert even criticized the font chosen for the opening titles (rolling my eyes).\r\n\r\nThe truth is, it\u2019s not close to being that bad. Unlike the similar \u201cThe Lost Future\u201d (a low-budget flick from 2010), the pace is a little too frenzied, no doubt because the script tried to cram the first half of a 1000-page novel into a 2-hour film. Despite this, it\u2019s not like the story\u2019s unintelligible, although it needed to flesh-out the heroes further in order to make it more compelling. Some complain about the use of Dutch angles, but this is barely perceptible and, besides, they give the movie a unique vibe. Then there\u2019s the cavil about the constant double wipes to change scenes. Seriously? Who cares? No one complains about the wipes in \u201cStar Wars.\u201d\r\n\r\nSure, Travolta takes a hammy approach to his Psychlo character, as do other Psychlo cast-members, but that\u2019s part of the fun. You\u2019re supposed to roll with it. There\u2019s a glaring wink of amusement to the proceedings. So anyone who says the movie\u2019s \u201cunintentionally\u201d funny is clueless.  \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest real problems is the absent of any significant female characters. There\u2019s Sabine Karsenti as Chrissy, but her role isn\u2019t that big and she\u2019s underused. Meanwhile Kelly Preston has a long-tongued cameo as Psychlo Chirk, but that\u2019s it (not counting peripherals). The remake of \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d came out the next year and had enough sense to include Estella Warren in a fairly prominent role; the same thing with \u201cThe Lost Future\u201d with Annabelle Wallis, not to mention Hannah Tointon and Eleanor Tomlinson.\r\n\r\nTo the film\u2019s credit, a certain scene in the last act prefigures a (more) memorable scene in Abrams\u2019 \u201cStar Trek\u201d nine years later. I\u2019m not saying this is a great movie, it has its issues, but the over-criticism is unjustified and reminiscent of the ridiculous response to the well-done \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate.\u201d Perhaps due to the links to Sciencefictionology, the knives hit the sharpening stones well before it was ever released and once the buzz got out that it was a bad film a feeding frenzy ensued.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in Montreal, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and several other Quebec locations.
