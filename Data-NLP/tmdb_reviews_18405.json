A remake of Craven\u2019s 1972 film of the same name (itself influenced by Ingmar Bergman\u2019s The Virgin Spring), it stars Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter, Garret Dillahunt, Sara Paxton, Spencer Treat Clark and Martha MacIsaac.

When bad weather forces Krug\u2019s car to career off the road, the gang, unbeknownst to them, seek refuge in the vacation home of Mari\u2019s parents.

With The Last House on the Left, remaking it, to me at least, is understandable given the 72 film is not exactly a great classic itself. True enough to say it has that grainy grunginess that was so befitting the decade\u2019s horror movies, marking it out as an unsettling experience without really living up to its \u201cterrifying\u201d reputation. In fact if you put both movies together they still wouldn\u2019t have enough class in them to give Bergman\u2019s movie a run for its money.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo the remake then, all glossy and big budgeted, with name actors in the principal roles, it is by definition routinely packaged for the modern day audience. However, that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that what unfolds on that screen is challenging us, it really does do its job.
