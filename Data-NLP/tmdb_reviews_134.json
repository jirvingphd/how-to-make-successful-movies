The cast is entertaining, which also includes the likes of Daniel von Bargen. It\u2019s quirky and amusing augmented by its setting and locations, not to mention one of my wife\u2019s favorite movies (possibly because Clooney was in his prime). In ways, it\u2019s like \u201cDeliverance\u201d (1972) if it were a comedy, just mixed with \u201cCool Hand Luke\u201d (1967) and a dash of Homer\u2019s Odyssey. \r\n\r\nI like it, but don\u2019t love it; it\u2019s fun, no doubt, but also kinda forgettable. Yet the song \u201cI Am a Man of Constant Sorrow\u201d is well done and catchy.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot mostly in Mississippi, plus some stuff done at Universal Studios.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "created_at": "2021-07-22T17:36:18.917Z"}, {"movie_id": 134, "review_id": "64ba7bf23009aa011c9a8d21", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "Weird convicts that escape.
