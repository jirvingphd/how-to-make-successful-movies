It features great locations shot with great cinematography, but that\u2019s about all director D.J. Caruso can do to entice us to keep watching. It\u2019s terrific to see a story unfolding in a non-CGI, true-to-life setting, even if it\u2019s Cape Town standing in for California (but then some of the greatest westerns were filmed in Europe, so there\u2019s that), but while this movie arguably achieves the western look, it fails to conjure up any sort of western feel.\r\n\r\nThe script concerns a Hooker with a Heart of Gold known as Angel, who is so sought after that the local Madame, who calls herself Duchess, holds a daily raffle to determine which lucky slack-jawed gold miners \u2013 there is more than one winner per day \u2013 get to hold sexual congress with her. This is such a cumbersome arrangement that it actually gets in the way of the plot, so that co-writers Francine Rivers and Caruso Hand Wave it not long after they have introduced it.\r\n\r\nSo-called \u201cdirt farmer\u201d Michael Hosea becomes smitten with Angel, so what does he do to get near her? Does he buy all the numbers in the raffle? Does he have the raffle rigged? No and no; he simply \u201cpays double\u201d. That\u2019s it. Why this hasn\u2019t occurred to at least some of the yokels who form a daily scrum outside the brothel is anybody\u2019s guess. Another good question is where Michael, who is not a miner, finds enough \u201cgold dust\u201d to gain access to Angel on three different occasions.\r\n\r\nAngel wants nothing to do with Michael owing to a deep-seated hatred and distrust of men, which is established in a series of flashbacks that are so many and so long they could make up an entire, separate movie all by themselves. They are also the reason that Redeeming Love unnecessarily breaks the 120-minute mark. But the oddest part about these flashbacks is that they show Angel escaping a life of compulsory whoredom only to enter a life of voluntary whoredom. Twice. Maybe even thrice, but that last time is once again against her will. In any case, it gets to be quite repetitive after a while.\r\n\r\nIt is only after Angel gets the tar beaten out of her by the Duchess\u2019s lackey Magowan that she relents and agrees to marry Michael \u2013 but first he has to pay off her \u201cdebt\u201d to the Duchess, and the irony that he literally buys Angel off in order to make an honest woman out of her is lost on Michael and Caruso alike.\r\n\r\nRedeeming Love\u2019s greatest achievement, other than its photography, is how well it masks its biblical pedigree. According to Wikipedia this is a \u201cChristian Western\u201d based on an homonymous novel by Rivers (unread by me, though it wouldn\u2019t surprise if she had first published it under the pseudonym F.R. Ancine), which in turn is inspired by an obscure Old Testament book \u2013 not that you would even guess at any of this by watching the movie, and that\u2019s actually a good thing. It may be long and boring, but at least it\u2019s not overtly preachy.", "created_at": "2022-08-28T06:17:59.796Z"}]
