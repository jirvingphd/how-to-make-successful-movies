When I saw the movie poster with that building the background, I thought the movie would be something like 'White House Down' which will be defended against the terrorist takeover/attack. Poster also misleads that the movie is a complete action pack, but it was not. It was a crime-thriller which was based on the real story.\r\n\r\nThe sudden variation in scenes and the character behaviors kind of  incompetence to keep balanced everything in the story progress. Inspired by a real event is what kept my interest all the way. Suppose it was fictional that was written for the movie I would have said the writer was confused between character to build and story development.\r\n\r\nOn the other side the performances promised to conclude the movie on a high note and it does. One of it was Dwayne Johnson, actually it was not his movie, but his part was a highlight alongside Liam Hemsworth and Michael Angarano. Could have done a little better in few parts for the best outcome. Anyway, it will entertain you, but cannot remain in your memory for so long.\r\n\r\n6/10", "created_at": "2014-09-11T16:20:57.434Z"}]
