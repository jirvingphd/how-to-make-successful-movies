There may very well be some comedy sketch writing here, but everything is strung together rather seamlessly that you don't really notice that aspect.\r\n\r\nWhile Tommy Lee Jones is a fantastic straight man, the girls play it up really well.  This is wonderfully casted, and they found ladies that can hold their own against such a veteran actor.\r\n\r\nOf course the plot is fueled by stupidity and ridiculous scenario so there is a lot to laugh about, but there is a heavy amount of dark tragedy creating the foundation of this story.  Weirdly they manage to leave out the \"lives in danger\" aspect of story for quite a while, but keep the silly through until the end of the movie.\r\n\r\nNot going to be the funniest movie ever, but it has held up surprisingly well over the years.", "created_at": "2020-10-23T20:43:18.056Z"}]
