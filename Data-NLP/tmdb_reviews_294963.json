Possible for a sequel, but I think that's not a good idea unless it retains the same crew. If you're okay with a slow narration, then you will enjoy it. Compared to the opening, when it ends, you will feel satisfied. It is not a greatest western of all time, but still worth a watch.\r\n\r\n7/10", "created_at": "2016-07-14T17:07:14.684Z"}, {"movie_id": 294963, "review_id": "5fbbeef675f1ad003d8e5175", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "_**Slow-burn Indie Western with a quality cast builds to a potent climax**_\r\n\r\nIn the 1890s, four men in the Southwest\u2014a sheriff (Kurt Russell), his aged deputy (Richard Jenkins), a gunslinger (Matthew Fox) and a wounded cowboy foreman (Patrick Wilson)\u2014set out to bring back captives kidnapped by a mysterious nameless tribe that lives several days ride away. Lili Simmons plays the cattleman\u2019s wife while David Arquette plays a trashy outlaw. Sid Haig has a small role in the opening.\r\n\r\n\u201cBone Tomahawk\u201d (2015) has a surprisingly good cast for an Indie Western that only cost $1.8 million and shot in 21 days. It was the first film written/directed by S. Craig Zahler and reveals a master filmmaker in that he was able to make a quality movie on such a low-budget. The film has the confidence to take its time with interesting characters and entertaining mundane dialogues, which is reminiscent of Tarantino. There are flashes of violence, but this is a slow-burn Western that builds to a rewarding climax.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a unique Western that meshes the Tarantino-style with realistically mundane Westerns like \u201cThe Homesman\u201d (2014) and horrific gritty Indies like \u201cCry Blood, Apache\u201d (1970). It\u2019s superior to the latter two, especially \u201cCry Blood,\u201d but it\u2019s not quite in the ballpark of Tarantino due to lack of funds. Yet it ain\u2019t far off either. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, and was shot at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-", "created_at": "2020-11-23T17:18:46.122Z"}, {"movie_id": 294963, "review_id": "63dc3ff3a9117f00d1d8877d", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "Fugly.  \r\n\r\nThere were so many things to dislike, hate, and/or projectile-vomit from this ghastly horror that I am a little embarrassed about how I couldn't wait to grab some alone time to watch Bone Tomahawk.  This is a gorge-suppressingly awful movie that is too long, more tedious than suspenseful, and features a man getting scalped, strangled, and split in two, crotch to chops.  I thought the water buffalo in Apocalypse Now had it easier.\r\n\r\nThe movie vaguely reminded me of John McTiernan's The Thirteenth Warrior (with a dash of Quest for Fire).  In TTW, an Arab diplomat hooks a ride with Beowulf and his posse.  The blood flows like spaghetti sauce as the \"Geats\" fight it out with a tribe of spider-worshipping Neandernasties. \r\n \r\nHere, a mini-posse of 1890s Southwesterners go on a rescue mission into desert badlands held by a pack of \"Trogladytes.\"  Where McTiernan drives the narrative at a bone-crushing pace, Bone Tomahawk crushes bones, slices scalps and genetalia, and makes the characters almost impossible to like.  Kurt Russell, a man who has a voice as gritty as his stare is cold, is so restrained that the fire he brought to Tombstone is almost snuffed out.  \r\n\r\nI suspect the movie tried to present the good guys as flawed and believable, but we get tired of endless trudging through the outback of the Southwest while the characters use arcane language.\r\n\r\nAs I'm writing this, I'm slowly changing my mind about the blandness of the characters.  Maybe they are, in their own way, working-class anti-heroes, but I just wanted a bit more savagery on the part of the \"good guys.\"\r\n\r\nI'm going to hit \"submit\" now and hope my wife has not prepared spaghetti for dinner.", "created_at": "2023-02-02T22:57:55.526Z"}]
