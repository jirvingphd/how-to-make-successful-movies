Can the relationship survive their pestering?\r\n\r\n\"She\u2019s Out of My League\" (2010) is a surprisingly well-written, well-casted romcom that\u2019s entertaining throughout, but it\u2019s ruined for me by a little too much gross or profane (non)humor and I can\u2019t in good conscience give it a higher grade. This is unfortunate because the flick didn\u2019t need to stoop to that low-level.\r\n\r\nBut if you can stomach the needlessly gross bodily fluid & raunchy \u2018humor\u2019 of \u201cThere\u2019s Something about Mary\u201d (1998), \u201cThe Girl Next Door\u201d (2004) and \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshal\u201d (2008) you might like it more than me.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in the Pittsburgh area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C", "created_at": "2019-12-09T19:33:08.076Z"}, {"movie_id": 34016, "review_id": "610c7bff68b1ea005f8080a1", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "I enjoyed She\u2019s Out of My League; let me get that out there at the outset. It is witty, mostly intelligent, and downright hilarious in places. Mind you, there were a few places that made me shake my head. There was some old fashioned gross-out humor, the sort I thought stopped being used in romantic comedies years ago. I particularly didn\u2019t like the semen stain interlude, though I admit that Kirk\u2019s friend\u2019s advice later on how to explain it to Molly nearly saved it completely for me. \r\n\r\nI also thought that having every male within twenty yards of Molly being paralyzed and struck dumb by her beauty was a bit overdone, but I am willing to overlook small issues if the movie is intelligent enough otherwise.\r\n\r\nI liked most of the characters, especially Marnie, who says the stuff everybody wants to say. Even Cam is made into a nice guy rather than a jerk, as most movies would make the handsome rival of the dweeb for the lady fair. All in all a fair entry into the crowded romantic comedy genre.", "created_at": "2021-08-06T00:02:07.500Z"}, {"movie_id": 34016, "review_id": "6379b9e6c2f44b00dcd87ce8", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "**She\u2019s Out of My League is edgier than need be with language and some of the humor, but in the end, it\u2019s a solid rom-com that isn\u2019t fun for the whole family but definitely fun for some.**\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not typically a fan of rated-R comedies because of the over-the-top sensuality, inappropriateness, and frequent nudity. While She\u2019s Out of My League definitely has inappropriate jokes and suggestive moments, the movie plays more towards the awkwardness of dating rather than the sexuality of the movie\u2019s stars and avoids nudity altogether. The focus on the embarrassing, awkward normalness of the main character leads to hilarious situations and laugh-out-loud moments. She\u2019s Out of My League could have been one of my all-time favorites if it had toned down the raunchiness a little further, but the spotlight on goofiness and an ending with some heart and sincerity make it my favorite R-rated rom-com.", "created_at": "2022-11-20T05:23:50.105Z"}]
