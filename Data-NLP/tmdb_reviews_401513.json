The daughter of the military commander, her boyfriend and their geeky friend make contact with him and he takes a bit of a shine to her. Now we embark on a rather silly adventure story with some really disappointing acting; a seriously stilted comedy script and even an inter-special blood transfusion! This story itself is more of a romance than anything else and reminded me a little of Noah Wyle's \"Falling Skies\" - mostly CGI, and not great CGI at that - but it is not, however, any worse than many big budget Hollywood sci-fi productions (i.e. \"Independence Day: Resurgence\") The almost Disney-esque dubbing really doesn't help either; I would far rather have seen it with subtitles... oh, and it's far too long!", "created_at": "2022-03-27T11:36:39.818Z"}]
