The story centres around aspiring actor \"Angel\" (Gael Garci\u00e1 Bernal) who turns up, unannounced, at the door of his former schoolfriend. This man \"Enrique\" (Fele Martinez) has gone on to become a successful film director and, perhaps optimistically, \"Angel\" hopes that the unfinished manuscript he has brought might turn out to be his ticket to success. It transpires that these men have not seen each other since school (some 16 years earlier) and that this document is semi-autobiographical - it takes both back to their childhood where, under the supervision of \"Fr. Manolo\" (Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho) they attended a catholic school where they had sexual encounters with each other and with others with varying degrees willingness. The story is dark, certainly, but here is plenty of humour and shagging as the story unfolds. We are deliberately left to judge the extent to which \"Angel\" is being truthful, fanciful or just plain enthusiastic, and we are also offered a fairly unique take on how vengeance might be applied. The narrative is complex, the timelines and characters shift making it quite a thought provoking film to both watch and begin to understand. Well worth it, though!", "created_at": "2023-09-04T04:49:06.957Z"}]
