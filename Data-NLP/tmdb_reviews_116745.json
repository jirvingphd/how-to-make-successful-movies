Excellent story, beautiful cinematography, and an inspirational message that somehow got overlooked. Life is meant to be lived, to be experienced... not day dreamed about, or fantasized in our heads! Get up, get out there, and get living!! I enjoyed this movie, as well as Ben Stiller's performance.", "created_at": "2015-06-04T10:44:11.757Z"}, {"movie_id": 116745, "review_id": "63b9f35a8c0a48008537f075", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "This surprised me in that I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Of course it was foolish of me to doubt Ben Stiller\u2019s magic both as actor and director. Given the imagination of Mitty\u2019s mundane character, some sequences in the film are surprisingly high octane action movie.  I had expected Mitty to be less likeable and more mundane than he actually was but given the action that he eventually realises, perhaps a hidden dynamism needs to be hinted at earlier.  Overall, a very enjoyable film for all ages. Great Performances and some amazingly photogenic scenery.   7/10", "created_at": "2023-01-07T22:34:02.936Z"}]
