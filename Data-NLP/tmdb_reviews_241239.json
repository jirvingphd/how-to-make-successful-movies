Oscar Isaac is fantastic in this movie. He was able to balance the intimidating front of a mobster while being able to present a sense of honesty as he was trying to avoid the more barbaric business practice of his contemporaries. It was a fine line, but it was a joy to see the mobster slowly start to take over as his desperation increased. Jessica Chastain was really good as well. She was a balancing force for Isaac's character and was just as badass in my opinion. They had amazing chemistry and formed a dynamic duo that was a force to be reckoned with. There is not a lot of action in this film, but the tension was thick and when there were more chaotic sequences they felt organic and real. The cinematography was top notch, I love the haze that was in this movie. It was nice touch and made the movie feel right at home in the 80's. This movie is not going to be for everyone, but I really dug it and recommend anyone to check it out.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _83%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Great_", "created_at": "2022-11-25T21:23:54.977Z"}, {"movie_id": 241239, "review_id": "6381326a2e0697026e9f4565", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "_A Most Violent Year_ took a long time to get me hooked, but once I was able to come around to it I was fully invested.
