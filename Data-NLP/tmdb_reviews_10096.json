The movie tells the story of Jenna Rink, a 13-year-old girl who wishes to become 30 years old overnight and wakes up the next day in her 30-year-old body, played by Jennifer Garner.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a classic example of a coming-of-age story, where Jenna, who was an awkward teenager, discovers the importance of friendship, love, and self-discovery. The film is set in the 1980s and has an upbeat and nostalgic tone that captures the spirit of the era. The movie features a stellar cast that includes Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo, and Judy Greer.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant strengths of the movie is the performance of Jennifer Garner. She captures the essence of a 13-year-old girl trapped in a 30-year-old body, and her portrayal of the character is genuine and heartfelt. Her transformation from a bratty teenager to a mature woman is well portrayed, and she delivers an excellent performance.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry between Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo, who plays her childhood friend, is another highlight of the movie. Their friendship and love story are charming and heartwarming, and their performances complement each other well.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast, including Judy Greer, who plays Jenna's frenemy, and Andy Serkis, who plays her boss, also deliver solid performances and add depth to the movie's narrative.\r\n\r\nThe movie's soundtrack is another strong point, featuring popular hits from the 80s that add to the film's nostalgic feel. The costumes and production design are also impressive, transporting the audience back in time.\r\n\r\nOne of the drawbacks of the movie is its predictability. The plot is formulaic, and the audience can see the ending coming from a mile away. However, this is a common issue in romantic comedies, and the strong performances and charming characters make up for this flaw.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"13 Going on 30\" is an enjoyable and heartwarming romantic comedy that captures the essence of the 80s and delivers a great performance by Jennifer Garner. Despite its predictable plot, the movie's strengths in acting, music, and production design make it a must-watch for fans of the genre. I rate it 6 out of 10.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWritten and Reviewed by RSOliveira", "created_at": "2023-03-10T13:15:32.154Z"}, {"movie_id": 10096, "review_id": "6413d841a6c1040079073dfc", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "I just like the concept of the movie.
