[{"movie_id": 308453, "review_id": "57a374429251410a5f002f0b", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "> The life of an arrogant and mean farmer Olympic medal winner.\r\n\r\nSurprised to see how the film was received. I mean it was not based on the real or something, the film was not bad either. A decent story and performances, but partially an inspiring theme. You know, of course, in the sports its about winning the medals, only till certain stage, then the time comes to end our journey for various reasons. But still there are other ways to use our gifts like on coaching and encouraging the young talents. That's what this film is about, and I enjoyed watching it.\r\n\r\nThe highlight was it looks some kind of a biographical film, but as I said it's not. I think the screenplay was well written, but pretty predictable story, especially the romance parts were outdated. The sport section was quite refreshing. The jokes were the okay type. The sex scene was awesome. It might be a little overdone, but well composed gymnastic poses. I liked the father-daughter sentiment. It was not emotional with great dialogues, but still a father fighting for his daughter to stand on her own feet was really good to see.\r\n\r\nIt is a chick flick, so both the lead girls were excellent. Pretty much impressive gymnastic stunts. Obviously the stunt double used for some of those parts. Had a good runtime and shot in wonderful places. A small budget film that shot within a month of time, but a great production quality. Entertaining film, but disappointment is it did not do well as expected at the box office. It is not a greatest sports film of all time, but I think there's no harm watching it once, you will realise that after giving it a try.\r\n\r\n7/10", "created_at": "2016-08-04T16:58:42.864Z"}, {"movie_id": 308453, "review_id": "6009e316e04d8a003fc36640", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nFinally a movie that proves that Melissa Rauch was the hot one on \"Big Bang Theory\".\r\n\r\nMelissa Rauch carries this one, above and beyond, and she shows her range into dirt comedy and psychological drama without batting an eye, like a champ.\r\n\r\nThe \"angry jerk\" routine gets old pretty fast, but it shifts throughout the movie so it's not unbearable, and for every ounce Raunch gives, Haley Lu Richardson comes back with \"happy idiot\" and it's a wonderful juxtaposition.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention to Sebastian Stan for helping Melissa Rauch with one of the most amazing sex scenes I've ever seen, and it's not even about it being dirty.
