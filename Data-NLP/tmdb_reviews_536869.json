I didn't see how, especially considering the costumes but it was being made so the question now was how it was going to look.\r\n\r\nI know there's already a ''movie'' but that's basically a recording of the play.\r\n\r\nThen the trailers appeared and what they showed looked weird, off putting and scary, but the visual work is not always everything in a movie, yet something decisive was being played here.\r\nEventually the defeat was inevitable.\r\n\r\nCats is full of good intentions but it's a failure, not only because of terrible work in CGI and how it makes you feel but because it never manages to immerse you in the world of the story and is a bizarre world and I can have fun in bizarre worlds, it's only that this one is pretty misguided.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's that huge fiasco that a lot of film critics are saying it is and maybe eventually will find its niche and audience, after all worse films have become cults films, so that can surely happen but right now Cats is simply an idea that didn't work, that it wasn't well executed or directed and that although it's not a monumental catastrophe, it's indeed a gigantic disappointment.", "created_at": "2019-12-23T23:44:11.605Z"}, {"movie_id": 536869, "review_id": "5e7d565cf794ad0013ef7ac6", "author_rating": null, "review_text": "Sometimes a movie struts its awfulness with such glee that it becomes an enjoyably sadistic pleasure rather than a chore to watch.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case with \u201cCats,\u201d the big screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s 1982 musical that became one of Broadway\u2019s longest-running shows.
