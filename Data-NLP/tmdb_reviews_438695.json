The new film finds Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) and his performers enjoying a run of sod-out shows in his theater.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to settle for success in a regional locale; Buster and crew set off for the big city to produce and perform a show for Bigshot Jimmy Crystal (Bobby Cannavale); who is as ruthless as they come. After conning his way into an audition; Buster claims their new show will feature the return of reclusive Rock Icon Clay Calloway (Bono); who has been a recluse for the past fifteen years.\r\n\r\nJimmy is intrigued and gives Buster a chance and inserts his daughter Porsha (Halsey) into the show despite the fact that while she is a gifted singer; her acting is cringe-worthy.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a madcap tale filled with music and humor as the crew desperately tries to get the show ready and stay away from the very dangerous Jimmy Crystal.\r\n\r\nThe music is very good and the cast is as enjoyable as ever. I would have liked to have seen Seth Mac Farlane return but the performances from Taron Egerton, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, and the ensemble more than deliver.\r\n\r\nFor those who enjoyed the first film and are looking for some fun entertainment for the family; \u201cSing 2\u201d is a winning performance.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5", "created_at": "2021-12-02T16:01:35.405Z"}]
