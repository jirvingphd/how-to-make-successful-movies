It\u2019s epic, ambitious, crazy, witty and unafraid to go for the heart as well as the throat. As a whole, this adaptation of maybe Stephen King\u2019s greatest work feels singular in the landscape of modern horror cinema: two films built on strong interconnected relationships spread over decades, as sentimental as they are vicious, and executed on the scale of a fantasy epic. They also may be amongst the best adaptations of King\u2019s work, understanding what makes his writing (and this novel in particular) so horrifying and so arresting, the human horror amongst the fantastical. Andy Muschietti aimed big with \u2018It\u2019, and even in the moments its reach exceeds its grasp, you\u2019re still so glad it reached so high in the first place.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-it-chapter-2-the-ambitious-conclusion-to-the-beloved-horror-epic", "created_at": "2019-09-04T14:05:06.156Z"}, {"movie_id": 474350, "review_id": "5d7a7a93069f0e10db322bcc", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSo, Chapter Two is a sequel to It (2017), and my expectations were a bit high. I really enjoyed the latter to the point of considering it one of the year\u2019s best, as well as one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations. Andy Muschietti returning to the director\u2019s chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the Losers (not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors) are two of the main reasons why I was genuinely excited. Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema\u2026\r\n\r\nWell, I got to be honest: I\u2019m disappointed. It\u2019s not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn\u2019t even come close to its predecessor\u2019s heels. I disagree with some headlines I\u2019ve read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There\u2019s barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn\u2019t as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.\r\n\r\nSome say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film\u2019s runtime, especially if it\u2019s over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long. There\u2019s more than enough story to explore, and literally, every single character from the Losers Club has an interesting arc. The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that\u2019s funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain\u2019s (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn\u2019t help the pacing.\r\n\r\nThe first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they\u2019re doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it\u2019s pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy / Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie\u2019s subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn\u2019t have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBeverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan / Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little \u201ckid\u201d who\u2019s scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean / Wyatt Oleff) doesn\u2019t do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017\u2019s movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but it\u2019s incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it\u2019s a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn\u2019t have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it\u2019s pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great\u2026 \r\n\r\nJames McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsg\u00e5rd had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn\u2019t have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd since there\u2019s so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.\r\n\r\nAndy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman\u2019s screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions. \r\n\r\nIn the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn\u2019t as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there\u2019s excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it\u2019s \u2026 okay.\r\n\r\nRating: C", "created_at": "2019-09-12T17:04:19.099Z"}, {"movie_id": 474350, "review_id": "5d8e4a85221ba60029b5a0fe", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "It's the love story between Richie and Eddie that makes this movie worth viewing twice.

The 90's version had it moments, but I find some scenes unintentionally funny where it reeked of early Stephen King adaptations. 2017 was surprisingly good and a massive improvement, but laid back on cheap thrills.\r\n\r\n\u2018IT: Chapter Two\u2019 was a tough act to follow up on after the monster success of the first and with the second chapter being the hardest to adapt. I thought the movie both succeeds and stumbles in parts. Although reflecting back makes it feel more like a parody than a serious horror movie. An epic finale that ended in a over the top fashion - with themes of childhood trauma and the idea of holding on to the past despite growing up with age are sprinkled through out. The loser club are all grown up now and returning home to kill IT.\r\n\r\nWhoever cast the grow up version of the loser club deserves massive praise here, because it\u2019s pitch perfect casting and I could definitely see the child stars growing up to be the adult stars. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, and Isaiah Mustafa were all great in bringing the more dramatic aspects to the film. While Bill Hader and James Ranson bring the comedic aspects, but not to say they weren't dramatic as well, even making me tear up at one point.\r\n\r\nBill Skarsgard was truly amazing as Pennywise. The physicality in his movement has a certain silliness that you would expect to see from a clown, yet predatory with his animal-like attacks with drool running down his mouth and eyes staring in opposite directions despite looking straight at you. I find the dancing clown incredibly terrifying whenever he becomes playful and kind to deceive children.\r\n\r\nAndy Muschietti truly shines as a director when it comes to bizarre imagery and unsettling camera angles, while also capturing some real emotions through the lens. The opening scene at the bridge where a homophobic attack takes place was really brutal and starts the movie off strong - on par with the Georgie meets Pennywise scene in the first movie.\r\n\r\nDespite the run time being nearly three hours long, but I can\u2019t recall ever being bored. It moved at a even pace in my opinion. I guess a few scenes could\u2019ve been cut as most of it is unused footage from the first movie. Although it would be difficult to cut scenes as everything follows up to the next scene and that emotional punch towards the end wouldn\u2019t be earned.\r\n\r\nNow for the issues:\r\n\r\nHenry Bowers was completely pointless in this movie and was only used for jump scars. Same thing with Mike, who through out these movies has nothing to do and the important things he did in the book was given to different characters.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t like how Stan\u2019s suicide was handle, because you find out he actually \u201csacrificed\u201d himself to save the others.\r\n\r\nSome of the humor didn\u2019t always land, especially if it\u2019s right after a tense scene where it kinda deflates the horror. At times I struggled to gasp what the film marker was going for in certain scenes. Is this scene suppose to be scary or funny? Both maybe?\r\n\r\nI wish there was more practical work for the monster scenes instead of CGI, because at times it looked really terrible. The finale battle at the end could\u2019ve been in a video game boss fight.\r\n\r\n* Overall rating: Not as strong as the first, but still enjoyed it.
