Tony Leung reprises his role from \"In the Mood for Love\" (2000) as \"Chow mo-wan\" who has now returned to Hong Kong to write his book - about a land called \"2046\". As he writes, he forms relationships of varying degrees of importance with four women but the more he tries to forget his past, the harder it is for him to move on, to escape from the memories of his now late wife. Is that the goal of \"2046\" - memories never die, never exist - time stands still? Leung handles this emotional tsunami of a film with aplomb, and as usual, there is a wonderfully eclectic soundtrack to keep the sense of confusion working nicely, too. Maybe a touch too long - but still an absorbing piece of cinema from a man who can juggle concepts and characterisations with some considerable skill.", "created_at": "2023-09-04T05:19:26.222Z"}, {"movie_id": 844, "review_id": "64f568de3d43e000acfe334a", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Another classic effort from Wong Kar-wai, this time with a touch of sci-fi added to his usually potent mix of romance and strong characters.
