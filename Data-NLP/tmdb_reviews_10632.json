Really basic plot (barely one if I'm being honest) but still entertained, partially because it was filmed in my native state of Oregon.", "created_at": "2019-08-28T22:27:13.603Z"}, {"movie_id": 10632, "review_id": "64f4c68a9e4586010030d05b", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "This reminded me of \"The Fugitive\" but without any real sense of jeopardy. Tommy Lee Jones (\"L.T. Bonham) is a retired expert in tracking and survival who is drafted in to help the FBI (who never appear to have the internal resources to carry out any sort of meaningful investigation by themselves!) catch up with a serial killer - one of his former pupils, no less. It's all been seen many times before, though Benicia de Toro as his antagonist does inject something desperate and evil into his role as \"Aaron Hallam\". It has plenty of pace and there is certainly a tension between the two stars as it starts to get a bit fuzzy as to who is the hunter an who is the hunted! Enjoyable enough, with quite an action-packed, intense ending, but nothing too original here.", "created_at": "2023-09-03T17:46:50.368Z"}]
