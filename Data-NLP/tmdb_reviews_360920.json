Alas, even my kids aged 11 and 14 found it uninteresting. Grandma came along, she loves all animation films, but even this failed to capture her interest.

I am so glad I finally managed to see it.\r\n\r\nLIKED:\r\n- the animation is absolutely stunning! all of the colours and the contrast with the snow was amazing.\r\n\r\n- Max was the most adorable puppy ever! for some reason, it reminded me of Dobby a bit :D\r\n\r\n- a big part of the story was told in verse and there were many quotes taken directly from the book.\r\n\r\nDISLIKED:\r\n- I kind of wanted more songs\r\n\r\n- Grinch wasn't portrayed as mean as I expected\r\n\r\nOVERALL:\r\nIt was cute, adorable and very Christmasy! Yes, it was cheesy but it is supposed to be like that. I think I prefer it as an animation.", "created_at": "2019-01-03T12:17:01.744Z"}, {"movie_id": 360920, "review_id": "5fd61db4d48cee003b73faad", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "It was a little too eccentric. I would've thought they would make the storyline similar to the 2000 remake, this time with Jim Carrey voicing the bullying mayor!\r\n\r\nStill, this film had its laughs, along with a voice cameo from Made in Chelsea's Toff!", "created_at": "2020-12-13T13:57:08.799Z"}, {"movie_id": 360920, "review_id": "5fdfb286d70594003c2ce02d", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "A much more family friendly story about <em>'The Grinch'</em>.\r\n\r\nI like it. It has a few issues but still does most things right, it's definitely solely made for families but that's not a negative - it does make sense to make an animated version of this Dr. Seuss book.\r\n\r\nWith that noted, I don't rate Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role. I don't think his voice suits the role at all, it needed someone who sounds more menacing and treacherous. I never felt, away from his obvious acts, any horrid side to Grinch here - though perhaps that suits the aforementioned family vibe they were aiming for.\r\n\r\nAway from Cumberbatch, I thoroughly enjoyed Pharrell Williams' narration and it's cool to hear Angela Lansbury in a minor role. The plot to this 2018 film is solid, but the thing about it that stands out most to me is the humour - which I found consistently amusing, there are some funny gags in there.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a film I'll look back on as being good - even if it could've been greater, especially with a more suitable lead. If we're comparing this and the 2000 production, I think I prefer this one? It's close, Jim Carrey is great in that but this one's pacing is much better.", "created_at": "2020-12-20T20:22:30.276Z"}]
