While it\u2019s better than \u201cTaras Bulba,\u201d it\u2019s not as good as the others, although it comes close. The beginning and ending are quite good, but somewhere in the middle it loses its mojo a bit.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a part-Ukrainian production and was shot in the Carpathian Mountains, the key members of the cast are either American or from the British Isles. The exceptions are a couple second tier cast members, like the actors playing Petro, Rosana and Burunda, the latter being from Mongolia. No doubt the background characters are from Ukraine & nearby regions.\r\n\r\nOliver Trevena stands out in the cast as the animated Bohun. Meanwhile Poppy Drayton is lovely as Myroslava. The score is exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes, and was shot in Zakarpattia, Ukraine, which is in extreme western Ukraine, with studio stuff done in Kyiv.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "created_at": "2022-08-18T19:40:29.388Z"}]
