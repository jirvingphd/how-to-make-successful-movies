Despite being released over ten years ago, the film couldn't be more current today. Our young people and teenagers, who grew up with computers and technologies, face them in such a friendly way that they are often unable to see the dangers they hide. Parents have the thorny mission of imposing limits and rules on their use, of informing and advising... but let's be honest: which teenager is really willing to listen to parents and their rules?\r\n\r\nThe script begins by introducing us to an ordinary, upper-middle class family. While the parents work and the eldest son prepares to enter university, the youngest daughter is trying to integrate into the school's popular girls' circle after making the school volleyball team. She's an ordinary teenager with the insecurities of many other girls... until she starts chatting online with an unknown guy. She realizes he's older, but it's only when they meet in person that she realizes he's already in his thirties. Even so, she continues the relationship and the growing intimacies lead to a sexual involvement, and to a family crisis when the parents discover, and try to find the identity of the seducer, since sexual abuse of minors is, of course, a crime.\r\n\r\nWell, I think I have to start by saying that I've seen, in real life, several cases and situations similar to the one in this movie. It is increasingly common for teenagers to maintain online dating and relationships, often without meeting in person, having more or less spicy conversations through social networks. It's a new form of sexuality that has emerged from the Internet and that can really mess with the head of a more influential girl. And it is not so rare for them to find, by chance, an adult with whom they maintain this type of contact. He may, or may not, tell about the age difference, and they may, or may not, accept it, or even use the situation as a form of rebellion towards their parents. But the fact that it is increasingly common does not mean that it is acceptable. It is a dangerous situation, where young people can get excited and reveal too much of themselves (habits, customs, erotic photos or videos, etc.) to potential sexual predators. These are dangers that can really worry a parent. And a stroll through social networks, such as Instagram or TikTok, is enough to see how teens are exposing themselves. In addition to making a very believable portrayal of a situation that could be real, the film explores well the relational conflicts between teenagers and her parents, and the consequences of what happened in her school, in their friendships, and with herself.\r\n\r\nThe cast is generally good and does a positive job. The director is effective, but not brilliant. The best performances come from the young Liana Liberato, who managed to be convincing in the role and give us a good interpretation, and also from Catherine Keener, very good in the role of a perfectly distressed mother.
