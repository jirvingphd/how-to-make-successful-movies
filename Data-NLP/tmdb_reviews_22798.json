While the roller derby aspect is great, and the romantic plot lines are good, and the best friend angle is really good (just realizing how multi-threaded this movie actually is), it is the self discovery, the character growth of Bliss (thanks to Ellen Page's powerful delivery) of being a person that we can barely hear, to being someone how is able to yell for what she wants, delivery a hit, and be a literal poster child.\r\n\r\nThe movie honestly makes me envious: while I'd like to be an attractive tough girl, sure, to find a passion while you still have time to enough to enjoy it, to find people to guide and support that passion, and then compete and find adversity from people twice your age is an amazing thing all to itself.\r\n\r\nI'll never be a \"roller derby girl\", but I know I can always come live vicariously through this movie.", "created_at": "2020-08-07T16:42:44.462Z"}, {"movie_id": 22798, "review_id": "5fa05d1b7e34830038a529ae", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "_**Coming of age with the roller derby girls**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 2009, \"Whip It\" was Drew Barrymore's first and (so far) only full-length film in the director's chair. Drew also co-stars, but her character is decidedly peripheral.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around 17 year-old Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page), her parents (Daniel Stern & Marcia Gay Harden) and her best friend, Pash (Alia Shawkat). Bliss is involved in the world of beauty pageants due to her mother's obsession, but becomes fascinated by a group of roller derby girls while visiting nearby Austin, TX. She decides to try-out for the the Hurl Scouts.\r\n\r\n\"Whip It\" starts out slow and only mildly interesting but it ultimately won me over. This is basically a coming-of-age drama using the roller derby as a backdrop and stage. Since Ellen Page takes center focus \"Whip It\" should appeal to fans of Page. I'm not a fan; I can take her or leave her. Thankfully, there's enough good here to draw in other folks.\r\n\r\nI especially like the roller derby girls and their camaraderie & competition. The girls include Juliette Lewis, Kristen Wiig, Eve, Zoe Bell, Ari Graynor, Eli Bleiler and Sydney Bennett. What I love about these women is that they have womanly curves and aren't walking sticks with big breasts. Take, for instance, the so-called Manson Sisters, played by Kristen Adolfi & Rachel Piplica; both are just gorgeous throughout the film and worth the price of admission -- stunning examples of womanhood.\r\n\r\nThere's a subplot about Bliss falling for a guy in a rock band (Landon Pigg) and there are other characters, like the coach, the derby announcer and the Hispanic manager of the restaurant Bliss & Pash work at (Andrew Wilson, Jimmy Fallon and Carlo Alban respectively), but this is mainly about Bliss, her family, Pash and the derby team.\r\n\r\nFINAL SAY: The drama in this coming-of-age flick is a mixed bag; I found the love story kind of tedious but enjoyed Pash and the family dynamics of the Cavendar household. The best part, of course, is the derby action and the ravishing derby babes in all their glory.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 111 minutes and was mostly filmed in Michigan (Detroit, Saline, Ypsilanti, Michigan, Birch Run and Hamtramck) with some shots of Austin, TX.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B", "created_at": "2020-11-02T19:25:15.913Z"}]
