say even though she wasn't suppose to go outside she did it anyways and at first I was a little confused because I was like this is just like everything everything so what is the point of watching it but in everything everything she didn't die and that made me realize how amazing the movie is and how better it is because when you think about it its dumb of her to risk her life but at the same time the time was gonna come and they all knew it so instead of her dying inside a house and not being able to experience anything was like why but she died happy and she knew how she wanted to that's exactly why she did it and I know it's only a movie but don't be afraid to live life to the fullest because me I always think how do I wanna do this do I wanna upset my parents but sometimes I wanna die but it will upset them and I just want everyone to be happy just like her and I love this movie because it inspires me to do better in life and don't let anyone or anything hold me back from being me and living life and it made me realize something risk life for love its beautiful and everyone should be happy", "created_at": "2018-08-26T23:49:47.512Z"}, {"movie_id": 419478, "review_id":
