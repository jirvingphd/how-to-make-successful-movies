Once again, Shane played multiple roles in the creation of this film \u2013 producer (one of), director, writer, actor (one of), music director, cinematographer and editor (one of). The film was made with a tiny budget of $50,000, wow, talk about being efficient. The story is not a convoluted one like Primer, which was based on time travel. That said, it\u2019s not very straightforward either. It does talk about some unreal patterns and could get hard to understand at times. Do give it a watch if you haven\u2019t already.", "created_at": "2019-01-23T13:50:57.440Z"}]
