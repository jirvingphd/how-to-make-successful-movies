The film has a lot to say and does it well, wading through layers of stinging dialogue, sophisticated observations, and lots and lots of vomit.\r\n\r\nThe film is a lot more than its now-infamous fifteen minute puking scene, however.

If not a recipe for disaster, it certainly sets the stage for an interesting few days at sea. But after the ship encounters a vicious storm and capsizes, the handful of survivors are left stranded on a deserted island and fighting for survival.\r\n\r\nThe film has a lot to say about feminism, sexism, today\u2019s social-media obsessed society, the gross exploitation of the working class, the conflicts between the haves and have-nots, the shallowness of the fashion industry, and lots more.\r\n\r\nWhile it would\u2019ve been the easier route to demonize the billionaires in his story, \u00d6stlund instead chooses to make them appropriately ostentatious yet still kind of likeable.

Initially, it centres around the fairly tempestuous relationship between models \"Carl\" (Harris Dickinson) and \"Yaya\" (Charlbi Dean). The latter is an influencer who looks at their relationship as something more transient; he is much more besotted - and so vows to make her fall in enduring love with him. Off onto a luxury yacht they head for an holiday with a few millionaires run by the super-officious \"Paula\" (Vicki Berlin) and captained by the dipsomaniac Woody Harrelson. The two befriend the lively and charismatic Russian oligarch \"Dimitry\" (Zlatlo Buric) and his wife \"Vera\" (Sunnyi Melles) before a captain's dinner that the choppy seas ensure ends in a messy and entertaining disaster! The remainder of their adventure has something of the \"Admirable Crichton\" to it, as they must adapt to the command of their erstwhile toilet cleaner \"Abigail\" (Dolly De Leon) who exacts her own unique sort of fees from her erstwhile patrons in return for catching fish and lighting fires... It does take a ping at the vacuousness of the modelling industry and at the unscrupulousness of big business - best exemplified in one scene with Oliver Ford Davies and Amanda Walker as the demure Brits who made their fortune selling \"the greatest single contribution to democracy\" (hand grenades!). Sadly, though, the moments of humour are relatively short and sweet when put into the context of this lengthy and frequently rather dull enterprise. Dickinson looks great shirtless, but as an actor he has limitations and I didn't really feel much chemistry between him and, well, anyone else. The last half hour could have been better, funnier, had there been a slight sense of menace - but somehow I just knew that the ending was going to deliver they way it does. Buric adds value, as does Henrik Dorsin's gazillionaire \"Jarmo\" but by half way through the joke had worn too thin to sustain it and I was a little bored. Doesn't need a big screen, and co-produced by the BBC I expect it can wait for Christmas television for most of us.", "created_at": "2022-11-03T08:30:07.553Z"}, {"movie_id": 497828, "review_id": "638505ca1b157d008245543c", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "sketched, never completed\r\n\r\nLooks like the director/writer had some notes, and didn't get around to write a complete script. So the movie starts out very promising, but then gradually runs out of ideas, until the last half is just ticking off the boxes of expected items.\r\n\r\nThe quirky, funny look into modelling is followed by a well cast and (in some moments) acted part about relationship issues between inexperienced, clueless, and selfish people. \r\nWe learn that the na\u00efve male model is actually in love, while his female model/influencer counterpart tells him he's nice entertainment until she finds a rich guy to be trophy wife for. This doesn't deter him... and that was the promising bit. \r\n\r\nNext, they are on a luxury yacht for the decadents; and there is still potential for a really good story: the upstairs/downstairs angle is only implemented in a few scenes, most screen time of this part is spent on lavish dining with icky \"haute cuisine\" food in rough seas, and the consequences thereof.\r\n\r\nThat was when the really good part could've started: how to they meet or avoid gazes the next day, the day after? What has changed, how, what shouldn't and how do class barriers break?\r\n\r\nInstead, we get a clownish intermezzo and next, the boring island section.

The film has a lot to say and does it well, wading through layers of stinging dialogue, sophisticated observations, and lots and lots of vomit.\r\n\r\nThe film is a lot more than its now-infamous fifteen minute puking scene, however. It\u2019s an in-your-face story that doesn\u2019t shy away from confronting everything from the rampant abuse of the less privileged to the primitive savagery of human nature.\r\n\r\nInstagram influencers and celebrity model couple Carl (Harris Dickinson) and Yaya (Charlbi Dean) are invited on an all-expenses-paid vacation on a luxury cruise in exchange for expert promotion on social media. The ritzy yacht is frequented by ultra-rich passengers who demand the finest things in life (one of the early scenes features a helicopter air-dropping a couple of jars of Nutella in the ocean, which is hilarious because it\u2019s so ridiculous).\r\n\r\nAs Carl and Yaya settle in, they begin to meet their very wealthy fellow guests, including a couple of British arms dealers, a Russian oligarch (Zlatko Buric), and an unhinged Marxist boat captain (Woody Harrelson) who spends the majority of the cruise drunk and locked in his cabin. If not a recipe for disaster, it certainly sets the stage for an interesting few days at sea. But after the ship encounters a vicious storm and capsizes, the handful of survivors are left stranded on a deserted island and fighting for survival.\r\n\r\nThe film has a lot to say about feminism, sexism, today\u2019s social-media obsessed society, the gross exploitation of the working class, the conflicts between the haves and have-nots, the shallowness of the fashion industry, and lots more.\r\n\r\nWhile it would\u2019ve been the easier route to demonize the billionaires in his story, \u00d6stlund instead chooses to make them appropriately ostentatious yet still kind of likeable. They\u2019re not entirely jackasses, they\u2019re just mega-wealthy. Setting the film on a cruise ship is brilliant too, as they have a built-in class system between passengers and amongst the crew. The boat symbolizes the hierarchy of social classes, including the officers, the predominantly white \u201cface time\u201d staff, and the lower rungs that include the cooks, engineers, janitorial workers, and other people of color. It\u2019s satisfying to watch the pecking order not only completely dissolve but get turned upside down after the yacht sinks.
