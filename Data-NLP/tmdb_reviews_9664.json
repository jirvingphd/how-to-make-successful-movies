[{"movie_id": 9664, "review_id": "5de18acb3faba0001308f612", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "***Americans volunteers become fighter pilots in France during WW1***  \r\n\r\nBefore the USA enters WW1, a young Texas cowboy (James Franco) joins the Lafayette Escadrille in France, a squadron of American fighter pilots. The volunteers are trained and soon experience the glory, anxieties and horrors that go with air combat.  \r\n\r\n\u201cFlyboys\" (2006) was inspired by real events and comes in the tradition of similar WW1 aviation flicks \u201cThe Blue Max\u201d (1966) and \u201cAces High\" (1976). Whilst not great like the exceptional \u201cBlue Max,\u201d the blockbuster-ish \u201cFlyboys\u201d is more compelling than the mundane \u201cAces High,\u201d albeit a little marred by comic book storytelling (think \u201cLegends of the Fall\u201d). It\u2019s also significantly superior to the curiously unabsorbing \u201cThe Red Baron\u201d (2008). \r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s ambitious and nigh epic, but there are some contrived, unconvincing moments. For instance, the \u201cGerman spy\u201d part could\u2019ve been cut with no harm done, not to mention make for a more streamlined viewing experience. Yet I\u2019m glad that the film\u2019s not as one-dimensional as the realistic \u201cAces High\u201d (which, don\u2019t get me wrong, is a quality WW1 fighter pilot flick). For instance, \u201cFlyboys\u201d throws in a good trench sequence involving \u2018No Man\u2019s Land\u2019 that LOOKS convincing; too bad it\u2019s not believable at all (the way so-and-so easily saves so-and-so). \r\n\r\nEugene Skinner, the black pilot, was based on the real-life Eugene Jacques Bullard (the filmmakers just changed the surname). In real life Eugene hoped to join the Lafayette Escadrille, but they stopped receiving applicants by the summer of 1916 after accepting 38 American pilots. So, a few months later, Eugene joined the Lafayette Flying Corps on November 15, 1916.\r\n\r\nAs far as strafing downed aviators goes, it was considered dishonorable, but the movie suggests that a minority of ignoble pilots did so, which is reasonable.  In the film an ignoble German pilot strafes & kills an American, which is what later spurs an honorable German pilot to make amends in a pretty powerful scene. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes, and was shot in England (Buckinghamshire, Essex, Bedfordshire & Somerset House, Strand, London, with studio work done in Hertfordshire). PS: The lion, Whisky, was a real mascot for the squad, along with another named Soda.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B+", "created_at": "2019-11-29T21:16:59.209Z"}]
