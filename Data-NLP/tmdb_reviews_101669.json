Story has three criminal brothers on the run from a bank robbery gone wrong and they plan to hide out in their childhood home.

The narrative is not perfect, with leaps of faith required for some twists and credulity is stretched to breaking point, but with Rebecca De Mornay on fire as the mad matriarch, the flaws are easily forgiven. 8/10", "created_at": "2014-10-16T08:20:43.807Z"}, {"movie_id": 101669, "review_id": "543f7fdbc3a3685e45001349", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "I'm proud of my boys, they never forget their momma.\r\n\r\nExcellent remake of Troma's schlocky 80s original.
