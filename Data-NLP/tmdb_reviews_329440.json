She finally starts having a deek for her sister at a local place (no idea what it was as I had sort of switched off by this point) and the woman indicates her sister is downstairs. Blondie walks down to the basement of corpses and in true fashion to what we see so far is more offended by the smell than the fact her sister could be one of the rotting deceased found in the forest.

Some may be familiar with the backstory of the \u201creal\u201d _Forest_ and its disturbing legendary reputation. Of course the reference is reserved for Japan\u2019s Aokigahara Forest (a.k.a. \u201cSuicide Forest\u201d) at the geographical base of Mount Fuji where historically this has been the morbid albeit visually stimulating resting place for that country\u2019s despair-ridden segmented population to gravitate in hopes of ending their lives among the smothering trees and twisty hiking paths. Although the Aokigahara Forest (also nicknamed \u201cThe Sea of Tress\u201d) acts as the last tranquil location for those desperate souls that want to meet their spiritual Maker it also doubles as a scenic and sumptuous tourist attraction for outsiders that embrace the essence of such a colorfully green, wooded paradise. So given the compelling inspiration for such an intriguing and real-life model of a Japanese posh and plentiful tree trunk haven of exceptional beauty and mystery then why does The Forest not resonate with the convincing chills and thrills of a harried horror showcase meant to capture the true scary decadence of the Aokigahara Forest\u2019s mystique?\r\n\r\nThe motivating myth behind the genuine hysterics of an Asian region that distinctively boasts the world\u2019s second largest destination for suicidal tendencies should have been the selling point for this plodding, predictable doom-and-gloom chiller. Instead, The Forest cannot seem to distinguish the light from its treacherous trees while delivering a hollow. horror-made shell of ghostly paranoia that never really musters up any majestic titillation beyond its basic boo-link manufacturing. _The Forest\u2019s_ winning formula, as it seems, is to rely on flashbacks in its step-by-step storytelling, exhaustive close-up shots on the film\u2019s photogenic lead Natalie Dormer from TV\u2019s \u201cGames of Thrones\u201d (playing put-upon Sara and her twin sister simultaneously) and needling through the conventional creepy impulses that the movie routinely trots out in suggestive suspense mode.\r\n\r\nFirst-time director Jason Zada has an interesting premise in which to work his grim-inducing hocus-pocus as his nightmarish narrative had the potential to raise the stakes of psychological warfare between weak-minded human psyche fragility and the deceptive mask of nature\u2019s beautification. Zada and screenwriters Sarah Cornwell, Nick Antosca and Ben Katai never fluidly marry the concept of despair and detachment with the ominous histrionics of the ghoulish Aokigahara Forest folklore. The saddened study of loss and hopelessness in an exquisite and mystifying woodland of wonderment is sacrificed for a serviceable chiller that sputters in its generic sense of dread and devastation.\r\n\r\nDormer\u2019s Sara Price is on a menacing mission to find her missing identical twin sibling Jess in the Far East. Jess had decided to take a trip to Japan. The word got out that poor Jess was last seen frequenting the notorious Aokigahara Forest\u2013certainly not an encouraging sign for both the country\u2019s natives and visiting outsiders deeply intrigued by the Timberland of Terror. In addition to Sara wandering about to locate the absent Jess she must reconcile her personal demons  and confront the ghosts\u2013both the ones in her worried mindset and the evil-minded forest\u2019s creation\u2013as she seeks out her disappearing twin. Sara is against all odds to find her missing sibling in a wooded wasteland of hopelessness. Importantly, Sara must overcome her inner fears of depression, disillusionment and disorientation and poking around in the infamous Aokigahara is not helping matters in the least.\r\n\r\nThere is much that can be said about the lackluster presentation of _The Forest_. For starters, Dormer\u2019s startled siren Sara is supposed to be the fearing female presence with a decent lifestyle back in the States although still tackling her traumatic baggage from a questionable upbringing. The audience does get the uncanny bond that Dormer\u2019s twin sibs share in both triumph and tragedy. No doubt that Zada tries to position the emotional and mental bridge of his look-a-like pretty protagonists and tailor a sordid background of frightening forethought that especially consumes the erratic Sara. Yet with all the set-up in place (Aokigahara\u2019s spooky backstory, imperiled sisterhood, etc.) Zada seems to struggle in incorporating any convincing sizzle that can propel The Forest into a cultural creepfest that really tantalizes.\r\n\r\nDormer\u2019s Sara is reduced to frantically running into the shadowy woods and giving off jittery vibes to the spontaneous apparitions that pop in and out. Surprisingly, _The Forest_ never seizes the moment to embrace the inherent value of the Aokigahara\u2019s deadly hypnotism for life-ending finality. Perhaps even if basing this horror film on the real-life suicidal indignation of \u201cSuicide Forest\u201d there probably would be major criticism about exploiting a Japanese tourist territory and its reprehensible reputation attached just to give a Hollywood horror showcase entertaining credibility. Still, this potential controversy might have given The Forest an upgrade in its otherwise mechanical and sluggish execution.\r\n\r\n_The Forest_ tosses around a few supporting characters to surround Dormer\u2019s damsel-in-distress Sara but to no real effect. Japanese tourist guide Michi (Yukiyoshi Ozawa) and journalist Aiden (Taylor Kinney) join Sara in her quest to track down Jess. Michi, using common sense, abandons the remaining twosome after learning that Sara insists on sticking around the forbidden forest as the darkness of night approaches. Thus, this gives Aiden a fighting chance to intimately cozy up to the determined Sara while covering an expose on the tedious travels through the scenic but sinister woods. Of course, the introduction of the Yurei (the harrowing woods-based spirits that supposedly influence the suicidal urges of its doomed visitors) is in full force to badger the beleaguered Sara as they reinforce her embedded delusions.\r\n\r\nSome bright spots do redeem _The Forest\u2019s_ presentation such as Mattias Troelstrup\u2019s crisp camerawork and the haunting and surreal visuals of strung-up stiff corpses hanging from the trees that accentuate the eeriness of lifeless souls lost in hidden pain. Otherwise, Zada\u2019s thin and jittery payoff is nothing more than a toothless trek through the pseudo petrified _Forest_.\r\n\r\nThe Forest (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr. 35 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Natalie Dormer, Taylor Kinney and Yukiyoshi Ozawa\r\n\r\nDirected by: Jason Zada\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror/Psychological Thriller\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng  2016", "created_at": "2016-01-30T07:49:52.107Z"}, {"movie_id": 329440, "review_id": "58318aeac3a3685b9d024730", "author_rating": 3.0, "review_text": "I gained absolutely nothing from this experience bar the knowledge that Natalie Dormer makes for an attractive goth.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing.
