Sir Kenneth Branagh starts off by giving us a little of the somewhat tragic WWI backstory to the famous Belgian detective before we are introduced to the newlywed \"Doyle\" couple Gal Gadot and Armie Hammer, his disgruntled ex girlfriend \"Jackie\" (Emma Mackey - whom I could have sworn was Margot Robbie) and an assembled cast aboard the luxury Nile paddle steamer \"Karnak\" where murder and mayhem ensue. A great deal of care has been taken with this production, and it looks great. That said, though, I found the characterisations pretty sterile; there are stars here but not (Annette Bening notwithstanding) big stars, and we get to know little of the personalities or grudges of the suspects. Tom Bateman reprises his role as \"Book\" from Sir Kenneth's other, equally flawed, \"Poirot\" outing back in 2017, but that stretches coincidence just a bit too much! There is little, if any humour, and though I did initially enjoy the 1930s Blues music it started to intrude a bit as the film progressed.

Somehow, Sir Kenneth just isn't \"Poirot\" for me. His performances are always just a little bit too theatrical - he always has to be centre stage.

A great deal of care has been taken with this production, and it looks great.
