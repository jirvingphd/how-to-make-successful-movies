It is in Korean with English subtitles, with a few bursts of English with Korean subtitles when the speaker is American.\r\n\r\nThe movie focuses on one family\u2019s ongoing battle: not merely against the monster but also struggling against the authorities who want to capture them, suspecting they have been infected with a virus by coming in contact with the creature.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is pretty ordinary. I seem to recall a few unintentionally funny moments, though I cannot say for sure that it wasn\u2019t due to the translation. I don\u2019t intend to be hyper critical here: I sort of let the movie wash over me to get to the end, and you may or may not need to do the same.\r\n\r\nI found I was a little confused as to the final fate of one of the family members at the end. Perhaps I was inattentive and it would have been cleared up if I backed it up and watched again, but unfortunately I wasn\u2019t quite inversted in the movie enough to do that.
