It has the tone & setting of \u201cUrban Legend\u201d (1998), but without the slasher aspect. It\u2019s also reminiscent in some ways of \u201cAn American Werewolf in Paris\u201d (1997), albeit obviously omitting the lycanthropes.\r\n\r\nThe production values are top-notch for the genre and era, but I found Melissa Sagemiller uninteresting as the protagonist. However, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, Eliza (No Booty) Dushku and Angela Featherstone are all interesting. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that the story isn\u2019t compelling enough, although the climax is revelatory and moving. Speaking of which, the movie\u2019s a mystery concerning life & death issues. It brings to mind a cult film from the early 60s, but I can\u2019t say its name because I don\u2019t want to give anything away. While \u201cSoul Survivors\u201d recalls that flick, it\u2019s different enough to stand on its own. So even if you go in knowing it shares plot elements with that particular film it won\u2019t ruin your viewing experience.    \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, and was shot in the Chicago area, including Evanston and the corresponding Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C", "created_at": "2019-08-06T18:21:22.158Z"}]
