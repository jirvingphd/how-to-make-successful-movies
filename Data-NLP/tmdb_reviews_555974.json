Let me clear, I didn't **love** it. I didn't think it was **great**. But there was some stuff I liked, and overall I thought that people were maybe a little too harsh on it. Well _Brahms_ ruins everything about _The Boy_ that I felt was worth defending. I had about three nice things that I thought could be said of _The Boy_, and _Brahms_ not only doesn't have those same things (Remember me saying that the first one has a cast capable of pulling off the premise? Well this one sure doesn't) but also actively works to undo the things that I felt made _The Boy_ any good at all. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._", "created_at": "2020-07-26T07:13:25.278Z"}]
