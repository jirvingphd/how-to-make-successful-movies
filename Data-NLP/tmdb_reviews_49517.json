Also, one has to be very attentive to the names of the various characters, and their role in the film, or we will never understand the plot while watching the film.", "created_at": "2022-06-18T12:14:33.669Z"}, {"movie_id": 49517, "review_id": "62daf421dff66e004c3528ef", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "Many folks will remember the wonderful BBC adaptation of this John Le Carr\u00e9 story that featured the late Sir Alec Guinness as the measured and sagely \"George Smiley\" character. This time, this almost as superior adaptation places an on-form Gary Oldman in that role. What role? Well having just been pensioned off, he is re-recruited by \"C\" (John Hurt) to try and track down a KGB spy deep within the fabric of MI6. It's fair to say that, as this story starts to unfold, we discover there are plenty of suspects and the classily written story bombards us with characterful and suspicious scenarios that might be true, might be half-true, or might just be genuine red herrings! A formidable cast of British stalwarts add richness to this complex but not convoluted tale of deceit and betrayal. Tom Hardy, Colin Firth and even the usually unimpressive Mark Strong chip in well but my plaudits go to the truly odiously ambitious Toby Jones (\"Alieline\") and to Benedict Cumberbatch's \"Guillam\". Tomas Alfredson has paced this film well. It can appear slow at times, but on the second time of watching I appreciated there was much more substance to some of the dialogue, the nuanced efforts from the stars and from a very well crafted period production. It just goes to show that less can definately be more when the writing and acting do all the heavy lifting in concert, leaving the pyrotechnics and visual effects in their boxes.", "created_at": "2022-07-22T19:01:53.182Z"}]
