And I'm sure if you can look past all that, then you can appreciate this veil metaphor of the sexes and a very well written story.\r\n\r\nNothing about this is fantastic, but it's a solidly good romantic comedy.", "created_at": "2020-08-14T00:42:12.327Z"}, {"movie_id": 20943, "review_id": "642ce771cca7de0103a9ce68", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "Butler's movies are not hard to watch at all.
