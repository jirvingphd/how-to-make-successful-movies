CJ Adams gives a respectable and sweet performance as Timothy, while Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton bring the heart in their roles as Cindy and James. The other characters are absolutely terrible, I will say that - especially Rosemarie DeWitt's Brenda.\r\n\r\nWhat it severely lacks in a supporting cast, it makes up for with its hearty narrative and nicely paced story. I don't think it's perfect or anything close, but it brings the feels that it intended to bring. Definitely worth a watch.", "created_at": "2020-11-12T04:35:05.614Z"}]
