The geeky, shy, young \"Peter Parker\" bitten by a genetically-modified spider that endows him with superhuman powers, decides to use his newly-found prowess for good. Dressed only in a pair of loosely converted pyjamas, he polices the streets at night apprehending thugs and petty criminals whilst during the day he remains the butt of jokes and pranks at school - usually at the hands of school heart-throb/dim-wit \"Flash\" (Joe Manganiello). He is best friends with \"Harry\" (the handsome, but pretty ineffective James Franco) who is not only the son of mega-rich scientist \"Norman Osborn\" (Willem Dafoe) but who is also dating his own dream girl \"Mary Jane\" (Kirsten Dunst). When his board try to take the \"Osborn\" company away from him, Dafoe starts experimenting with drugs that transfer him from a megalomanic scientist into - well a megalomanic \"Green Goblin\" - and it falls to \"Spidey\" to save the city and, of course, get his gal. Maguire is engaging in this, he has a glint in his eye and he enters into the spirit of this light-hearted fantasy adventure well. The writing is good in places, if a little too earnest at times, and the visual effects work well. They don't overwhelm the acting - maybe because the spider skills are inherently a little less showy - and this allows the story to focus more on a few engaging characterisations. JK Simmons is good as newspaper editor \"Jameson\" and there are a few nice cameos scenes from Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as his uncle and aunt. Sam Raimi has kept the pace tight, there is plenty of action peppered with some humour, some ham from Dafoe and a decent amount of scary science to keep this moving along well for two hours.", "created_at": "2023-09-03T06:44:15.819Z"}]
