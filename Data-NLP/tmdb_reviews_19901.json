I'm not usually the biggest fan of vampire films, or zombie ones for that matter (I'm more a fan of classic slashers like\u00a0Halloween\u00a0and\u00a0Friday the 13th) but this one wasn't too bad, aside from the occasional terrible CGI blood. Also helped that the film has Willem Dafoe in it, who I wish was the central character (though Hawke was by no means bad).", "created_at": "2019-08-29T20:53:10.787Z"}]
