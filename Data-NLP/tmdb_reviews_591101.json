It shows the unfortunate mirror to the audience how deep-rooted the patriarchal system is in our country and how it affects the psyche of a potential rapist. Very good acting by the debutant Vishal Jethwa as a psycho rapist and Rani Mukerjee in her best. I can't imagine anyone else doing the role of Shivani Shivaji Roy.\r\n\r\nMust watch for everyone.", "created_at": "2020-03-12T05:46:57.450Z"}]
