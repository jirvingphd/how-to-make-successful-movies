Plot has James Tupper and Anne Heche as a religious family moving to Stull, Kansas, a place rumoured to contain one of the Gateways to Hell. Pretty soon it\u2019s evident that the locals are not all they seem to be, trouble is is that the makers take an age for anything of note to really happen on the screen, and when it does the intended frights and terror are tepidly played. Clancy Brown gives his character some plausible heft, Rebekah Brandes gives the best performance as the troubled teen striving to save her sister, but everything in the second half of the film falls apart; or down a giant plot hole if you prefer! the cool ending saves it from total damnation, mind. 5/10", "created_at": "2014-11-02T02:45:34.430Z"}]
