Especially egregious is the pretentious way in which the filmmaker takes a position of haughty moral indignation and attempts to guilt-trip his own audience for wanting to watch a horror film in the first place. We know what he wanted to achieve with this movie, because he has told us explicitly; and he thought so highly of his achievement that he decided to make the film twice, shot-for-shot. Every scene is deliberately calculated to be as awkward to watch and as boring as possible, since anti-suspense is part of the \"point\". It is essentially the writer/director giving a middle finger to anyone willing to sit through this finger-wagging tripe.", "created_at": "2023-11-05T16:55:51.461Z"}]
