I don\u2019t recall one part of this film which I sat an thoroughly enjoyed. So if he had been shaved and made up, maybe then I would have had that slight bit of entertainment.\r\n\r\nSo we start off and the obviously attractive babysitter girl rocks up at obviously isolated house and an obviously good looking guy is there to greet here, what a fucking groundbreaking start! She walks into the strangers house even though they haven\u2019t even came down to greet her which in my opinion is just damned bad manners so I\u2019m already sat hoping potfingers fucks her up a bit for being so stereotypical. \r\n\r\nThe couple she\u2019s working for come downstairs and lo and behold as if the title didn\u2019t give it away, it\u2019s not a child\u2026\u2026\u2026.it\u2019s a fucking doll. I have to say as well the creepy doll bears resemblance to an 8 year old peadophile. She gets a set of rules which you can see her already disregarding inside her head as she\u2019s taught how to put a doll in PJs and tuck it up for the night, at this point I would have been ordering Dominos and a truck tonne of movies on the sly for the easy time ahead. \r\nThere\u2019s an attic. As if this movie couldn\u2019t be anymore fucking original - we now have a mysterious attic where the audience is supposed to wonder what happens beyond the ladder! I did not, I wondered when is this going to end as I can feel my mind thinking about going back to the Indian takeaway I\u2019ve left downstairs for morning.  I mean she ends up going to explore the attic NAKED, as if I couldn\u2019t be more frustrated at how unoriginal this is, like a lot of other current horrors it has quickly gone down the road to try and make you focus on the potential tits rather than how fucking bored you are by the plot.\r\nI\u2019d wrote a decent amount of things to comment on for after the film but truth be told - all I can say to truly summarise it would be Hollywood horror. The jumps are cheap, the twists are obvious and Brahms (child) just turns into more of a pervert as the movie progresses. If the girl was feeling that fucked up by what was happening surely you\u2019d just get a heavy object and smash his porcelain face in? Well, being quicker about doing this anyways. (OOPS spoiler alert, but if you hadn\u2019t seen that coming then I\u2019m going to guess you\u2019re someone who watched this and thought it was pure golden). \r\n\r\nIf you ask me, all Brahms wanted was a bit of action judging by him acting like a randy teenager during the movie, even encased in a pot shell there was no stopping the lad from trying to scope her in the shower.

A young American woman named Greta, takes up a nanny job in England to escape from the troubled relationship with her boyfriend. She discovers the boy she has to look out is a doll and later she observes a series of strange events that leads her to find out the truth.

Not because of the bad conclusion, but comparing it with the rest, especially after the anticipation it created in us, that end part looked so small and simple.

In either case, both scenarios are routinely realized and does not look to change at any time in the immediate future. Director William Brent Bell\u2019s (\u2018The Devil Inside\u2019) latest banal boofest **\u2018The Boy\u2019** is basically business as usual in terms of registering as a flaccid fright fable pitted in the dumping ground of released duds in the relatively new year. In essence, \u2018The Boy\u2019 is one stillborn terrorizing tyke born out of artificial and tired creepy conventions.\r\n\r\nSure, **The Boy** has its share of atmospheric chills and, as a production, it exudes a tension-filled anxiousness courtesy of the polished Gothic-induced vibes in gives off in its sinister-looking set designs. Nevertheless, **The Boy** fails to hold our attention where it truly counts in structured, solid storytelling and viable psychological thrills. Instead, Bell\u2019s pat knee-shaking narrative spends its time focusing on the familiar and flawed cliches involving meager melodramatic plot developments, recycled unnatural occurrences, the movie\u2019s harried heroine and her beleaguered backstory and annoying jolts and tiresome false jump starts in manufactured suspense. Of course, \u2018The Boy\u2019s panic playground for its horrific happenings takes place in a spacious and darkened manor populated by eccentric occupants and their devoted, demonic doll (hence, \u2018the boy\u2019 in question).\r\n\r\nAmerican Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan, \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019) travels across the pond to start over in the quaint English countryside as she leaves behind the fragments of a bad relationship back the States. Greta looks to pursue a job opportunity as a nanny for the Heelshire couple (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle) at their expansive estate. The Heelshires need Greta for tending to their son Brahms\u2019s personal affairs. The unusual discovery from the newly hired nanny, however, is that Greta\u2019s task is to watch Brahms, a porcelain doll and NOT a human little boy. The Heelshires, out of touch with reality, treats the inanimate tot as a real son. Nevertheless, a job is a job so Greta minds the toy tyke when his \u2018parents\u2019 decide to go away for the holiday.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Greta learns about the histrionics pertaining to the Heelshires and Brahms through their deliveryman Malcolm (Rupert Evans). The Heelshires\u2019 disillusionment originated nearly two decades ago when the original and real-life Brahms died in a tragic fire. This, of course, reveals the questionable quirks about the boy\u2019s maturing parents\u2019 behavior and denial mode in substituting the doll conveniently for their belated and beloved son Brahms. Greta is determined to do right by the Heelshires and treat Brahms with the compassion they imaged her duties would entail. Importantly, Greta must make a good impression on the unassuming boy doll as the Heelshires warned that Brahms has had his troubles with past nannies.\r\n\r\nAt first Greta is pensive to react to Brahms and leaves him sitting idle in the corner. The Heelshires had given specific instructions on how to handle their precious \u201cboy\u201d as they have naturally spoiled him with amounts of attention.  Greta eventually finds the nerve to cater to Brahms\u2019s every caretaking whims and soon expresses a fondness for him in the process. So far, so good, right?\r\n\r\n**The Boy** certainly has its moments of shock value but the sluggish story feels lukewarm for the most part. Bell and screenwriter Stacey Manear cobble together a mysterious and moody horror thriller that is somewhat old-fashioned as it relies on tension-building tactics involving shadowy hallways, dim-light rooms and innuendo scares that suggest more meat to the bone when spotlighting everything from Brahms\u2019s aura of the present to the deceased Brahms\u2019s existence of the past. Both Bell and Manear arm **The Boy\u2019s** leading lady Cohan/Greta with personal issues meant to carry over to the English landscape but the malaise she possesses comes off as matter-of-factly. And who really did not telegraph Greta\u2019s ex-main squeeze Cole showing up in England to claim his woman\u2019s heart only to meet some static concerning the clingy Brahms?\r\n\r\nIt is such a shame that The Boy could not capitalize any further on its strange and hypnotic inclinations. After all, this off-kilter narrative had the makings for a psychological masking of paranoia and possessiveness but never quite taps into the underscored hedonistic hold that exists between Greta and toyish tot Brahms or Brahms and the salacious spells of the manor where his dubious presence exists. Sadly, the slow burn effectiveness of The Boy stutters especially when revisiting the titillating genre of disturbing dolls and the mayhem they spin towards their hapless human counterparts (yeah, at least **Chucky** and **Magic\u2019s** dummy Fats had some genuine gory gumption to bring to the terrifying table).\r\n\r\nWhat is maddening about **The Boy** is the wasted potential of what perhaps could have been a whacked-out gem that exploited the surreal circumstances of mental and emotional loss and elusive reality. Instead, the intended suspense is as solitary and stiff as the bratty Brahms\u2019s compact body.\r\n\r\n**The Boy** (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr. 37 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Lauren Cohan, Rupert Evans, Diana Hardcastle, James Russell, Jim Norton\r\n\r\nDirected by: William Brent Bell\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror/Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016", "created_at": "2016-02-08T06:47:09.561Z"}, {"movie_id": 321258, "review_id": "5737586792514115a1000acc", "author_rating": 6.0, "review_text": "> When a nanny meets a boy who is a weird toy.\r\n\r\nSo this is the other 'The Boy'.
