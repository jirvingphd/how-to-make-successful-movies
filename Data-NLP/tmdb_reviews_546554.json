Therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. Before the film, I can\u2019t deny that I was indeed affected by the whole \u201ca whodunnit like you haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d I went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. It\u2019s uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a \u201cbad\u201d movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn\u2019t, he did other stuff, you know?). It\u2019s one of those films everyone knows it\u2019s going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.\r\n\r\nEven the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole \u201cbest X of the decade,\u201d I\u2019m going one step beyond). This is a film I know I\u2019m going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who \u201cdid it,\u201d the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn\u2019t need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.\r\n\r\nThis screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell\u2019s). It\u2019s been half-a-day since I\u2019ve seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there\u2019s an answer lying on someone\u2019s words or actions. It\u2019s such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it\u2019s impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.\r\n\r\nI genuinely love the first act, even if it\u2019s the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn\u2019t waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It\u2019s through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn\u2019t, then it does again\u2026\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons I couldn\u2019t figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel \u201cintellectually superior\u201d just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time\u2019s up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, \u201cI guessed it,\u201d there\u2019s a 99% chance that they\u2019re either lying or not answering correctly to the question \u201cwho killed Harlan?\u201d If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m trying to express.\r\n\r\n(I don\u2019t want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I\u2019m not trying to say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure it out, so no one can.\u201d Please, if you haven\u2019t seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)\r\n\r\nThroughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera\u2019s (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I\u2019ve been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I\u2019m ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he\u2019s been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it\u2019s sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.\r\n\r\nMy only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It\u2019s like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell\u2019s Jacob and Katherine Langford\u2019s Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act\u2019s interrogatories. It\u2019s great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I\u2019ve ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he\u2019s a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess \u201cwho did it\u201d beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It\u2019s an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative.

A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy. The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain. Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences. Perfectly balance, as all things should be. It basically pulls a Hitchcock on us.\r\n\r\nRian Johnson is a great director, but at times has silly ideas. On the other hand, when given the right material I think he\u2019s a great director and writer. He\u2019s also a clever man, but never came off as annoying. The dialogue was so sharply written that I could tell the cast loved every minute of soaking up and delivering these lines. The cinematography was nothing short but beautiful and will often linger in rooms of the house which helps the audience immerse in the overall setting.\r\n\r\nOne of the tightest scripts of the year with raw humor and a satisfying mystery/comedy.\r\n\r\nThe cast is stellar, but the main stand outs for me were Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. I loved Daniel Craig\u2019s Southern drawl which I didn\u2019t expect at first, but I was amazed of how far he went for it. Often times it reminded me of Frank Underwood from \u2018House of Cards\u2019. He plays detective Benoit Blanc, AKA CSI: KFC. At one point during the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie, which was brilliantly delivered by Craig. He should seriously try out more comedy roles.\r\n\r\nDose anyone remember when Ana de Armas starred in Eli Roth\u2019s \u2018Knock Knock\u2019? Well look at her now. She was absolutely excellent in this movie. The running joke throughout the entire movie is her character can\u2019t lie and whenever she dose, she vomits on the spot. How ironic, yet I love the comedic irony behind it.\r\n\r\nChris Evans plays a spoiled child with a slimy grin during the worst situations. The over privilege black sheep of the family. This is very against type for Evans, especially when his character hates dogs, which I would imagine being difficult for Evans since he\u2019s a dog lover in real life. Also the different sweaters he wears in every scenes was impeccable.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast manage to shine individually in this crowded movie. Although at times some of them felt like background wall paper compared to others. However that never takes away from what else \u2018Knives Out\u2019 has to offer.\r\n\r\nToni Collette dose a great impression of Gwyneth Paltrow. Michael Shannon plays a wimpy son to a crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Despite the small screen time, Plummer is still charming as always. While Jamie Lee Curtis and her character brings the dramatic elements into play. She\u2019s uninterested in the humorous quarrel during the grim situation, as early on she reminds everyone that her father just died.\r\n\r\nJudging it as a whodunit mystery, the pay off itself is slick. The events leading to the death are revealed early into the movie, and instead Johnson remains steps ahead from the audience. There\u2019s an underlining social commentary beneath the foul play. The themes of privilege and underprivileged with the sour taste of bitterness throughout. Nothing deep or new, but at least is trying to say something rather than being one thing.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: My House. My Rules.

Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.\r\n\r\nIn Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.\r\n\r\nNot only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an \"Anti-Captain America \"; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes!

Then, honestly, anyone who says, \u201cI guessed it,\u201d there\u2019s a 99% chance that they\u2019re either lying or not answering correctly to the question \u201cwho killed Harlan?\u201d If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m trying to express.\r\n\r\n(I don\u2019t want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I\u2019m not trying to say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure it out, so no one can.\u201d Please, if you haven\u2019t seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)\r\n\r\nThroughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera\u2019s (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I\u2019ve been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I\u2019m ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he\u2019s been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it\u2019s sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.\r\n\r\nMy only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It\u2019s like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell\u2019s Jacob and Katherine Langford\u2019s Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act\u2019s interrogatories. It\u2019s great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I\u2019ve ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he\u2019s a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess \u201cwho did it\u201d beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It\u2019s an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative.

A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy. The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain. Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences. Perfectly balance, as all things should be. It basically pulls a Hitchcock on us.\r\n\r\nRian Johnson is a great director, but at times has silly ideas. On the other hand, when given the right material I think he\u2019s a great director and writer. He\u2019s also a clever man, but never came off as annoying. The dialogue was so sharply written that I could tell the cast loved every minute of soaking up and delivering these lines. The cinematography was nothing short but beautiful and will often linger in rooms of the house which helps the audience immerse in the overall setting.\r\n\r\nOne of the tightest scripts of the year with raw humor and a satisfying mystery/comedy.\r\n\r\nThe cast is stellar, but the main stand outs for me were Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. I loved Daniel Craig\u2019s Southern drawl which I didn\u2019t expect at first, but I was amazed of how far he went for it. Often times it reminded me of Frank Underwood from \u2018House of Cards\u2019. He plays detective Benoit Blanc, AKA CSI: KFC. At one point during the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie, which was brilliantly delivered by Craig. He should seriously try out more comedy roles.\r\n\r\nDose anyone remember when Ana de Armas starred in Eli Roth\u2019s \u2018Knock Knock\u2019? Well look at her now. She was absolutely excellent in this movie. The running joke throughout the entire movie is her character can\u2019t lie and whenever she dose, she vomits on the spot. How ironic, yet I love the comedic irony behind it.\r\n\r\nChris Evans plays a spoiled child with a slimy grin during the worst situations. The over privilege black sheep of the family. This is very against type for Evans, especially when his character hates dogs, which I would imagine being difficult for Evans since he\u2019s a dog lover in real life. Also the different sweaters he wears in every scenes was impeccable.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast manage to shine individually in this crowded movie. Although at times some of them felt like background wall paper compared to others. However that never takes away from what else \u2018Knives Out\u2019 has to offer.\r\n\r\nToni Collette dose a great impression of Gwyneth Paltrow. Michael Shannon plays a wimpy son to a crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Despite the small screen time, Plummer is still charming as always. While Jamie Lee Curtis and her character brings the dramatic elements into play. She\u2019s uninterested in the humorous quarrel during the grim situation, as early on she reminds everyone that her father just died.\r\n\r\nJudging it as a whodunit mystery, the pay off itself is slick. The events leading to the death are revealed early into the movie, and instead Johnson remains steps ahead from the audience. There\u2019s an underlining social commentary beneath the foul play. The themes of privilege and underprivileged with the sour taste of bitterness throughout. Nothing deep or new, but at least is trying to say something rather than being one thing.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: My House. My Rules.

Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.\r\n\r\nIn Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.\r\n\r\nNot only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an \"Anti-Captain America \"; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes!

Therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. Before the film, I can\u2019t deny that I was indeed affected by the whole \u201ca whodunnit like you haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d I went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. It\u2019s uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a \u201cbad\u201d movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn\u2019t, he did other stuff, you know?). It\u2019s one of those films everyone knows it\u2019s going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.\r\n\r\nEven the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole \u201cbest X of the decade,\u201d I\u2019m going one step beyond). This is a film I know I\u2019m going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who \u201cdid it,\u201d the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn\u2019t need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.\r\n\r\nThis screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell\u2019s). It\u2019s been half-a-day since I\u2019ve seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there\u2019s an answer lying on someone\u2019s words or actions. It\u2019s such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it\u2019s impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.\r\n\r\nI genuinely love the first act, even if it\u2019s the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn\u2019t waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It\u2019s through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn\u2019t, then it does again\u2026\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons I couldn\u2019t figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel \u201cintellectually superior\u201d just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time\u2019s up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, \u201cI guessed it,\u201d there\u2019s a 99% chance that they\u2019re either lying or not answering correctly to the question \u201cwho killed Harlan?\u201d If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m trying to express.\r\n\r\n(I don\u2019t want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I\u2019m not trying to say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure it out, so no one can.\u201d Please, if you haven\u2019t seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)\r\n\r\nThroughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera\u2019s (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I\u2019ve been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I\u2019m ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers.

Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it\u2019s sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.\r\n\r\nMy only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It\u2019s like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell\u2019s Jacob and Katherine Langford\u2019s Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act\u2019s interrogatories. It\u2019s great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I\u2019ve ever seen, Knives Out.

A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy. The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain. Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences. Perfectly balance, as all things should be. It basically pulls a Hitchcock on us.\r\n\r\nRian Johnson is a great director, but at times has silly ideas. On the other hand, when given the right material I think he\u2019s a great director and writer. He\u2019s also a clever man, but never came off as annoying. The dialogue was so sharply written that I could tell the cast loved every minute of soaking up and delivering these lines. The cinematography was nothing short but beautiful and will often linger in rooms of the house which helps the audience immerse in the overall setting.\r\n\r\nOne of the tightest scripts of the year with raw humor and a satisfying mystery/comedy.\r\n\r\nThe cast is stellar, but the main stand outs for me were Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. I loved Daniel Craig\u2019s Southern drawl which I didn\u2019t expect at first, but I was amazed of how far he went for it. Often times it reminded me of Frank Underwood from \u2018House of Cards\u2019. He plays detective Benoit Blanc, AKA CSI: KFC. At one point during the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie, which was brilliantly delivered by Craig. He should seriously try out more comedy roles.\r\n\r\nDose anyone remember when Ana de Armas starred in Eli Roth\u2019s \u2018Knock Knock\u2019? Well look at her now. She was absolutely excellent in this movie. The running joke throughout the entire movie is her character can\u2019t lie and whenever she dose, she vomits on the spot. How ironic, yet I love the comedic irony behind it.\r\n\r\nChris Evans plays a spoiled child with a slimy grin during the worst situations. The over privilege black sheep of the family. This is very against type for Evans, especially when his character hates dogs, which I would imagine being difficult for Evans since he\u2019s a dog lover in real life. Also the different sweaters he wears in every scenes was impeccable.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast manage to shine individually in this crowded movie. Although at times some of them felt like background wall paper compared to others. However that never takes away from what else \u2018Knives Out\u2019 has to offer.\r\n\r\nToni Collette dose a great impression of Gwyneth Paltrow. Michael Shannon plays a wimpy son to a crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Despite the small screen time, Plummer is still charming as always. While Jamie Lee Curtis and her character brings the dramatic elements into play. She\u2019s uninterested in the humorous quarrel during the grim situation, as early on she reminds everyone that her father just died.\r\n\r\nJudging it as a whodunit mystery, the pay off itself is slick. The events leading to the death are revealed early into the movie, and instead Johnson remains steps ahead from the audience. There\u2019s an underlining social commentary beneath the foul play. The themes of privilege and underprivileged with the sour taste of bitterness throughout. Nothing deep or new, but at least is trying to say something rather than being one thing.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: My House. My Rules.

Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.\r\n\r\nIn Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.\r\n\r\nNot only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an \"Anti-Captain America \"; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes!

Therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. Before the film, I can\u2019t deny that I was indeed affected by the whole \u201ca whodunnit like you haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d I went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. It\u2019s uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a \u201cbad\u201d movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn\u2019t, he did other stuff, you know?). It\u2019s one of those films everyone knows it\u2019s going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.\r\n\r\nEven the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole \u201cbest X of the decade,\u201d I\u2019m going one step beyond). This is a film I know I\u2019m going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who \u201cdid it,\u201d the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn\u2019t need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.\r\n\r\nThis screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell\u2019s). It\u2019s been half-a-day since I\u2019ve seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there\u2019s an answer lying on someone\u2019s words or actions. It\u2019s such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it\u2019s impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.\r\n\r\nI genuinely love the first act, even if it\u2019s the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn\u2019t waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It\u2019s through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn\u2019t, then it does again\u2026\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons I couldn\u2019t figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel \u201cintellectually superior\u201d just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time\u2019s up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, \u201cI guessed it,\u201d there\u2019s a 99% chance that they\u2019re either lying or not answering correctly to the question \u201cwho killed Harlan?\u201d If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m trying to express.\r\n\r\n(I don\u2019t want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I\u2019m not trying to say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure it out, so no one can.\u201d Please, if you haven\u2019t seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)\r\n\r\nThroughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera\u2019s (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I\u2019ve been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I\u2019m ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he\u2019s been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it\u2019s sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.\r\n\r\nMy only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It\u2019s like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell\u2019s Jacob and Katherine Langford\u2019s Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act\u2019s interrogatories. It\u2019s great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I\u2019ve ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he\u2019s a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess \u201cwho did it\u201d beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It\u2019s an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative.

Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.\r\n\r\nIn Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.\r\n\r\nNot only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an \"Anti-Captain America \"; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes!

It's a brilliant 131 minutes, even if it feels much shorter than that given how enjoyable it is.\r\n\r\nThe casting is impeccable. Daniel Craig is superb in the role of Blanc, I've actually found Craig a tad hit-and-miss - even with <em>'James Bond'</em> - but he is utterly superb here; even with that unusual yet definitely entertaining accent.\r\n\r\nIt's by no means The Craig Show, though. Ana de Armas is excellent as Marta, she does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of making her character's situation fully believable. She's great from start-to-finish.\r\n\r\nMichael Shannon is top notch too, I literally always find him fun to watch - from <em>'Boardwalk Empire'</em> to, even, <em>'Kangaroo Jack'</em>. Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield and Christopher Plummer are all fantastic too.\r\n\r\nThe plot is enthralling, it's crafted together expertly. It reveals bits way earlier than I was predicting, which made me worry it was going to all fall flat at any moment but it kept turning out to be the perfect time to twist the story.

Each character sees it for the first time when they are called for investigation by the police and who they are and what is their relationship to the victim.
