Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld), a fresh college graduate who becomes disillusioned by his limited career choices in the hive. Upon taking a special trip to the outside world his life is saved by Vanessa (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger), a beautiful florist in New York City. As their relationship develops, he discovers humans actually harvest honey by enslaving bees; and understandably decides to sue humanity, but this has repercussions.\r\n\r\nI'm not big on animated flicks, but this one has frequent laugh-out-loud moments, particularly the first half. But you have to pay attention to the rapid fire dialogue and the details in the frame or you'll miss out on half the laughs. Consider for, for example, the ATFH officer (What's the 'H'stand for?). The second half remains compelling, but is more low-key in amusement. Bottom line: \"Bee Movie\" is one of my all-time favorite comedies. By the way, I know Vanessa's animated, but she's actually HOT.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL VOICES are supplied by the likes of Matthew Broderick, Patrick Warburton, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Kathy Bates, Barry Levinson, Larry King, Ray Liotta, Sting, Oprah Winfrey and Rip Torn.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 91 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A", "created_at": "2018-12-31T16:05:50.361Z"}, {"movie_id": 5559, "review_id": "5c2a3e5e0e0a26541c384be0", "author_rating": 9.0, "review_text": "***A hilarious bee movie***  \r\n\r\nReleased in 2007, \"Bee Movie\" is an animated movie about a bee, Barry B.
