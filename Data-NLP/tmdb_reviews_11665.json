Just good clean, hilarious fun. Steve Carrell is in his sweet spot with all kinds of physical comedy and side-splitting sarcasm. This movie feels every bit like a spy comedy starring Michael Scott from the Office, except this time with a much bigger budget than Threat Level Midnight. I don't know how the cast could keep a straight face with Steve Carrell's performance as outrageous and entertaining as it was. Anne Hathaway was an excellent partner reacting to Carrell's nonsense with many of her own clever moments. Having watched re-runs of the original TV show with my grandparents growing up, it was easy to see how the movie honored the show's spirit while increasing the budget, effects, and laughs. Director Peter Segal has a resume filled with goofy films and several of which involve espionage and law enforcement, making him the perfect director for a movie like this. Get Smart's clean humor allows the whole family to enjoy its entertaining plot and dorky lovable characters.
