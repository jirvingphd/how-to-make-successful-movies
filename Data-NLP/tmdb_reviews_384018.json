Every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic\u2026 As long as it establishes its tone from the start. You can\u2019t make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldn\u2019t and take everything seriously. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t have that mix of tones (Furious 7 did it brilliantly), but that\u2019s reserved for some of the best movies of the year since it\u2019s not easy (at all) to balance so many different things. Hobbs & Shaw sets its tone in the first 10 minutes, and everyone knows what they\u2019re getting themselves into. However, it didn\u2019t quite work for me this time\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Fast & Furious saga is an undeniable success, even more in my country where it constantly breaks box-office records. It possesses everything a popcorn blockbuster should have: tons of action (car chases, explosions, fights, shootouts), easy-to-follow plot, and simple character development. There\u2019s no problem in leaving your brain at the entrance of the theater for a couple of hours and just have fun. Of course, Hobbs & Shaw is ridiculous. It\u2019s completely absurd, it has no sense of logic, and it\u2019s unbelievable how many physics-defying sequences occur. But that\u2019s exactly what they establish in those first few minutes, so people just need to sit comfortably and eat that whole bag of popcorn while watching the most ludicrous action on-screen.\r\n\r\nSo, if the tone is well-balanced, why didn\u2019t I enjoy it as much as the rest? People seem to be having tremendous fun (even critics who usually demolish this type of films are liking it), so I guess I\u2019m in the minority here, but I just found the action pretty underwhelming, and the comedy was way off for me. Granted, there are huge set pieces, and there are a couple of great action scenes, especially a motorbike-car chase between Brixton, Hobbs, and Shaw. True, there are a couple of laughs that I couldn\u2019t contain due to how amazing Statham and Johnson\u2019s chemistry is. Nevertheless, overall, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my main issue with the story: Brixton. Idris Elba is incredible as always, and I really want him to be the next James Bond. However, his character is so poorly written and so horribly explored that I wonder why they made him an enhanced machine with superpowers. Literally, there\u2019s no difference between him and the other two main characters, which ultimately destroys the \u201csuperhero\u201d vibe Elba should have. That\u2019s the problem with having such an absurd movie: if your \u201cheroes\u201d are undefeatable due to their enormous plot armor, how is your \u201csuperpowered villain\u201d different than them? If an explosion goes off with the three of them close, why do Hobbs and Shaw survive in the same way Brixton does? How does a punch from a \u201cblack Superman\u201d has the same impact as a punch from the other two? \r\n\r\nThen, the comedy. It\u2019s not like I disliked Statham and Johnson bantering for five straight minutes in three different scenes. It\u2019s just too long, and not all of the jokes land. The film itself is way too long, just over two hours. If I didn\u2019t know about the whole Samoa sequence from occasionally seeing it on a TV spot, I would have believed the movie was about to end when it started its third act. It feels like it\u2019s going to end, but then there\u2019s a whole other massive action set piece to show off. For the first time in a long, long time, I almost fell asleep during the transition from the second-to-last to the last action moment. The action is also very disappointing having in mind David Leitch is directing. Too many quick cuts, and way too choppy.\r\n\r\nFinally, there\u2019s an attempt at the start of a romance that I won\u2019t spoil, but \u2026 It\u2019s not like it\u2019s forced because it actually isn\u2019t. It follows a logical path, characters don\u2019t say stupid stuff to each other, and it was surprisingly being a good way of stopping to breathe and relax away from all the action. However, as the film reaches its conclusion, they ditch it altogether and never address it anymore. There\u2019s even a line similar to \u201cI\u2019ll let you have a kiss tomorrow if we\u2019re still alive\u201d, but they never go there again. It\u2019s like it never happened\u2026 Why? The only thing that was truly being logical and emotionally compelling is completely ignored by the end. That\u2019s disappointing.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to be too harsh on the movie because I do understand how entertaining and fun it might be. I\u2019m sure audiences will love it, and fans of the franchise will love it even more. The chemistry of the cast is palpable, and everyone is terrific. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are awesome as the action superstars, and they\u2019re definitely the main source of entertainment. Vanessa Kirby is also pretty great, and I have to commend the film for keeping two spectacular cameos under wraps. You won\u2019t believe who\u2019s in this movie as well. There are still a couple of cool action sequences, and I did laugh more than a couple of times, so I guess it isn\u2019t as bad as this review might transmit.\r\n\r\nI know I\u2019m in the minority, so I recommend all of you to go watch it and judge it for yourselves. If you enjoy absurdity, ridiculousness, and over-the-top action, as well as cheesy comedy, Hobbs & Shaw might be perfect for you. It didn\u2019t really work for me, though. The comedy was not as good as I expected, the action is not that captivating, and Brixton is such a horribly written and unexplored character, that I kept feeling frustrated every time an action sequence ended. Go for the huge set pieces and the dumb fun, stay for the amazing cast\u2019s chemistry. \r\nPS: if you haven\u2019t watched Game Of Thrones by now, heavy spoilers in this film.

Every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic\u2026 As long as it establishes its tone from the start. You can\u2019t make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldn\u2019t and take everything seriously. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t have that mix of tones (Furious 7 did it brilliantly), but that\u2019s reserved for some of the best movies of the year since it\u2019s not easy (at all) to balance so many different things. Hobbs & Shaw sets its tone in the first 10 minutes, and everyone knows what they\u2019re getting themselves into. However, it didn\u2019t quite work for me this time\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Fast & Furious saga is an undeniable success, even more in my country where it constantly breaks box-office records. It possesses everything a popcorn blockbuster should have: tons of action (car chases, explosions, fights, shootouts), easy-to-follow plot, and simple character development. There\u2019s no problem in leaving your brain at the entrance of the theater for a couple of hours and just have fun. Of course, Hobbs & Shaw is ridiculous. It\u2019s completely absurd, it has no sense of logic, and it\u2019s unbelievable how many physics-defying sequences occur. But that\u2019s exactly what they establish in those first few minutes, so people just need to sit comfortably and eat that whole bag of popcorn while watching the most ludicrous action on-screen.\r\n\r\nSo, if the tone is well-balanced, why didn\u2019t I enjoy it as much as the rest? People seem to be having tremendous fun (even critics who usually demolish this type of films are liking it), so I guess I\u2019m in the minority here, but I just found the action pretty underwhelming, and the comedy was way off for me. Granted, there are huge set pieces, and there are a couple of great action scenes, especially a motorbike-car chase between Brixton, Hobbs, and Shaw. True, there are a couple of laughs that I couldn\u2019t contain due to how amazing Statham and Johnson\u2019s chemistry is. Nevertheless, overall, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my main issue with the story: Brixton. Idris Elba is incredible as always, and I really want him to be the next James Bond. However, his character is so poorly written and so horribly explored that I wonder why they made him an enhanced machine with superpowers. Literally, there\u2019s no difference between him and the other two main characters, which ultimately destroys the \u201csuperhero\u201d vibe Elba should have. That\u2019s the problem with having such an absurd movie: if your \u201cheroes\u201d are undefeatable due to their enormous plot armor, how is your \u201csuperpowered villain\u201d different than them? If an explosion goes off with the three of them close, why do Hobbs and Shaw survive in the same way Brixton does? How does a punch from a \u201cblack Superman\u201d has the same impact as a punch from the other two? \r\n\r\nThen, the comedy. It\u2019s not like I disliked Statham and Johnson bantering for five straight minutes in three different scenes. It\u2019s just too long, and not all of the jokes land. The film itself is way too long, just over two hours. If I didn\u2019t know about the whole Samoa sequence from occasionally seeing it on a TV spot, I would have believed the movie was about to end when it started its third act. It feels like it\u2019s going to end, but then there\u2019s a whole other massive action set piece to show off. For the first time in a long, long time, I almost fell asleep during the transition from the second-to-last to the last action moment. The action is also very disappointing having in mind David Leitch is directing. Too many quick cuts, and way too choppy.\r\n\r\nFinally, there\u2019s an attempt at the start of a romance that I won\u2019t spoil, but \u2026 It\u2019s not like it\u2019s forced because it actually isn\u2019t. It follows a logical path, characters don\u2019t say stupid stuff to each other, and it was surprisingly being a good way of stopping to breathe and relax away from all the action. However, as the film reaches its conclusion, they ditch it altogether and never address it anymore. There\u2019s even a line similar to \u201cI\u2019ll let you have a kiss tomorrow if we\u2019re still alive\u201d, but they never go there again. It\u2019s like it never happened\u2026 Why? The only thing that was truly being logical and emotionally compelling is completely ignored by the end. That\u2019s disappointing.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to be too harsh on the movie because I do understand how entertaining and fun it might be. I\u2019m sure audiences will love it, and fans of the franchise will love it even more. The chemistry of the cast is palpable, and everyone is terrific. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are awesome as the action superstars, and they\u2019re definitely the main source of entertainment. Vanessa Kirby is also pretty great, and I have to commend the film for keeping two spectacular cameos under wraps. You won\u2019t believe who\u2019s in this movie as well. There are still a couple of cool action sequences, and I did laugh more than a couple of times, so I guess it isn\u2019t as bad as this review might transmit.\r\n\r\nI know I\u2019m in the minority, so I recommend all of you to go watch it and judge it for yourselves. If you enjoy absurdity, ridiculousness, and over-the-top action, as well as cheesy comedy, Hobbs & Shaw might be perfect for you. It didn\u2019t really work for me, though. The comedy was not as good as I expected, the action is not that captivating, and Brixton is such a horribly written and unexplored character, that I kept feeling frustrated every time an action sequence ended. Go for the huge set pieces and the dumb fun, stay for the amazing cast\u2019s chemistry. \r\nPS: if you haven\u2019t watched Game Of Thrones by now, heavy spoilers in this film.
