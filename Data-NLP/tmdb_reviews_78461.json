He's reminiscent of Robby Benson.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my title blurb, the story is akin to a Scooby-Doo yarn, but realistic and without the dog. Although Quaid is over-the-top and somewhat campy as the villain the rest of the cast play it straight. I was surprised by the dramatic score and a few really touching scenes.\r\n\r\nSome complain that the subplot of a dead sister and a ghost sighting goes nowhere, but it's there for a reason, just think about it.\r\n\r\nAlthough there's some realistic cussing there's zero raunch.\r\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised by this little film. It's classy, sometimes moving, mysterious and thrilling. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and shot in Bastrop & Smithville, Texas.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-", "created_at": "2021-06-25T20:00:46.962Z"}, {"movie_id": 78461, "review_id": "60d635ee7aecc6002d6f8107", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "_**Scooby-Doo, but serious and without Scooby**_\r\n\r\nDennis Quaid plays a creepy mortician in a central Texas town.
