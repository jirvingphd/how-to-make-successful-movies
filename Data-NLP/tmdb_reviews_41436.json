The first \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d was more effective because of its slower but steadily increasing levels of tension and unease; this time around, the tempo is a little over the place. The story isn\u2019t bad on its own, but it falls apart as soon as you connect it with the original. The first film had a more intriguing concept, with a demon nearly showing affection towards Katie, rather than the same old pact with the devil nonsense this one has going on. As a standalone film, Paranormal Activity 2 is a passable horror flick that, like its predecessor, excels at keeping things straightforward. If you liked the first film in the Paranormal Activity franchise, you\u2019d appreciate this one just as much, and even if you didn\u2019t, you might want to give it a go because it\u2019s different enough to appeal to those who didn\u2019t enjoy the previous one.", "created_at": "2022-11-01T14:37:26.792Z"}, {"movie_id": 41436, "review_id": "64be82eaac6c7908dcc0430d", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "This is kind of like a meanwhile at her sisters place.
