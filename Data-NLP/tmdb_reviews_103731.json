Urbanized types usually refer to them as \u201crednecks.\u201d While some of them may be \u201cwhite trash,\u201d most of them are not. They\u2019re independent of the government, hardworking and respectful citizens, not to mention rooted in Christian morality, although not necessarily Christians. The film respects the intelligence of the viewer, leaving it to him/her to read between the lines. It\u2019s similar to \u201cJoe,\u201d which was released a year later, but not as abrasively pessimistic and is overall better. In tone, it\u2019s akin to \u201cUndertow\u201d (2004) and \u201cSnow Angels\u201d (2007). If you appreciate those flicks, you\u2019ll like \u201cMud.\u201d \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of gems to mine: Ellis (Tye Sheridan) mirrors Mud as an adolescent. Will he make the same mistakes that brought Mud to his current state? The movie\u2019s basically a rumination on the potential in both masculinity and femininity for good or bad, but the focus is more on the toxicity of some women, which is refreshing, as Hollywood tends to paint men as evil incarnate or thoroughly inept while women are usually sterling examples of eminent nobility (Why Sure!). The film also reveals the idealization of love and how \u201clove is blind.\u201d Just because you truly love someone in a romantic sense doesn\u2019t mean s/he is good for you and that you should develop & maintain a relationship. \r\n\r\nI was never a fan of Witherspoon, but didn\u2019t dislike her either. In any case, she\u2019s quite good as the seemingly innocent-yet-toxic love interest. Bonnie Sturdivant is excellent as her teenage counterpart, May Pearl; they should\u2019ve done more with her.             \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour 10 minutes and was shot in Arkansas (Crocketts Bluff, Eudora, Dumas and Stuttgart).
