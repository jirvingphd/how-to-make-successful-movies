From the beginning, I knew exactly what I was in for but it still managed to hook me. I was invested in our two leads relationship throughout the entire runtime. Their emotional chemistry was great and it was beautiful to see the two fall in love again. This story has a slight crinkle to the romantic film genre with our lead having a relapse in memory. I thought this subject was handled well, but the movie still manages to fit itself into the same story structure of every romantic comedy, which was a bit disappointing. Rachel McAdams was great and Channing Tatum was, well, Channing Tatum. Can\u2019t ask for much from him. At the end of the day, this movie brought tears to my eyes, job well done.\r\n\r\nScore: 66% | \r\nVerdict: Good", "created_at": "2023-02-17T13:58:45.805Z"}, {"movie_id": 72570, "review_id": "63ef88155cc11d007cef3e4e", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "The Vow is a very average romantic drama with a twist.
