It has lots of great dialogue, and bold revelations in a simple way about the facts of the world. Especially like related to the sex and other grown up stuffs clarifying the little kids' doubts.\r\n\r\nAt some point I thought it was okay for the kids to watch with their parents, but it did not get better on that perspective.

So highly recommended by me.\r\n\r\n_8/10_", "created_at": "2016-11-23T18:12:12.447Z"}, {"movie_id": 334533, "review_id": "5834fd85925141691b00e385", "author_rating": 7.0, "review_text": "While Viggo's character is most certainly the protagonist, he's also not portrayed as being 100% in the right.
