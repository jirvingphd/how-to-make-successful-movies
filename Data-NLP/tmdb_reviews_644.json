I finally got around to watching it, and it wasn\u2019t until I reached the robot demolition circus (words I bet I have never seen in the same sentence before) that I realized I had watched this movie before. That is a memorable sequence.\r\n\r\nIn many respects I thought the movie was well made: the special effects, the deep thinking behind the plot, and the writing was mostly good. It almost felt like it was covering too much ground, and I felt there were a few lapses. I will mention only one, and try not to give anything away. There is a pivotal scene where John Hurt\u2019s character is with the AI child David. It took a lot of effort to get David there, so what does the guy do/ he leaves David alone and unchaperoned. And the end of the movie turns on that. Why would he wander off like that except to serve the plot?\r\n\r\nStill, the film, mirroring and projecting the story of Pinocchio into the future, was quite an achievement. I liked it, but not as much as a lot of other Spielberg efforts.", "created_at": "2021-05-08T01:23:27.007Z"}, {"movie_id": 644, "review_id": "64398ba70499f20110a874c4", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "The movie was actually pretty good.
