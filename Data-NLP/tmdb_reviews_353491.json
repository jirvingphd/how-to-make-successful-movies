I'm sure the source material is good, King is one of the best and most ingenious fantastic writers of our time and his vast literary oeuvre has already made for surprising and remarkable films. What I question is the way this adaptation was made: what are eight books converted into a two-hour film? They probably only took advantage of a handful of characters and locations and threw everything else in the trash. Works like these can only be adapted in the form of trilogies, tetralogies or, in the television market, as series. Otherwise, the source material is not properly exploited in its richness.\r\n\r\nRegardless of these issues, the film is moderately good: it all starts when the young protagonist, haunted by visions he has, finds a portal to a world he does not know, the world of his visions, and finds a Gunslinger who will help him. Deep down, he already knows the essential: the universal balance is in danger because an evil sorcerer wants to bring down the grandiose Dark Tower which, at the center of all things, harmonizes this balance and cosmic energies. I am explaining it simply and in my own words. Now the task of the two heroes is to prevent this from happening.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is really the feeling of adventure, risk, the almost constant action and the way everything unfolds quickly, without dead moments. As an entertainment film, it is very good, and if we forget that it is the worst adaptation of King ever made for the cinema, we can really have a good time watching it. The big problem here is how rushed everything feels, with the film trying to do too much without having to reach its two and a half hour runtime.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the cast is another asset that makes the film work reasonably well. None of the actors are amazing, there are no great performances, but what was done is enough to push the film in the right direction: Idris Elba is charismatic and likable without ceasing to be fearsome, something his character demanded and which the actor knew to adapt. Tom Taylor also did a good job in the role of the young hero, a role where it would have been very easy to make mistakes, be superficial or ham.

The film would have gained in quality if it had been given an additional hour, or if it had been thought of as the beginning of a broader franchise, with several sequels.

It is a book series, so we can expect a new franchise here. Another fantasy series, but is it worth is the real question. I don't know how famous is the original source, but I did not find the film any good. For me, it was another teen film like the majority of similarly themed films that flopped terribly. But here, an adult holds a prominent role that played by Idris Elba.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is just an introduction, but still the first impression failed. The youngsters might enjoy it better than the adults. Particularly the teenagers. A teenager having a series of strange dreams about another world is all actually comes true when he enters through a portal to one of those worlds in the same universe. Now he's tailed by a most dangerous force in the universe, but accompanied by a gunslinger, he has to find a way to stop an apocalypse that's going strike his world and to rest of the universe.\r\n\r\nBeing very simple could be the reason I did not enjoy it. Basically, there's no twist in it. What they have called twist was a cliche in this kind of theme. The cast was okay, and so the visuals. But it all points to the story. The sequel could get better, so lets wait and see. In the meantime, I've heard that a completely a new version of the television series is on the development. I hope it works out better than the film franchise. Finally, it is an average film, neither worth nor a waste of time!
