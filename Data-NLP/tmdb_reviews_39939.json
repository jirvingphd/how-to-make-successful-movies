I'm not a stoner, I'm not five years old, and I'm not braindead, so the mass-marketed toilet humour, sex puns and lowest common denominator references just sort of wash over me in a gross, vaguely off-putting wave of annoyance... Well throw all that out the window 'cause I absolutely fuckin' **love** _Super Troopers_. Seriously there is no reason for it, I just do. It's one of about 5 movies where, the second it finishes playing, I could just go back to the start and happily run through it all over again. In fact, I've spent a not-insignificant amount of my lifespan doing exactly that.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._", "created_at": "2018-01-25T02:14:38.146Z"}]
