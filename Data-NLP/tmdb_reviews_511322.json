They carry the whole film on their shoulders, and it's mostly due to their extremely captivating displays that I genuinely enjoyed this movie. Unfortunately, its screenplay lacks believability and some creativity since the key components of the story are predictable from the get-go.\r\n\r\nRating: B", "created_at": "2020-02-18T18:08:42.322Z"}, {"movie_id": 511322, "review_id": "5e4d8cff283ed900195cd082", "author_rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Great performances from both McKellan and Mirren which isn't surprising, but the final act with the reveal of the twist might've been unpredictable, but I like my mystery-thrillers to throw in some clues leading up to it, which this one was out of left field.
