The family lives in a magical home that is the center point for the community and is loved by the community.\r\n\r\nIn the new Disney film \u201cEncanto\u201d; audiences are told the story of how the family patriarch founded the community with a magical candle and how upon reaching a certain age; all members of her family receive a \u201cgift\u201d from the magical house which gives them an ability to help the community.
