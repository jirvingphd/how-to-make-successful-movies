This 2011 version starts off so strongly, I love the opening few scenes... humour and editing was right up my street.\r\n\r\nNow, it admittedly doesn't quite keep such a high footing throughout, but all in all I certainly found entertainment with this. For the '93 release I was split on the cast, but for this flick I had a good time watching everyone onscreen. I didn't think Matthew Macfadyen would work in this sorta role but he performs astutely.\r\n\r\nRay Stevenson and Luke Evans join Macfadyen in portraying the titular trio, again to positive effect. The famous D'Artagnan is performed by Logan Lerman here and I was impressed - a top performance from someone I hadn't seen much of before, aside from in <em>'Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief'</em>.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, Mads Mikkelsen, Milla Jovovich and Orlando Bloom spearhead the rest well. I will say that Freddie Fox and his character's part of the story didn't interest me as much but Fox is fine. Christoph Waltz is involved alongside Fox and is very forgettable... quite  a frustrating use of Waltz's (incredibly high) talents, now I think about it. Elsewhere, James Corden is iffy... and I usually like Corden as an actor.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the average rating as of typing this sentence, but I presume it'll be rather low.
