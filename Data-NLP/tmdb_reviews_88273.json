Despite running for over two hours the pacing is near perfect, as is the standout score.\r\n\r\nThe actors do wonderful jobs. Alicia Vikander is particularly brilliant, as is a fantastic Mads Mikkelsen. Mikkel F\u00f8lsgaard also brings a strong performance, early on I wasn't fully convinced but by the end he won me over tenfold. The supporting cast are very good too.\r\n\r\nSuch a well written and well told story, the whole look of how its brought to life onscreen is superb. It's a breeze to watch all the way through and by the time the third act completes it manages to bring emotion into the mix as well. Big fan.", "created_at": "2023-10-12T12:38:29.892Z"}]
