Pen\u00e9lope Cruz is obviously the pick of the bunch, she shows her quality and then some in the role; especially for the more emotive scenes. Lola Due\u00f1as, Yohana Cobo and Carmen Maura also give noteworthy performances. Blanca Portillo makes her presence felt, too.\r\n\r\nThe story is paced expertly, with the two hour run time flying by. It is quite the plot, with things of substance happening from practically the first first minutes. I really enjoyed seeing it all unfold. Everything also feels tangible, which is something I always appreciate.\r\n\r\nCruz's dodgy moment of lip-syncing aside, <em>'Volver'</em> is excellent!", "created_at": "2022-03-03T02:09:59.084Z"}]
