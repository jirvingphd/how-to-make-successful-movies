Joel Kinnaman holds this violent thriller together quite well but the rest of the cast really struggle to make much impact and it does dip in the middle somewhat. Somebody, somewhere, has clearly decided that Ana de Armas is one to watch - thus far in her career, however, the reasons why are escaping me and Rosamund Pike - even in \"Gone Girl\" - always seems a bit too detached to me; whatever her role.", "created_at": "2022-03-28T10:21:08.949Z"}]
