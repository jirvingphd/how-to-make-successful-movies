You still knew who was making it.\r\n\r\nWorld Trade Center is Stone directing a Lifetime movie with an enormous budget. It's competently made...but it's doesn't feel like it's Oliver Stone signed sealed, and delivered.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time you could sit down and watch a movie and knew he directed it without even knowing the title. Now, well, after Alexander, you can tell he had a hand in the script and that's really it.\r\n\r\nWTC doesn't have the mark of Oliver Stone on it and, honestly it sucks because of it.", "created_at": "2023-01-14T00:51:34.440Z"}]
