It makes for a better drama than a comedy, but that sort of thing is bound to happen when the movie rides the line.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of Jennifer Aniston, but the role feels more whiner-baby than her usual fair.  I am a fan of Jason Bateman, and I think he nails when to be funny, absurd, neurotic, or serious.\r\n\r\nFor a movie about swapping sperm samples, it really is a powerful story.  That family reconnection trope is excellent even without the absurdity of the premise.", "created_at": "2021-01-12T00:50:30.828Z"}]
