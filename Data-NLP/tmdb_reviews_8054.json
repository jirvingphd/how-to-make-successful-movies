It was exceptional and very wonderful. I watched the movie twice. The first time, I didn't understand the movie well and didn't like it. I did not know whether I liked the movie or not, but when I watched it again, I was fascinated and inspired by the wide imagination element that exists within the scenario.\r\n\r\nThe character of Lily Cole was amazing, she is incredibly beautiful and I have to show respect for Heath Ledger's performance and Tom Waits gave an amazing performance. Christopher Plummer stole the show with a controlled, professional performance\r\n\r\nThe animation element wasn't well managed, it could have been shown better the way it was.", "created_at": "2023-03-22T05:18:55.050Z"}]
