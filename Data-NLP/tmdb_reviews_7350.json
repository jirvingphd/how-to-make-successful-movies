The Bucket List is one such film. Its message is simple, its filming style equally so. It's performed with such quality by Nicholson and Freeman (if the whole film had just been the two of them chatting in the hospital room it would have been a winner), with director Rob Reiner astute and wily enough to let them flow, that even as the inevitable sadness follows the laughs, you will feel far better for having watched this film.\r\n\r\nRewarding adult cinema with class showing on both sides of the camera. 8.5/10", "created_at": "2014-09-25T23:51:20.633Z"}]
