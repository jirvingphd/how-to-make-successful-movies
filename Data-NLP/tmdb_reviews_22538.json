Edgar Wright creates a crazy, fun film with amazing style and effects that will make you laugh from start to finish.**\r\n\r\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World is unlike anything you have ever seen. Unique in almost every way, with its constant stream of effects being used to brilliantly stylize and transform this film into a one-of-a-kind video game/comic book marvel! Every punch effect, explosion of coins, power-up, and health bar immerse the audience further into this live-action video game world. The movie is full of quirks and pretty dorky, but it all fits with Michael Cera\u2019s goofy but endearing character. Edgar Wright\u2019s style drips from every moment of the film, even with its much faster pace and more numerous effects compared to his other movies like Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. All the gaming references and Easter eggs were hilarious. Scott Pilgrim also boasts an absurd amount of talent in its cast, with plenty of A-list stars before they were A-listers, including Captain America, Superman, Punisher, and more! Scott Pilgrim is an innovative and fun film with plenty of personality (and a little off-color humor) that make it a must-see for Conakry lovers, gamers, and Edgar Wright fans.", "created_at": "2023-02-11T05:55:18.685Z"}]
