It's forgettable, but I'm sure the core target audience will rate it. It does comes across as two separate plots, they are actually connected but it can feel like the opposite in a few moments.\r\n\r\nThere's not much else to note really. It'll divide opinion obviously, but I think it just about sneaks under the 'good' category in my books.", "created_at": "2020-08-05T15:26:57.552Z"}]
