This tall budget, combined with public hesitancy to return to theaters and the Delta variant of COVID seemingly on the verge of backtracking all the progress we\u2019ve made since the vaccine became readily available to the public, it makes you wonder if _Free Guy_ has any sort of chance of making a respectable amount of money at the box office or even just breaking even.\r\n\r\nNote: This was originally written when the film opened in theaters. _Free Guy_ would go on to make $331.5 million on a $100-$125 million budget.

Ryan Reynolds' Guy is filled with awe and wonder as he experiences things that the real world would consider mundane but, to him, are spectacular. The romance between the two lead characters is awkward at first, but the payoff at the end makes it worthwhile. All the video game easter eggs throughout make Free Guy a love letter to gamers, but the plot and acting keep it entertaining for anyone. Shawn Levy's experience with the Night at the Museum franchise and Real Steel prove his skill at making fun family films that adults can enjoy alongside their kids. Levy's lighthearted directing and Ryan Reynolds' goofy antics are a perfect combination making Free Guy a delightful movie that is worth a watch.", "created_at": "2023-01-21T20:48:36.463Z"}, {"movie_id": 550988, "review_id": "63eba3211b7294008e15aac1", "author_rating": 4.0, "review_text": "The story of this movie is a pretty cool idea but unfortunately it is somewhat ruined by Disney\u2019s woke brigade.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I quite enjoyed the first third of this movie even though said woke brigade managed to throw in some woke unnecessary bullshit about \u201cwhite privilege\u201d quite early but from there it went rather downhill.\r\n\r\nThe first third had plenty of over the top hilarious action in it. It was fun to watch. The parts where Free Guy learns to \u201clevel up\u201d and kick ass where quite cool.\r\n\r\nFrom there on it started to go downhill. The idea that Millie should access some \u201chidden level\u201d in the game to reveal evidence that Antwan had stolen code from her is rather ludicrous.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Antwan, can you say \u201cover the top\u201d? Sometimes over the top can be fun but this guy was just cringey.\r\n\r\nAlthough there were still plenty of cool CGI effects in the latter half of the movie it was pretty much ruined for me by several completely unnecessary strongly sexual scenes. I do not need some guy touching another guys \u201cboobs\u201d in my films and I do not need any boob touching at all in a movie for all audiences. Overall, at this point the movie becomes more an attempt at social engineering, propaganda and agenda feeding.\r\n\r\nThe ending? It was, not very surprisingly at this point, rather meh. To me the movie more or less ended when Millie\u2019s original level was found. The rest was just dragging it out with some rubbish about being able to do whatever you wanted and nonsense about there being so many people not wanting to actual play a game (shooter) but just mill around and watch. Sorry, people wants to play games, if not to shoot things (which most people actually wants to do) so at least to do something. Not just to watch.\r\n\r\nAlso the rubbish with Antwan trashing servers to hide evidence? The usual Hollywood nonsense. No way anyone, even a game studio, running a game or service that big would not have back-ups.\r\n\r\nToo bad, it was a good idea and some parts where really cool and fun to watch but their woke brigade and Hollywood script writer\u2019s stupidity.", "created_at": "2023-02-14T15:05:05.214Z"}, {"movie_id": 550988, "review_id": "6405107967dcc900826eb45c", "author_rating": 8.0, "review_text": "Loved this film. It's pitched just right at kids and adults. Such a clever script and great story both at face value and on a deeper level of breaking out of a rut and putting some sunglasses on.
