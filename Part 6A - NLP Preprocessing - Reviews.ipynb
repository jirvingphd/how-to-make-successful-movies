    "#### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an extension of the movies project. This portion focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a dataset of movie reviews. Students will leverage NLP tools such as NLTK, SpaCy, wordcloud, and Scikit-Learn to explore, analyze, and model text data. The ultimate goal is to establish a relationship between the textual content of the reviews and their associated ratings and subsequently predict these ratings.\n",

    "#### Dataset: TMDB Movie Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Image](https://assets.codingdojo.com/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/1700174921__pastedimage0.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10XnBycJ2bGStZJ2kWoyzZRrInKJlaiYZ/view?usp=sharing)\n",

    "[TMDB movie reviews](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLUzSYleJXqsjNMsq76yTQ5fmNlSHFJI/view?usp=sharing). Ratings range from 1 to 10\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Note: if you have an alternative text classification dataset that you would like to use for this project, **please contact your instructor immediately for approval.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**0) Update Your Project 2 Repo**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new \"Data-NLP/\" folder in your Project 2 repository.\n",
    "- Add the downloaded review file to this new Data-NLP folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you have an \"Images/\" folder. If not, create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and inspect the dataset.\n",
    "    - How many reviews?\n",
    "    - What does the distribution of ratings look like?\n",
    "    - Any null values?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the rating column to create a new target column with two groups: high-rating and low-rating groups.\n",
    "    - We recommend defining \"High-rating\" reviews as any review with a rating >=9; and \"Low-rating\" reviews as any review with a rating <=4. The middle ratings between 4 and 9 will be excluded from the analysis.\n",
    "    - You may use an alternative definition for High and Low reviews, but justify your choice in your notebook/README.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilize NLTK and SpaCy for basic text processing, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - removing stopwords\n",
    "    - tokenization\n",
    "    - lemmatization\n",
    "    - Tips:\n",
    "        - Be sure to create a custom nlp object and disable the named entity recognizer. Otherwise, processing will take a very long time!\n",
    "        - **You will want to create several versions of the data, lemmatized, tokenized, lemmatized, and joined back to one string per review, and tokenized and joined back to one string per review.** This will be useful for different analysis and modeling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Save your processed data frame in a **joblib** file saved in the \"Data-NLP/\" folder for future modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**2) EDA and Visualization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create word clouds to visualize the most frequent and significant words in each group.\n",
    "    - Remember, you can use this analysis to identify additional custom EDA stop words to use for visualization. (e.g., if the words are common in both groups)\n",
    "    - **Save your wordclouds as .png files in the \"Images/\" folder in your repo.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply nltk's `FreqDist` class to compare the frequency distribution of words in the review groups.\n",
    "    - Remember, you can use this analysis to identify additional custom EDA stop words to use for visualization. (e.g., if the words are common in both groups)\n",
    "    - **Save your freq dist plots as .png files in the \"Images/\" folder in your repo.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform n-grams analysis (bigrams and trigrams),\n",
    "    - Remember, you can use this analysis to identify additional custom stop words to use for EDA. (e.g., if the words are common in both groups)\n",
    "    - Focus on bigrams or trigrams, using NLTK's `BigramCollocationFinder` and BigramAssocMeasures classes (or the Trigram equivalent Finder and Measures) to explore commonly used groups of words for each rating-group.\n",
    "    - Describe any differences. What do these differences tell you?\n",
    "    - Save your\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform sentiment analysis to create polarity scores according to VADERS's sentiment lexicon.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Compare the sentiments of high-rating and low-rating texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Compare the average sentiment scores for high and low-rating reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Which review polarity scores don't match the ratings? Why do you think this is?\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Evaluation and Reporting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on your analyses, what should someone do (or not do) if they want to make a highly-rated movie?\n",
    "    - List 3 things associated with high-rating reviews\n",
    "    - List 3 things associated with low-rating reviews."
